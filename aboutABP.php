            <p>Applied BioPhysics, Inc. applies the results of biophysical research to provide practical tools for cell research and drug discovery.</p>

            <p>
              ECIS<sup>&trade;</sup> or Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing is an impedance based method to study many of the activities of animal cells when grown in tissue culture in real-time. These include morphological changes, cell locomotion, and other behaviors directed by the cell's cytoskeleton. ECIS<sup>&trade;</sup> technology was invented by Drs. Ivar Giaever and Charles R. Keese while working at General Electric Corporate Research and Development, but its commercial potential was not explored as it fell outside of GE's core interests. In 1991, as the applications of the technology became more apparent, Drs Giaever and Keese formed Applied BioPhysics, Inc. as a private company to develop, commercialize and market ECIS<sup>&trade;</sup> and other biophysical technologies. Applied BioPhysics is located next to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus, where several collaborative research projects are ongoing in the academic laboratories.
            <p>
              Since the formation of the company, the ECIS<sup>&trade;</sup> approach has been applied to numerous investigations including measurements of the invasive nature of cancer cells, the barrier function of endothelial cells, in vitro toxicity testing as an alternative to animal testing, and signal transduction involving GPCR's for modern drug discovery.
            <p>

            <p>
              Instruments are located throughout the United States as well as in Asia and Europe. Customers include Johns Hopkins University, The University of Tokyo, Vanderbilt University, Brown University, Genentech, and Allergan to mention a few. Drs. Giaever and Keese continue to develop new innovations to enhance the ECIS technology including most recently an automated wound healing assay and a device to study the behavior of cells under flow conditions both of which are now commercially available.

He holds a diploma in chemistry and received his PhD from the University of Muenster in 1998. His research interests are focussed on the development of non-invasive whole-cell biosensors that can be applied to follow the behaviour of mammalian cells in vitro. As the analysis of living systems is a complex task, Wegenerâ€™s research aims to bring together several sensoric principles in one device (multi-parametric sensing) so that more than one parameter can be recorded from a given cell population simultaneously. He has authored numerous research papers, book chapters and review articles on this subject. Wegener teaches courses in biochemistry, cell biology, biosensors & bioanalytics at the undergraduate and graduate level.

                  <p>
                    Joachim Wegener started to work with ECIS and related techniques in 1993 inspired by the publications of Ivar Giaever and Charles Keese, the founders of Applied BioPhysics Inc. After having received his PhD, he joined the Giaever lab for two years working as a postdoc with Giaever & Keese on cell adhesion, electroporation and cell wounding - all based on the ECIS technology. Since this time he has strong interest in modeling and simulating the electrical properties of living animal cells on conducting surfaces and developing new applications for the ECIS technology.
