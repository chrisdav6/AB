Hyaluronan (HA), and in particular the hyaluronidase Hyal-1, has been already linked to the development of BCBM, and therefore presents an interesting opportunity to develop new effective therapeutic options. HA metabolism was further discovered by the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HYAL1 and the shRNA-mediated down-regulation of HA-receptor CD44 in the brain-seeking triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231-BR. Therefore, the impact of Hyal-1 on adhesion, disruption, and invasion through the brain endothelium, both in vitro and in vivo, was studied. Our analysis points out a key role of Hyal-1 and low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA) in the formation of a pericellular HA-coat in BC cells, which in turn promotes tumor cell adhesion, disruption, and migration through the brain endothelium in vitro as well as the extent of BM in vivo. CD44 knockdown in MDA-MB-231-BR significantly reduced the pericellular HA-coat on these cells, and, consequently, tumor cell adhesion and invasion through the brain endothelium. Thus, the interaction between Hyal-1-generated LMW-HA fragments and the HA-receptor CD44 might represent a potential target for future therapeutic options in BC patients with a high risk of cerebral metastases formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birnhuber, Anna</author><author>Jandl, Katharina</author><author>Biasin, Valentina</author><author>Fließer, Elisabeth</author><author>Valzano, Francesco</author><author>Marsh, Leigh M</author><author>Krolczik, Christina</author><author>Olschewski, Andrea</author><author>Wilhelm, Jochen</author><author>Toller, Wolfgang</author><author>Heinemann, Akos</author><author>Olschewski, Horst</author><author>Wygrecka, Malgorzata</author><author>Kwapiszewska, Grazyna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pirfenidone exacerbates Th2-driven vasculopathy in a mouse model of SSc-ILD</title><secondary-title>European Respiratory Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Respiratory Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>2102347</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35332068</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/13993003.02347-2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pirfenidone exacerbates Th2-driven vasculopathy in a mouse model of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02347-2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterised by severe vasculopathy and fibrosis of various organs including the lung. Targeted treatment options for SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) are scarce. Here we assessed the effects of pirfenidone in a mouse model of SSc-ILD. Pulmonary function, inflammation and collagen deposition in response to pirfenidone were assessed in Fra-2-overexpressing (Fra-2 TG) and bleomycin-treated mice. In Fra-2 TG mice, lung transcriptome was analysed after pirfenidone treatment. In vitro, pirfenidone effects on human eosinophil and endothelial cell function were analysed using flow cytometry-based assays and electric cell-substrate impedance measurements, respectively. Pirfenidone treatment attenuated pulmonary remodelling in the bleomycin-model, but aggravated pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular remodelling in Fra-2 TG mice. Pirfenidone increased interleukin (IL)-4 levels and eosinophil numbers in lung tissue of Fra-2 TG mice without directly affecting eosinophil activation and migration in vitro . A pronounced immune response with high levels of cytokines/chemokines and disturbed endothelial integrity with low VE-cadherin levels were observed in pirfenidone-treated Fra-2 TG mice. In contrast, eosinophil, IL-4 and VE-cadherin levels were unchanged in bleomycin-treated mice and not influenced by pirfenidone. In vitro , pirfenidone exacerbated the IL-4 induced reduction of endothelial barrier resistance leading to higher leukocyte transmigration. This study shows that anti-fibrotic properties of pirfenidone may be overruled by unwanted interactions with pre-injured endothelium in a setting of high Th2 inflammation in a model of SSc-ILD. Careful ILD patient phenotyping may be required to exploit benefits of pirfenidone while avoiding therapy failure and additional lung damage in some patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kociubiński, Andrzej</author><author>Zarzeczny, Dawid</author><author>Duk, Mariusz</author><author>Bieniek, Tomasz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of Heat Flow for In Vitro Culture Monitored by Impedance Measurement</title><secondary-title>Energies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energies</full-title></periodical><pages>8231</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>electrothermal analysis</keyword><keyword>heat transfer</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>nickel/chromium alloy</keyword><keyword>sputtering</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/EN15218231</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Analysis of Heat Flow for In Vitro Culture Monitored by Impedance Measurement.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/21/8231/htm%0Ahttps://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/21/8231</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;ECIS Theory</label><abstract>The paper proposes an innovative method of using microheaters for research on cells in vitro. A method of local heating of a single culture well, compatible with an Electric Cell-substrate Impedance (ECIS) system is presented. A microheater and culture well system for cell culture was modelled. Electrical and thermal simulation of the system under operating conditions was carried out. Correct distribution of heat was observed at the site of the cell culture suspension in the medium, while not affecting the conditions in adjacent wells. As part of the experiment, a heating element of nichrome (NiCr) was created using the magnetron sputtering process. Electrical and thermal measurements of the manufactured device were carried out. It has been shown that it is possible to establish the desired temperature over the long term. In addition, the structures made were characterised by work stability, precision in maintaining the right temperature, and the possibility of being controlled with high accuracy. There is a problem with the precise and reproducible carrying out of a cell culture experiment that differs only in the process temperature. In this work, a technique for increasing the temperature locally, in a single culture well, in a medium containing eight such wells was proposed and analyzed. The use of this method will allow avoidance of the impact of potential changes in parameters other than temperature on the culture. That may occur when comparing cells grown at different temperatures by means of the ECIS (Electric Cell-substrate Impedance) method.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akhter, Mohammad S</author><author>Kubra, Khadeja-Tul</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protective effects of GHRH antagonists against hydrogen peroxide-induced lung endothelial barrier disruption</title><secondary-title>Endocrine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Endocrine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-6</pages><volume>October</volume><keywords><keyword>Growth hormone-releasing hormone</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>P53</keyword><keyword>Vascular endothelium</keyword><keyword>hormone-releasing hormone p53</keyword><keyword>in fl ammation growth</keyword><keyword>vascular endothelium oxidative stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12020-022-03226-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Protective effects of GHRH antagonists against hydrogen peroxide-induced lung endothelial barrier disruption.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12020-022-03226-1</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Purpose Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a hypothalamic hormone, which regulates growth hormone release from the anterior pituitary gland. GHRH antagonists (GHRHAnt) are anticancer agents, which also exert robust anti-inflammatory activities in malignancies. GHRHAnt exhibit anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in vascular endothelial cells, indicating their potential use against disorders related to barrier dysfunction (e.g. sepsis). Herein, we aim to investigate the effects of GHRHAnt against lung endothelial hyperpermeability. Methods The in vitro effects of GHRHAnt in H2O2-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction were investigated in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC). Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was utilized to measure transendothelial resistance, an indicator of barrier function. Results Our results demonstrate that GHRHAnt protect against H2O2-induced endothelial barrier disruption via P53 and cofilin modulation. Both proteins are crucial modulators of vascular integrity. Moreover, GHRHAnt prevent H2O2 – induced decrease in transendothelial resistance. Conclusions GHRHAnt represent a promising therapeutic intervention towards diseases related to lung endothelial hyperpermeability, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome - related or not to COVID-19 - and sepsis. Targeted medicine for those potentially lethal disorders does not exist.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maeoso-Alonso, Laura</author><author>Alonso-Olivares, Hugo</author><author>Martinez-Garcia, Nicole</author><author>Lopez-Ferreras, Lorena</author><author>Villoch-Fernandez, Javier</author><author>Puente-Santamaria, Laura</author><author>Colas-Algora, Natalia</author><author>Fernandez-Corona, Alfonso</author><author>Lorenzo-Marcos, Maria Elena</author><author>Jimenez, Benilde</author><author>Homgren, Lars</author><author>Wilhelm, Margareta</author><author>Millan, Jaime</author><author>Peso, Luis del</author><author>Claesson-Welsh, Lena</author><author>Marques, Margarita M</author><author>Marin, Maria C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p73 is required for vessel integrity controlling endothelial junctional dynamics through Angiomotin</title><secondary-title>Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>535</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cell junctions</keyword><keyword>Endothelial barrier integrity</keyword><keyword>VE-cadherin and angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Vascular morphogenesis</keyword><keyword>actin cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>cell junctions</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier integrity</keyword><keyword>p53 family</keyword><keyword>vascular morphogenesis</keyword><keyword>ve-cadherin and angiogenesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00018-022-04560-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://p73 is required for vessel integrity controlling endothelial junctional dynamics through Angiomotin.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00018-022-04560-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Modeling;TEER</label><abstract>Preservation of blood vessel integrity, which is critical for normal physiology and organ function, is controlled at multiple levels, including endothelial junctions. However, the mechanism that controls the adequate assembly of endothelial cell junctions is not fully defined. Here, we uncover TAp73 transcription factor as a vascular architect that orchestrates transcriptional programs involved in cell junction establishment and developmental blood vessel morphogenesis and identify Angiomotin (AMOT) as a TAp73 direct transcriptional target. Knockdown of p73 in endothelial cells not only results in decreased Angiomotin expression and localization at intercellular junctions, but also affects its downstream function regarding Yes-associated protein (YAP) cytoplasmic sequestration upon cell–cell contact. Analysis of adherens junctional morphology after p73-knockdown in human endothelial cells revealed striking alterations, particularly a sharp increase in serrated junctions and actin bundles appearing as stress fibers, both features associated with enhanced barrier permeability. In turn, stabilization of Angiomotin levels rescued those junctional defects, confirming that TAp73 controls endothelial junction dynamics, at least in part, through the regulation of Angiomotin. The observed defects in monolayer integrity were linked to hyperpermeability and reduced transendothelial electric resistance. Moreover, p73-knockout retinas showed a defective sprout morphology coupled with hemorrhages, highlighting the physiological relevance of p73 regulation in the maintenance of vessel integrity in vivo. We propose a new model in which TAp73 acts as a vascular architect integrating transcriptional programs that will impinge with Angiomotin/YAP signaling to maintain junctional dynamics and integrity, while balancing endothelial cell rearrangements in angiogenic vessels.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gimbel, Anna Theresa</author><author>Koziarek, Susanne</author><author>Theodorou, Kosta</author><author>Schulz, Jana Felicitas</author><author>Stanicek, Laura</author><author>Ali, Tamer</author><author>Günther, Stefan</author><author>Kumar, Sandeep</author><author>Jo, Hanjoong</author><author>Hübner, Norbert</author><author>Maegdefessel, Lars</author><author>Dimmeler, Stefanie</author><author>Heesch, Sebastiaan van</author><author>Boon, Reinier A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aging-regulated TUG1 is dispensable for endothelial cell function</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0265160</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Aging-regulated TUG1 is dispensable for endothelial cell function.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The evolutionary conserved Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) is a ubiquitously expressed gene that is one of the highest expressed genes in human and rodent endothelial cells (ECs). We here show that TUG1 expression decreases significantly in aging mouse carotid artery ECs and human ECs in vitro, indicating a potential role in the aging endothelial vasculature system. We therefore investigated if, and how, TUG1 might function in aging ECs, but despite extensive phenotyping found no alterations in basal EC proliferation, apoptosis, barrier function, migration, mitochondrial function, or monocyte adhesion upon TUG1 silencing in vitro. TUG1 knockdown did slightly and significantly decrease cumulative sprout length upon vascular endothelial growth factor A stimulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), though TUG1-silenced HUVECs displayed no transcriptome-wide mRNA expression changes explaining this effect. Further, ectopic expression of the highly conserved and recently discovered 153 amino acid protein translated from certain TUG1 transcript isoforms did not alter angiogenic sprouting in vitro. Our data show that, despite a high expression and strong evolutionary conservation of both the TUG1 locus and the protein sequence it encodes, TUG1 does not seem to play a major role in basic endothelial cell function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prendecka-Wrobel, Monika</author><author>Pigon-Zajac, Dominika</author><author>Jaszek, Magdalena</author><author>Matuszewska, Anna</author><author>Stefaniuk, Dawid</author><author>Opielak, Grzegorz</author><author>Piotrowska, Katarzyna</author><author>Rahnama-Hezavah, Mansur</author><author>Malecka-Massalska, Teresa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) as a Convenient Tool to Assess the Potential of Low Molecular Fraction Derived from Medicinal Fungus Cerrena unicolor in Action on L929 and CT-26 Cell Lines</title><secondary-title>Molecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules</full-title></periodical><volume>27</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Cerrena unicolor</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>anticancer properties</keyword><keyword>colon cancer</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>medicinal fungus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules27196251</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) as a Convenient Tool to Assess the Potential of Low Molecular Fraction Derived from Medicinal Fungus Cerrena unicolor in Action on L929 and CT-26 Cell Lines.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27196251</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity;Theory</label><abstract>The increase in the incidence of cancer has contributed to the search for new therapeutic methods. In recent years, the use of preparations of natural origin from medical fungi has increased. One such active substance is the extracellular, low molecular active fraction obtained from the medicinal fungus Cerrena unicolor. This study aimed to monitor the pharmacokinetics of different concentrations of substances isolated from the medicinal fungus Cerrena unicolor (ex-LMS) using the ECIS technique. In the study, mouse L929 fibroblasts and colon cancer CT26 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of the active fractions obtained from Cerrena unicolor: C1 = 2.285 (μg/mL); C2 = 22.85 (μg/mL); and C3 = 228.5 (μg/mL). This study demonstrated that the tested preparation from Cerrena unicolor had no considerable effect on the resistance, capacitance, and impedance of L929 fibroblast cells, which was an indicator of no significant effect on its physiological processes. At the same time, those parameters exhibited a decrease in colon cancer cell viability. Following our previous and current studies on Cerrena unicolor, ex-LMS extracts can be safely used in anticancer therapy or chemoprevention with no significant harmful effects on normal cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Mingyuan</author><author>Meng, Xiangyuan</author><author>Cheng, Zhihua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Apremilast exerts protective effects on stroke outcomes and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through regulating Rho-associated protein kinase 2 expression</title><secondary-title>Brain and Behavior</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain and Behavior</full-title></periodical><pages>e2677</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Claudin-5</keyword><keyword>ROCK2</keyword><keyword>apremilast (APR)</keyword><keyword>blood–brain barrier (BBB)</keyword><keyword>endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>stroke</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/brb3.2677</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Apremilast exerts protective effects on stroke outcomes and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through regulating Rho‐associated protein kinase 2 expression.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fbrb3.2677</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Aims: Stroke is a devastating event and a huge public health concern worldwide. Apremilast (APR) is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 involved in various neurological diseases, including stroke. However, the protective effects of APR on stroke have not been investigated. Here, we explored the effects of APR on stroke outcomes and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke mice model. Results: The results show that APR attenuated neurological injury in MCAO mice with decreased neurological deficit scores and infarct size, as well as increased hanging grip time. The increased BBB permeability and decreased expression of the tight junction protein Claudin-5 in MCAO mice were attenuated by APR treatment. APR treatment also mitigated neuroinflammation in MCAO mice, as shown by the decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. In vitro assays also proved that APR ameliorated the oxygen/glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced increase in endothelial permeability and restored the expression of Claudin-5 in bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells. Moreover, overexpression of ROCK2 in bEnd.3 cells abolished the protective effects of APR on endothelial permeability against OGD/R induction. Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate that APR showed significant efficacy on ischemic stroke outcomes by alleviating enhanced BBB permeability and neuroinflammation by inhibiting ROCK2. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic window for ischemic stroke.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mauerhofer, Christina</author><author>Afonyushkin, Taras</author><author>Oskolkova, Olga V.</author><author>Hellauer, Klara</author><author>Gesslbauer, Bernd</author><author>Schmerda, Jasmin</author><author>Ke, Yunbo</author><author>Zimmer, Andreas</author><author>Birukova, Anna A.</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G.</author><author>Bochkov, Valery</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low Concentrations of Oxidized Phospholipids Increase Stress Tolerance of Endothelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants</full-title></periodical><pages>1741</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>cell survival</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell stress</keyword><keyword>oxidized phospholipids</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/antiox11091741</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Low Concentrations of Oxidized Phospholipids Increase Stress Tolerance of Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fantiox11091741</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are generated by enzymatic or autooxidation of esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) residues. OxPLs are present in circulation and atherosclerotic plaques where they are thought to induce predominantly proinflammatory and toxic changes in endothelial (ECs) and other cell types. Unexpectedly, we found that low concentrations of OxPLs were not toxic but protected ECs from stress induced by serum deprivation or cytostatic drugs. The protective effect was observed in ECs obtained from different vessels and was monitored using a variety of readouts based on different biological and chemical principles. Analysis of the structure–activity relationship identified oxidized or missing fatty acid residue (OxPLs or Lyso-PLs, respectively) as a prerequisite for the protective action of a PL. Protective OxPLs or Lyso-PLs acquired detergent-like properties and formed in solution aggregates &lt;10 nm in diameter (likely micelles), which were in striking contrast with large aggregates (&gt;1000 nm, likely multilayer liposomes) produced by nonoxidized precursor PLs. Because surfactants, OxPLs, and Lyso-PLs are known to extract membrane cholesterol, we tested if this effect might trigger the protection of endothelial cells. The protective action of OxPLs and Lyso-PLs was inhibited by cotreatment with cholesterol and mimicked by cholesterol-binding beta-cyclodextrin but not inactive α-cyclodextrin. Wide-scale mRNA expression analysis in four types of ECs showed the induction of genes encoding for heat shock proteins (HSPs) and secreted prosurvival peptides and proteins. Inducers of HSPs, chemical chaperones, and pure prosurvival factors mimicked the protective action of OxPLs/Lyso-PLs. We hypothesize that oxidation changes the physicochemical properties of PLs, thus promoting membrane cholesterol redistribution or extraction leading to the expression of intra- and extracellular prosurvival factors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moztarzadeh, Sina</author><author>Radeva, Mariya Y</author><author>Sepic, Sara</author><author>Schuster, Katharina</author><author>Hamad, Ibrahim</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author><author>Ponce, Alexander García</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lack of adducin impairs the stability of endothelial adherens and tight junctions and may be required for cAMP ‑ Rac1 ‑ mediated endothelial barrier stabilization</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>0123456789</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens junctions</keyword><keyword>RHO signalling</keyword><keyword>Tight junctions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-18964-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lack of adducin impairs the stability of endothelial adherens and tight junctions and may be required for cAMP-Rac1-mediated endothelial barrier stabilization.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18964-5</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Adducin (Add) is an actin binding protein participating in the stabilization of actin/spectrin networks, epithelial junctional turnover and cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension. Recently, we demonstrated that Add is required for adherens junctions (AJ) integrity. Here we hypothesized that Add regulates tight junctions (TJ) as well and may play a role in cAMP-mediated barrier enhancement. We evaluated the role of Add in MyEnd cells isolated from WT and Add-Knock-Out (KO) mice. Our results indicate that the lack of Add drastically alters the junctional localization and protein levels of major AJ and TJ components, including VE-Cadherin and claudin-5. We also showed that cAMP signaling induced by treatment with forskolin and rolipram (F/R) enhances the barrier integrity of WT but not Add-KO cells. The latter showed no junctional reorganization upon cAMP increase. The absence of Add also led to higher protein levels of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. In vehicle-treated cells the activation level of Rac1 did not differ significantly when WT and Add-KO cells were compared. However, the lack of Add led to increased activity of RhoA. Moreover, F/R treatment triggered Rac1 activation only in WT cells. The function of Rac1 and RhoA per se was unaffected by the total ablation of Add, since direct activation with CN04 was still possible in both cell lines and led to improved endothelial barrier function. In the current study, we demonstrate that Add is required for the maintenance of endothelial barrier by regulating both AJ and TJ. Our data show that Add may act upstream of Rac1 as it is necessary for its activation via cAMP.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jansen, Ineke D C</author><author>Velzen, Thijs Van</author><author>Vries, Teun J De</author><author>Szulcek, Robert</author><author>van Loon, Jack J.W.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time quantification of osteoclastic resorptive activity by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>August</issue><keywords><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>bone</keyword><keyword>osteoclast</keyword><keyword>real-time quantification</keyword><keyword>resorption</keyword><keyword>sensor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcell.2022.921066</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Real-time quantification of osteoclastic resorptive activity by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffcell.2022.921066</url></web-urls></urls><label>Theory</label><abstract>In several diseases, bone resorption by osteoclasts is dysregulated. Thus far, no simple technique for real-time measurement of resorption is available. Here, we introduce an impedimetric bioassay for real-time monitoring of resorption by making use of the electrical insulating properties of the resorbable substrate calcium phosphate. Different chemical stimuli were applied to (pre)osteoclasts cultured on a layer of calcium phosphate in multi-well plates containing electrodes. By this, osteoclast activity can be measured continuously over days, and the effects of stimulating or inhibiting factors can be quantified. When cells were cultured in the presence of an inflammatory factor such as IL-1β, the resorptive activity started earlier. The measured decline in resistance was higher at culture day 5 than at cultures with M-CSF or M-CSF + RANKL (M-CSF norm. Resistance = 1, M-CSF + RANKL = 0.7, M-CSF + RANKL + IL-1β = 0.5). However, at day 11, this difference had nearly disappeared. Likewise, bisphosphonates were shown to inhibit osteoclastic activity. Our findings illustrate the importance of real-time monitoring; wherefore, this method has high potential not only for the study of osteoclast resorptive activity in the context of osteoclast function and diseases but also could find application in high-throughput drug-testing studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez, Keegan</author><author>Camacho, Alexandra</author><author>Jacquez, Quiteria</author><author>Amistadi, Mary Kay</author><author>Medina, Sebastian</author><author>Zychowski, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lung-Based, Exosome Inhibition Mediates Systemic Impacts Following Particulate Matter Exposure</title><secondary-title>Toxics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Toxics</full-title></periodical><pages>457</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>brain</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>lung</keyword><keyword>metals</keyword><keyword>particulate matter</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/toxics10080457</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lung-Based, Exosome Inhibition Mediates Systemic Impacts Following Particulate Matter Exposure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Ftoxics10080457</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;TEER;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Particulate matter (PM) exposure is a global health issue that impacts both urban and rural communities. Residential communities in the Southwestern United States have expressed concerns regarding the health impacts of fugitive PM from rural, legacy mine-sites. In addition, the recent literature suggests that exosomes may play a role in driving toxicological phenotypes following inhaled exposures. In this study, we assessed exosome-driven mechanisms and systemic health impacts following inhaled dust exposure, using a rodent model. Using an exosome inhibitor, GW4869 (10 μM), we inhibited exosome generation in the lungs of mice via oropharyngeal aspiration. We then exposed mice to previously characterized inhaled particulate matter (PM) from a legacy mine-site and subsequently assessed downstream behavioral, cellular, and molecular biomarkers in lung, serum, and brain tissue. Results indicated that CCL-2 was significantly upregulated in the lung tissue and downregulated in the brain (p &lt; 0.05) following PM exposure. Additional experiments revealed cerebrovascular barrier integrity deficits and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in the mine-PM exposure group, mechanistically dependent on exosome inhibition. An increased stress and anxiety response, based on the open-field test, was noted in the mine-PM exposure group, and subsequently mitigated with GW4869 intervention. Exosome lipidomics revealed 240 and eight significantly altered positive-ion lipids and negative-ion lipids, respectively, across the three treatment groups. Generally, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids were significantly downregulated in the PM group, compared to FA. In conclusion, these data suggest that systemic, toxic impacts of inhaled PM may be mechanistically dependent on lung-derived, circulating exosomes, thereby driving a systemic, proinflammatory phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Copic, Dragan</author><author>Direder, Martin</author><author>Schossleitner, Klaudia</author><author>Laggner, Maria</author><author>Klas, Katharina</author><author>Bormann, Daniel</author><author>Ankersmit, Hendrik Jan</author><author>Mildner, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paracrine factors of stressed peripheral blood mononuclear cells activate pro-angiogenic and anti-proteolytic processes in whole blood cells and protect the endothelial barrier</title><secondary-title>Pharmaceutics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmaceutics</full-title></periodical><pages>1600</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/pharmaceutics14081600</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Paracrine Factors of Stressed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Activate Proangiogenic and Anti-Proteolytic Processes in Whole Blood Cells and Protect the Endothelial Barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fpharmaceutics14081600</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Tissue regenerative properties have been attributed to secreted paracrine factors derived from stem cells and other cell types. Especially, the secretome of γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCsec) has been shown to possess high tissue-regenerative and pro-angiogenic capacities in a variety of preclinical studies. In the light of future therapeutic intravenous applications of PBMCsec, we investigated possible effects of PBMCsec on circulating white blood cells and endothelial cells lining the vasculature. Methods To identify changes in the transcriptional profile of white blood cells treated with PBMCSec, whole blood was drawn from healthy individuals and stimulated with PBMCsec for 8 hours ex vivo before further processing for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). In addition, we performed in vitro assay to confirm findings arising from the transcriptional profiling. Results Addition of PBMCsec to whole blood significantly altered the gene signature of granulocytes (17 genes), T-cells (45 genes), B-cells (72 genes) and most prominently monocytes (322 genes). We detected a strong upregulation of several tissue-regenerative and pro-angiogenic cyto- and chemokines in monocytes, including VEGFA, CXCL1 and CXCL5 . Intriguingly, inhibitors of endopeptidase activity, such as SERPINB2 , were also strongly induced. Measurement of the trans-endothelial electrical resistance of primary human microvascular endothelial cells revealed a strong barrier-protective effect of PBMCsec after barrier disruption. Conclusion Together, we show that PBMCsec induces angiogenic and proteolytic processes in the blood and is able to attenuate endothelial barrier damage. These regenerative properties suggest that systemic application of PBMCsec might be a promising novel strategy to restore damaged organs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walker, Carsten C F</author><author>Sordillo, Lorraine M</author><author>Contreras, G Andres</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anandamide Alters Barrier Integrity of Bovine Vascular Endothelial Cells during Endotoxin Challenge</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants</full-title></periodical><pages>1461</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>anandamide</keyword><keyword>arachidonoylethanolamide</keyword><keyword>barrier integrity</keyword><keyword>cannabinoid receptor-1</keyword><keyword>endocannabinoids</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>lipopolysaccharide</keyword><keyword>oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>reactive oxygen species</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/antiox11081461</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Anandamide Alters Barrier Integrity of Bovine Vascular Endothelial Cells during Endotoxin Challenge.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fantiox11081461</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Vascular endothelial cells are crucial mediators of inflammation during infectious diseases, due to their ability to produce lipid-based inflammatory mediators and facilitate leukocyte migration and translocation to infected tissues. Mastitis is the costliest infectious disease in North America, with over two billion dollars in annual costs due to loss of milk production, medical treatment, and potential loss of the animal. Infections caused by coliform bacteria are particularly deleterious, causing a negative impact on cow well-being and a high mortality rate. Dysfunction and breakdown of the endothelial barrier is a key part of the pathology of coliform mastitis. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), shown to modulate inflammatory responses of vascular endothelial cells in humans and rodents, may be a novel target for inflammatory modulation in dairy cows. The endocannabinoid (EC) arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) is a potent anti- or pro-inflammatory mediator in endothelial cells, depending on location, timing, and concentration. We hypothesized that elevated AEA during LPS challenge will impair endothelial barrier integrity via increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of apoptotic pathways. Challenge of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with 25 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 8 h induced AEA synthesis, increased expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 (CB1/2) and the AEA synthesizing enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), while decreasing gene expression of the AEA degradation enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Trans endothelial resistance (TER), measured through electrical resistance across the monolayer, increased 2 h after 0.5 µM AEA treatment and decreased with 5 µM AEA, compared to LPS alone. Addition of AEA to BAEC challenged with LPS induced mitochondrial dysfunction via increased ROS production, cytochrome-C release, and activation of caspase 3/7. Antagonism of CB1 by 1 µM AM251 ameliorated AEA induced ROS production and cytochrome-C release. Addition of AM251 also eliminated 2 h TER increase and improved TER following 5 µM AEA. Doses of 0.5, 1, and 5 µM AEA delayed endothelial barrier recovery, which was eliminated by the addition of AM251. Mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of apoptotic pathways in response to AEA treatment during LPS challenge of BAEC may act to delay inflammatory resolution and contribute to endothelial dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walter, Yohan</author><author>Hubbard, Anne</author><author>Benoit, Allie</author><author>Jank, Erika</author><author>Salas, Olivia</author><author>Jordan, Destiny</author><author>Ekpenyong, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of In Vitro Assays for Advancing Radioimmunotherapy against Brain Tumors</title><secondary-title>Biomedicines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedicines</full-title></periodical><pages>1-25</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>brain cancers</keyword><keyword>durvalumab</keyword><keyword>glioblastoma</keyword><keyword>immune checkpoint inhibitors</keyword><keyword>immunoradiotherapy</keyword><keyword>immunotherapy</keyword><keyword>radioimmunotherapy</keyword><keyword>radiotherapy</keyword><keyword>temozolomide</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biomedicines10081796</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Development of In Vitro Assays for Advancing Radioimmunotherapy against Brain Tumors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiomedicines10081796</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. Due to high resistance to treatment, local invasion, and a high risk of recurrence, GBM patient prognoses are often dismal, with median survival around 15 months. The current standard of care is threefold: surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). However, patient survival has only marginally improved. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a fourth modality under clinical trials and aims at combining immunotherapeutic agents with radiotherapy. Here, we develop in vitro assays for the rapid evaluation of RIT strategies. Using a standard cell irradiator and an Electric Cell Impedance Sensor, we quantify cell migration following the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with TMZ and RIT with durvalumab, a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. We measure cell survival using a cloud-based clonogenic assay. Irradiated T98G and U87 GBM cells migrate significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more than untreated cells in the first 20–40 h post-treatment. Addition of TMZ increases migration rates for T98G at 20 Gy (p &lt; 0.01). Neither TMZ nor durvalumab significantly change cell survival in 21 days post-treatment. Interestingly, durvalumab abolishes the enhanced migration effect, indicating possible potency against local invasion. These results provide parameters for the rapid supplementary evaluation of RIT against brain tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zemskov, Evgeny A</author><author>Gross, Christine M</author><author>Aggarwal, Saurabh</author><author>Zemskova, Marina A</author><author>Wu, Xiaomin</author><author>Gu, Chenxin</author><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Tang, Haiyang</author><author>Black, Stephen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NF- κ B-dependent repression of Sox18 transcription factor requires the epigenetic regulators histone deacetylases 1 and 2 in acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>epigenetics</keyword><keyword>histone deacetylases</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>transcriptional repression</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphys.2022.947537</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NF-κB-dependent repression of Sox18 transcription factor requires the epigenetic regulators histone deacetylases 1 and 2 in acute lung injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphys.2022.947537</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>In acute lung injury (ALI), the NF-κB-mediated downregulation of Sox18 gene expression leads to the disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier. Previous studies have suggested that the action of NF-κB as a transcriptional repressor also requires the action of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate and further delineate the mechanism of Sox18 repression during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI. Using selective inhibitors and specific siRNA-driven depletion of HDACs 1-3 in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) we were able to demonstrate a critical role for HDACs 1 and 2 in the LPS-mediated repression of Sox18 gene expression and the loss of endothelial monolayer integrity. Moreover, our data demonstrate that HDAC1 associates with a transcription-repressive complex within the NF-κB-binding site of Sox18 promoter. Further, we were able to show that the selective inhibitor of HDAC1, tacedinaline, significantly reduced the endothelial permeability and injury associated with LPS challenge in the mouse lung. Taken together, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that transcription repressors HDACs 1 and 2 are involved in pathological mechanism of ALI and can be considered as therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, Graham</author><author>McLeod, Andrew</author><author>Bagnaninchi, Pierre</author><author>Dhillon, Baljean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative Action Spectroscopy Reveals ARPE-19 Sensitivity to Long-Wave Ultraviolet Radiation at 350 nm and 380 nm</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>14223</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-17251-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Quantitative action spectroscopy reveals ARPE19 sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation at 350 nm and 380 nm.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17251-7</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The role of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure in the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been debated for decades with epidemiological evidence failing to find a clear consensus for or against it playing a role. A key reason for this is a lack of foundational research into the response of living retinal tissue to UVR in regard to AMD-specific parameters of tissue function. We therefore explored the response of cultured retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the loss of which heralds advanced AMD, to specific wavelengths of UVR across the UV-B and UV-A bands found in natural sunlight. Using a bespoke in vitro UVR exposure apparatus coupled with bandpass filters we exposed the immortalised RPE cell line, ARPE-19, to 10nm bands of UVR between 290 and 405nm. Physical cell dynamics were assessed during exposure in cells cultured upon specialist electrode culture plates which allow for continuous, non-invasive electrostatic interrogation of key cell parameters during exposure such as monolayer coverage and tight-junction integrity. UVR exposures were also utilised to quantify wavelength-specific effects using a rapid cell viability assay and a phenotypic profiling assay which was leveraged to simultaneously quantify intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear morphology, mitochondrial stress, epithelial integrity and cell viability as part of a phenotypic profiling approach to quantifying the effects of UVR. Electrical impedance assessment revealed unforeseen detrimental effects of UV-A, beginning at 350nm, alongside previously demonstrated UV-B impacts. Cell viability analysis also highlighted increased effects at 350nm as well as 380nm. Effects at 350nm were further substantiated by high content image analysis which highlighted increased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. We conclude that ARPE-19 cells exhibit a previously uncharacterised sensitivity to UV-A radiation, specifically at 350nm and somewhat less at 380nm. If upheld in vivo , such sensitivity will have impacts upon geoepidemiological risk scoring of AMD. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xiaobo</author><author>Wang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Bauer, Alexander T</author><author>Kirschfink, Michael</author><author>Ding, Peipei</author><author>Gebhardt, Christoffer</author><author>Borsig, Lubor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neutrophils activated by membrane attack complexes increase the permeability of melanoma blood vessels</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><volume>119</volume><issue>33</issue><keywords><keyword>NETs</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>melanoma</keyword><keyword>membrane attack complex</keyword><keyword>neutrophil</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.2122716119</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Neutrophils activated by membrane attack complexes increase the permeability of melanoma blood vessels.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.2122716119</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The microenvironment of malignant melanomas defines the properties of tumor blood vessels and regulates infiltration and vascular dissemination of immune and cancer cells, respectively. Previous research in other cancer entities suggested the complement system as an essential part of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we confirm activation of the complement system in samples of melanoma patients and murine melanomas. We identified the tumor endothelium as the starting point of the complement cascade. Generation of complement-derived C5a promoted the recruitment of neutrophils. Upon contact with the vascular endothelium, neutrophils were further activated by complement membrane attack complexes (MACs). MAC-activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Close to the blood vessel wall, NETs opened the endothelial barrier as indicated by an enhanced vascular leakage. This facilitated the entrance of melanoma cells into the circulation and their systemic spread. Depletion of neutrophils or lack of MAC formation in complement component 6 (C6)–deficient animals protected the vascular endothelium and prevented vascular intravasation of melanoma cells. Our data suggest that inhibition of MAC-mediated neutrophil activation is a potent strategy to abolish hematogenous dissemination in melanoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abdul Shukkur, Ebrahim</author><author>Thanzeela, Ebrahim</author><author>Hussein, Kan</author><author>Ahmed S., Ibrahim</author><author>W.

Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing or ECIS is a non-invasive method to measure real-time cellular behaviors including barrier function and cell migration. The current study uses ECIS technology to assess and optimize human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial cells to generate quantifiable measurements that accurately reflect changes in cell behavior in vitro. Five cell densities were assessed in two different media to determine the optimal conditions for monitoring of cellular behavior over time. Parameters of evaluation included: overall impedance (Z), barrier resistance (R), cell capacitance (C), and mathematical modeling of the R data to further generate Rb (the electrical resistance between HUCLs), α (the resistance between the HUCLs and the substrate), and Cm (the capacitance of the cell membrane) measurements. All parameters of assessment strongly indicated DMEM/F12 at 60,000 cells as the optimal condition for ECIS assessment of HUCLs. Furthermore, this work highlights the ability of the sensitive ECIS biosensor technology to comprehensively and quantitatively assess corneal epithelial cell structure and function and the importance of optimizing not only cell density, but choice of media used for in vitro culturing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Batori, Robert K</author><author>Chen, Feng</author><author>Bordan, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Haigh, Stephen</author><author>Su, Yunchao</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Barman, Scott A</author><author>Stepp, David W</author><author>Chakraborty, Trinad</author><author>Lucas, Rudolf</author><author>Fulton, David J R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protective role of Cav-1 in endothelial barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>July</issue><keywords><keyword>barrier-function</keyword><keyword>calcium-influx</keyword><keyword>caveolin-1</keyword><keyword>endocytosis</keyword><keyword>pneumolysin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2022.945656</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Protective role of Cav-1 in pneumolysin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2022.945656</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Pneumolysin (PLY) is a bacterial pore forming toxin and primary virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumonia, a major cause of pneumonia. PLY binds cholesterol-rich domains of the endothelial cell (EC) plasma membrane resulting in pore assembly and increased intracellular (IC) Ca2+ levels that compromise endothelial barrier integrity. Caveolae are specialized plasmalemma microdomains of ECs enriched in cholesterol. We hypothesized that the abundance of cholesterol-rich domains in EC plasma membranes confers cellular susceptibility to PLY. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found increased PLY-induced IC Ca2+ following membrane cholesterol depletion. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an essential structural protein of caveolae and its regulation by cholesterol levels suggested a possible role in EC barrier function. Indeed, Cav-1 and its scaffolding domain peptide protected the endothelial barrier from PLY-induced disruption. In loss of function experiments, Cav-1 was knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9 or silenced in human lung microvascular ECs. Loss of Cav-1 significantly enhanced the ability of PLY to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity. Rescue experiments with re-expression of Cav-1 or its scaffolding domain peptide protected the EC barrier against PLY-induced barrier disruption. Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is known to regulate caveolar membrane endocytosis. Inhibition of endocytosis, with dynamin inhibitors or siDNM2 amplified PLY induced EC barrier dysfunction. These results suggest that Cav-1 protects the endothelial barrier against PLY by promoting endocytosis of damaged membrane, thus reducing calcium entry and PLY-dependent signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anchan, Akshata</author><author>Finlay, Graeme</author><author>Angel, Catherine E</author><author>Hucklesby, James J W</author><author>Graham, Scott E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Melanoma Mediated Disruption of Brain Endothelial Barrier Integrity Is Not Prevented by the Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinases and Proteases</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><pages>660</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>blood–brain barrier</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>matrix metalloproteinases</keyword><keyword>melanoma</keyword><keyword>proteases</keyword><keyword>xCELLigence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios12080660</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Melanoma Mediated Disruption of Brain Endothelial Barrier Integrity Is Not Prevented by the Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinases and Proteases.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/12/8/660#</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>We have previously shown that human melanoma cells rapidly decrease human brain endothelial barrier strength. Our findings showed a fast mechanism of melanoma mediated barrier disruption, which was localised to the paracellular junctions of the brain endothelial cells. Melanoma cells are known to release molecules which cleave the surrounding matrix and allow traversal within and out of their metastatic niche. Enzymatic families, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and proteases are heavily implicated in this process and their complex nature in vivo makes them an intriguing family to assess in melanoma metastasis. Herein, we assessed the expression of MMPs and other proteases in melanoma conditioned media. Our results showed evidence of a high expression of MMP-2, but not MMP-1, -3 or -9. Other proteases including Cathepsins D and B were also detected. Recombinant MMP-2 was added to the apical face of brain endothelial cells (hCMVECs), to measure the change in barrier integrity using biosensor technology. Surprisingly, this showed no decrease in barrier strength. The addition of potent MMP inhibitors (batimastat, marimastat, ONO4817) and other protease inhibitors (such as aprotinin, Pefabloc SC and bestatin) to the brain endothelial cells, in the presence of various melanoma lines, showed no reduction in the melanoma mediated barrier disruption. The inhibitors batimastat, Pefabloc SC, antipain and bestatin alone decreased the barrier strength. These results suggest that although some MMPs and proteases are released by melanoma cells, there is no direct evidence that they are substantially involved in the initial melanoma-mediated disruption of the brain endothelium</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keerthi, S.</author><author>Nandkumar, A Maya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical cell ‑ substrate impedance sensing ( ECIS ) as a tool to study microbial ‑ cell interactions</title><secondary-title>In vitro models</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>In vitro models</full-title></periodical><issue>0123456789</issue><keywords><keyword>Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Impedance measurement</keyword><keyword>In vitro model</keyword><keyword>Microbial–cell interaction</keyword><keyword>cell</keyword><keyword>electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>impedance measurement</keyword><keyword>in vitro model</keyword><keyword>interaction</keyword><keyword>microbial</keyword><keyword>pseudomonas infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s44164-022-00029-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) as a tool to study microbial-cell interactions.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44164-022-00029-6</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>ECIS is an impedance-based method to study the cellular responses to a stimulus. Manipulating the alternating current frequencies in ECIS helped reveal the adherent monolayer properties, including morphology, spreading, proliferation, changes in junctional proteins and barrier integrity. Our objective in the current study was to understand the progression of Pseudomonas infection in the airway epithelial cells using ECIS. The study also aimed at understanding the feasibility of using ECIS to study drug interactions on monolayer barrier functions. A significant reduction in impedance was noted in response to Pseudomonas infection, indicating loss of morphology and cell viability. At frequencies lower than 2000 Hz, a gradual decrease in impedance was observed during the early phase of infection, indicating a loss of junctional integrity. On the other hand, at frequencies above 16,000 Hz, a reduction in impedance was observed only during the later phases of infection. This suggested that Pseudomonas reduced the barrier integrity of cells during the early phase to gain access into the cells. Changes in cell morphology and subsequent loss of cell viability occur during the later phases of infection. Azithromycin is known to increase the barrier integrity of the monolayer (by increasing the expression of junctional proteins). We observed that pretreatment of A549 monolayers with azithromycin inhibited the progression of infection by Pseudomonas ATCC 27853 and delayed the infection of the epithelium by S373 clinical isolate. Our study is the report on the mechanism of bacterial infection progression using ECIS. It can be observed that an improvement in the barrier integrity reduces the susceptibility to bacterial infections. ECIS was demonstrated to be an effective tool for studying microbial–cell interactions and the role of drug molecules.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kremer, Veerle</author><author>Stanicek, Laura</author><author>van Ingen, Eva</author><author>Bink, Diewertje I.</author><author>Hilderink, Sarah</author><author>Tijsen, Anke J.</author><author>Wittig, Ilka</author><author>Mägdefessel, Lars</author><author>Nossent, Anne Yaël</author><author>Boon, Reinier A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The long non-coding RNA MEG8 induces an endothelial barrier through regulation of microRNA-370 and -494 processing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cell Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cell Science</full-title></periodical><volume>135</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>non-coding rna</keyword><keyword>post-transcriptional modification</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.259671</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The long non-coding RNA MEG8 induces an endothelial barrier through regulation of microRNA-370 and -494 processing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1242%2Fjcs.259671</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>The 14q32 locus is an imprinted region in the human genome which contains multiple non-coding RNAs. We investigated the role of the long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 8 (MEG8) in endothelial function and its underlying mechanism. A 5-fold increase in MEG8 was observed with increased passage number in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), suggesting MEG8 is induced during aging. MEG8 knockdown resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in senescence, suggesting MEG8 might be protective during aging. The endothelial barrier was also impaired after MEG8 silencing. MEG8 knockdown resulted in reduced expression of microRNA (miRNA)-370 and -494 but not -127, -487b and -410. Overexpression of miRNA-370 or -494 partially rescued the MEG8-silencing-induced barrier loss. Mechanistically, MEG8 regulates expression of miRNA-370 and -494 at the mature miRNA level through interaction with the RNA-binding proteins cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multi-enzyme complex subunit β (HADHB). Mature miRNA-370 and miRNA-494 were found to interact with CIRBP, whereas precursor miRNA-370 and miRNA-494 were found to interact with HADHB. Individual CIRBP and HADHB silencing resulted in downregulation of miRNA-370 and induction of miRNA-494. These results suggest MEG8 interacts with CIRBP and HADHB and contributes to miRNA processing at the post-transcriptional level.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carter, Nigeste</author><author>Mathiesen, Allison H</author><author>Miller, Noel</author><author>Brown, Michael</author><author>Biancatelli, Ruben M L Colunga</author><author>Catravas, John D</author><author>Dobrian, Anca D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles impair the angiogenic response of coronary artery endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>July</issue><keywords><keyword>adipose tissue</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>exosomes</keyword><keyword>miRNA</keyword><keyword>proliferation</keyword><keyword>wound response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcvm.2022.923081</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles impair the angiogenic response of coronary artery endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffcvm.2022.923081</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;TEER;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prominent cause of death of adults in the United States with coronary artery disease being the most common type of CVD. Following a myocardial event, the coronary endothelium plays an important role in the recovery of the ischemic myocardium. Specifically, endothelial cells (EC) must be able to elicit a robust angiogenic response necessary for tissue revascularization and repair. However, local or distant cues may prevent effective revascularization. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are produced by all cells and endothelium is a rich source of EVs that have access to the main circulation thereby potentially impacting local and distant tissue function. Systemic inflammation associated with conditions such as obesity as well as the acute inflammatory response elicited by a cardiac event can significantly increase the EV release by endothelium and alter their miRNA, protein or lipid cargo. Our laboratory has previously shown that EVs released by adipose tissue endothelial cells exposed to chronic inflammation have angiostatic effects on naïve adipose tissue EC in vitro. Whether the observed effect is specific to EVs from adipose tissue endothelium or is a more general feature of the endothelial EVs exposed to pro-inflammatory cues is currently unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the angiostatic effects of EVs produced by EC from the coronary artery and adipose microvasculature exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC) on naïve coronary artery EC. We have found that EVs from both EC sources have angiostatic effects on the coronary endothelium. EVs produced by cells in a pro-inflammatory environment reduced proliferation and barrier function of EC without impacting cellular senescence. Some of these functional effects could be attributed to the miRNA cargo of EVs. Several miRNAs such as miR-451, let-7, or miR-23a impact on multiple pathways responsible for proliferation, cellular permeability and angiogenesis. Collectively, our data suggests that EVs may compete with pro-angiogenic cues in the ischemic myocardium therefore slowing down the repair response. Acute treatments with inhibitors that prevent endogenous EV release immediately after an ischemic event may contribute to better efficacy of therapeutic approaches using functionalized exogenous EVs or other pro-angiogenic approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mascarenhas, Joseph B</author><author>Song, Jin H</author><author>Gaber, Amir A</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R</author><author>Cress, Anne E</author><author>Camp, Sara M</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Actin-, Cortactin- and Ena-VASP-Linked Complex Contributes to Endothelial Cell Focal Adhesion and Vascular Barrier Regulation</title><secondary-title>Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>329-339</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Ena-VASP like protein</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine-1-phosphate</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.33594/000000553</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://An Actin-, Cortactin- and Ena-VASP-Linked Complex Contributes to Endothelial Cell Focal Adhesion and Vascular Barrier Regulation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.33594%2F000000553</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background/Aims: Increase in vascular permeability is a cardinal feature of all inflammatory diseases and represents an imbalance in vascular contractile forces and barrier-restorative forces, both of which are highly dependent on actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In addition to the involvement of key vascular barrier-regulatory, actin-binding proteins, such as nmMLCK and cortactin, we recently demonstrated a role for a member of the Ena-VASP family known as Ena-VASP-like (EVL) in promoting vascular focal adhesion (FA) remodeling and endothelial cell (EC) barrier restoration/preservation. Methods: To further understand the role of EVL in EC barrier-regulatory processes, we examined EVL-cytoskeletal protein interactions in FA dynamics in vitro utilizing lung EC and in vivo murine models of acute inflammatory lung injury. Deletion mapping studies and immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detail the interaction between EVL and cortactin, and further evaluated by assessment of changes in vascular EC permeability following disruption of EVL-cortactin interaction. Results: Initial studies focusing on the actin-binding proteins, nmMLCK and cortactin, utilized deletion mapping of the cortactin gene (CTTN) to identify cortactin domains critical for EVL-cortactin interaction and verified the role of actin in promoting EVL-cortactin interaction. A role for profilins, actin-binding proteins that regulate actin polymerization, was established in facilitating EVL-FA binding. Conclusion: In summary, these studies further substantiate EVL participation in regulation of vascular barrier integrity and in the highly choreographed cytoskeletal interactions between key FA and cytoskeletal partners.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siddharth, Sumit</author><author>Kuppusamy, Panjamurthy</author><author>Wu, Qitong</author><author>Nagalingam, Arumugam</author><author>Saxena, Neeraj K</author><author>Sharma, Dipali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metformin Enhances the Anti-Cancer Efficacy of Sorafenib via Suppressing MAPK / ERK / Stat3 Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>8083</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>ERK</keyword><keyword>MAPK</keyword><keyword>Stat3</keyword><keyword>combination treatment</keyword><keyword>hepatocellular carcinoma</keyword><keyword>metformin</keyword><keyword>sorafenib</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23158083</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Metformin Enhances the Anti-Cancer Efficacy of Sorafenib via Suppressing MAPK ERK Stat3 Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23158083</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence, as well as related mortality, has been steadily increasing in the USA and across the globe, partly due to the lack of effective therapeutic options for advanced HCC. Though sorafenib is considered standard-of-care for advanced HCC, it only improves median survival by a few months when compared to placebo. Sorafenib is also associated with several unpleasant side effects that often lead to early abatement of therapy. Here, we investigate whether a combination regimen including low-dose sorafenib and a non-toxic dose of anti-diabetic drug metformin can achieve effective inhibition of HCC. Indeed, combining metformin with low-dose sorafenib inhibited growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion potential of HCC cells. We observed a 5.3- and 1.9-fold increase in sub-G1 population in the combination treatment compared to sorafenib alone. We found that the combination of metformin enhanced the efficacy of sorafenib and inhibited the MAPK/ERK/Stat3 axis. Our in vivo studies corroborated the in vitro findings, and mice harboring HepG2-derived tumors showed effective tumor reduction upon treatment with low-dose sorafenib and metformin combination. This work sheds light on a therapeutic strategy aiming to augment sorafenib efficacy or dose-de-escalation that may prove beneficial in circumventing sorafenib resistance as well as minimizing related side effects.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gueguen, Emilie</author><author>Morsy, Yasser</author><author>Charl, Michael</author><author>Kramer, Stefanie D.</author><author>Zaugg, Michael</author><author>Hersberger, Martin</author><author>Rogler, Gerhard</author><author>Wawrzyniak, Marcin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial Barrier Disruption by Lipid Emulsions Containing a High Amount of N3 Fatty Acids (Omegaven) but Not N6 Fatty Acids (Intralipid)</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>lipid emulsions</keyword><keyword>parenteral nutrition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells11142202</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial Barrier Disruption by Lipid Emulsions Containing a High Amount of N3 Fatty Acids (Omegaven) but Not N6 Fatty Acids (Intralipid).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells11142202</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity;Proliferation</label><abstract>Lipid emulsions are crucial for life-saving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Their composition provides a high amount of essential fatty acids and calories for millions of patients with serious diseases. Nevertheless, several TPN-mediated side-effects have been reported in over 90% of patients. This project aimed to investigate the effect of a high amount of ω3 fatty acids (Omegaven®) emulsion vs. a high amount of ω6 fatty acids (Intralipid®) emulsions on the endothelial barrier function. EA.hy926 cell line was cultured and incubated with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mM lipid emulsions. The influence of these lipid emulsions on the barrier function was assessed using ECIS technology, immunofluorescent microscopy, viability measurements by flow cytometry, multiplex cytokines analysis, and qRT-PCR. BODIPY staining confirmed the uptake of fatty acids by endothelial cells. ECIS measurements demonstrated that a high concentration of Omegaven® prevents barrier formation and impairs the barrier function by inducing cell detachment. Moreover, the expression of VE-cadherin and F-actin formation showed a reorganization of the cell structure within 2 h of 1 mM Omegaven® addition. Interestingly, the study’s findings contradict previous studies and revealed that Omegaven® at high concentration, but not Intralipid, induces cell detachments, impairing endothelial cells’ barrier function. In summary, our studies shed new light on the effect of lipid emulsions on the endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Liu, Xiaobo</author><author>Obser, Tobias</author><author>Bauer, Alexander T.</author><author>Heyes, Martin</author><author>Starzonek, Sarah</author><author>Zulal, Mina</author><author>Opitz, Karena</author><author>Ott, Leonie</author><author>Riethdorf, Sabine</author><author>Lange, Tobias</author><author>Pantel, Klaus</author><author>Bendas, Gerd</author><author>Schneider, Stefan W.</author><author>Kusche-Gullberg, Marion</author><author>Gorzelanny, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heparan sulfate dependent binding of plasmatic von Willebrand factor to blood circulating melanoma cells attenuates metastasis</title><secondary-title>Matrix Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Matrix Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>76-94</pages><volume>111</volume><keywords><keyword>Circulating tumor cells</keyword><keyword>Heparan sulfate</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Metastasis</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>35690300</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.matbio.2022.06.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Heparan sulfate dependent binding of plasmatic von Willebrand factor to blood circulating melanoma cells attenuates metastasis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2022.06.002</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment</label><abstract>Heparan sulfate (HS), a highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycan, is ubiquitously present in all tissues and also exposed on the surface of mammalian cells. A plethora of molecules such as growth factors, cytokines or coagulation factors bear HS binding sites. Accordingly, HS controls the communication of cells with their environment and therefore numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and cancer cell metastasis. In the present work, we found that HS exposed by blood circulating melanoma cells recruited considerable amounts of plasmatic von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the cellular surface. Analyses assisted by super-resolution microscopy indicated that HS and vWF formed a tight molecular complex. Enzymatic removal of HS or genetic engineering of the HS biosynthesis showed that a reduced length of the HS chains or complete lack of HS was associated with significantly reduced vWF encapsulation. In microfluidic experiments, mimicking a tumor-activated vascular system, we found that vWF-HS complexes prevented vascular adhesion. In line with this, single molecular force spectroscopy suggested that the vWF-HS complex promoted the repulsion of circulating cancer cells from the blood vessel wall to counteract metastasis. Experiments in wild type and vWF knockout mice confirmed that the HS-vWF complex at the melanoma cell surface attenuated hematogenous metastasis, whereas melanoma cells lacking HS evade the anti-metastatic recognition by vWF. Analysis of tissue samples obtained from melanoma patients validated that metastatic melanoma cells produce less HS. Transcriptome data further suggest that attenuated expression of HS-related genes correlate with metastases and reduced patients’ survival. In conclusion, we showed that HS-mediated binding of plasmatic vWF to the cellular surface can reduce the hematogenous spread of melanoma. Cancer cells with low HS levels evade vWF recognition and are thus prone to form metastases. Therefore, therapeutic expansion of the cancer cell exposed HS may prevent tumor progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mekala, Naveen</author><author>Gheewala, Nishi</author><author>Rom, Slava</author><author>Sriram, Uma</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blocking of P2X7r Reduces Mitochondrial Stress Induced by Alcohol and Electronic Cigarette Exposure in Brain</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants</full-title></periodical><pages>1328</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>ca 2</keyword><keyword>electronic cigarette</keyword><keyword>ethanol</keyword><keyword>extracellular atp</keyword><keyword>mitochondrial stress</keyword><keyword>p2x7r</keyword><keyword>signaling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/antiox11071328</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Blocking of P2X7r Reduces Mitochondrial Stress Induced by Alcohol and Electronic Cigarette Exposure in Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fantiox11071328</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Studies in both humans and animal models demonstrated that chronic alcohol/e-cigarette (e-Cig) exposure affects mitochondrial function and impairs barrier function in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Identification of the signaling pathways by which chronic alcohol/e-Cig exposure induces mitochondrial damage in BMVEC is vital for protection of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). To address the issue, we treated human BMVEC [hBMVECs (D3 cell-line)] with ethanol (ETH) [100 mM], acetaldehyde (ALD) [100 μM], or e-cigarette (e-Cig) [35 ng/mL of 1.8% or 0% nicotine] conditioned medium and showed reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) measured by a Seahorse analyzer. Seahorse data were further complemented with the expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins detected by Western blots. We also observed cytosolic escape of ATP and its extracellular release due to the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential caused by ETH, ALD, or 1.8% e-Cig exposure. Moreover ETH, ALD, or 1.8% e-Cig treatment resulted in elevated purinergic P2X7r and TRPV1 channel gene expression, measured using qPCR. We also demonstrated the protective role of P2X7r antagonist A804598 (10 μM) in restoring mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation levels and preventing extracellular ATP release. In a BBB functional assay using trans-endothelial electrical resistance, we showed that blocking the P2X7r channel enhanced barrier function. In summary, we identified the potential common pathways of mitochondrial injury caused by ETH, ALD, and 1.8% e-Cig which allow new protective interventions. We are further investigating the potential link between P2X7 regulatory pathways and mitochondrial health.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oeyen, Merel</author><author>Meyen, Eef</author><author>Doijen, Jordi</author><author>Schols, Dominique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In-Depth Characterization of Zika Virus Inhibitors Using Cell-Based Electircal Impedance</title><secondary-title>Microbiology Spectrum</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiology Spectrum</full-title></periodical><volume>July</volume><keywords><keyword>2022 oeyen et al</keyword><keyword>antivirals</keyword><keyword>cell-based biosensor</keyword><keyword>cellular assay</keyword><keyword>copyright</keyword><keyword>editor laura ruth delgui</keyword><keyword>histología y embriología de</keyword><keyword>ihem</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>instituto de</keyword><keyword>mendoza</keyword><keyword>this is an open-</keyword><keyword>zika virus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>American Society for Microbiology</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/spectrum.00491-22</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In-Depth Characterization of Zika Virus Inhibitors Using Cell-Based Electrical Impedance.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00491-22</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Virology</label><abstract>In this study, we use electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), an established cell-based electrical impedance (CEI) technology, to decipher the kinetic cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) in susceptible human A549 lung epithelial cells and to evaluate several classes of compounds with reported antiviral activity (two entry inhibitors and two replication inhibitors). To validate the assay, we compare the results with those obtained with more traditional in vitro methods based on cell viability and viral yield readouts. We demonstrate that CEI can detect viral infection in a sensitive manner and can be used to determine antiviral potency. Moreover, CEI has multiple benefits compared to conventional assays: the technique is less laborious and better at visualizing the dynamic antiviral activity profile of the compounds, while also it has the ability to determine interesting time points that can be selected as endpoints in assays without continuous readout. We describe several parameters to characterize the compounds’ cytotoxicity and their antiviral activity profile. In addition, the CEI patterns provide valuable additional information about the presumed mechanism of action of these compounds. Finally, as a proof of concept, we used CEI to evaluate the antiviral activity of a small series of compounds, for which we demonstrate that the sulfonated polymer PRO2000 inhibits ZIKV with a response profile representative for a viral entry inhibitor. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that CEI is a powerful technology to evaluate and characterize compounds against ZIKV replication in a real-time, label-free, and noninvasive manner. IMPORTANCE Zika virus can cause serious disease in humans. Unfortunately, no antiviral drugs are available to treat infection. Here, we use an impedance-based method to continuously monitor virus infection in—and damage to—human cells. We can determine the Zika viral dose with this technique and also evaluate whether antiviral compounds protect the cells from damage caused by virus replication. We also show that this technique can be used to further unravel the characteristics of these compounds, such as their toxicity to the cells, and that it might even give further insight in their mechanism of antiviral action. Finally, we also find a novel Zika virus inhibitor, PRO2000. Overall, in this study, we use the impedance technology to—for the first time—evaluate compounds with anti-Zika virus properties, and therefore it can add valuable information in the further search for antiviral drugs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ke, Yunbo</author><author>Proctor, Julie</author><author>Zhang, Chenou</author><author>Medina, Juliana</author><author>Miller, Catriona</author><author>Junhyun, Kim</author><author>Grissom, Thomas</author><author>Birukova, Anna</author><author>Fiskum, Gary</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of endothelial barrier dysfunction by serum factors in rats subjected to traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock</title><secondary-title>Physiological Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>e15350</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</keyword><keyword>controlled cortical impact (CCI)</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>hemorrhagic shock (HS)</keyword><keyword>serum</keyword><keyword>trans‐endothelial resistance (TER)</keyword><keyword>traumatic brain injury (TBI)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35555157</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.14814/phy2.15350</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Induction of endothelial barrier dysfunction by serum factors in rats subjected to traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.14814%2Fphy2.15350</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with the development of indirect acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the causative relationship between TBI and lung injury remains unclear. To explore potential mechanisms linking TBI with the development of ARDS, we characterized the effects of serum factors released following TBI and hemorrhagic shock (HS) in a rat model on the pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction, a key feature of ARDS. We found that serum samples from animals exposed to both controlled cortical impact (CCI) and HS, but not from sham‐operated rats induced significant barrier dysfunction in human pulmonary artery EC monolayers at 2 days post injury. Thrombin inhibitor and thrombin receptor antagonist attenuated the acute phase of the serum‐induced trans‐endothelial resistance (TER) decline caused by CCI‐HS serum, but not in later time points. However, both the early and late phases of CCI‐HS‐induced EC permeability were inhibited by heparin. The barrier disruptive effects of CCI‐HS serum were also prevented by serum preincubation with heparin‐sepharose. Pulmonary EC treated for 3 h with serum from CCI‐HS rats demonstrated a significant decline in expression of EC junctional protein, VE‐Cadherin, and disassembly of peripheral EC adherens junction complexes monitored by immunostaining with VE‐cadherin antibody. These results suggest that exposure to CCI‐HS causes early and late‐phase barrier disruptive effects in vascular endothelium. While thrombin‐PAR1 signaling has been identified as a mechanism of acute EC permeability increase by CCI‐HS serum, the factor(s) defining long‐term EC barrier disruption in CCI‐HS model remains to be determined.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shashikanth, Nitesh</author><author>France, Marion M</author><author>Xiao, Ruyue</author><author>Haest, Xenia</author><author>Rizzo, Heather E</author><author>Yeste, Jose</author><author>Reiner, Johannes</author><author>Turner, Jerrold R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tight junction channel regulation by interclaudin interference</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>3780</issue><keywords><keyword>Homeostasis</keyword><keyword>Mucosal immunology</keyword><keyword>Tight junctions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Springer Nature</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-022-31587-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tight junction channel regulation by interclaudin interference.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41467-022-31587-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Tight junctions form selectively permeable seals across the paracellular space. Both barrier function and selective permeability have been attributed to members of the claudin protein family, which can be categorized as pore-forming or barrier-forming. Here, we show that claudin-4, a prototypic barrier-forming claudin, reduces paracellular permeability by a previously unrecognized mechanism. Claudin-4 knockout or overexpression has minimal effects on tight junction permeability in the absence of pore-forming claudins. However, claudin-4 selectively inhibits flux across cation channels formed by claudins 2 or 15. Claudin-4-induced loss of claudin channel function is accompanied by reduced anchoring and subsequent endocytosis of pore-forming claudins. Analyses in nonepithelial cells show that claudin-4, which is incapable of independent polymerization, disrupts polymeric strands and higher order meshworks formed by claudins 2, 7, 15, and 19. This process of interclaudin interference, in which one claudin disrupts higher order structures and channels formed by a different claudin, represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of barrier regulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tolardo, Valentina</author><author>Magr, Davide</author><author>Fumagalli, Francesco</author><author>Cassano, Domenico</author><author>Athanassiou, Athanassia</author><author>Fragouli, Despina</author><author>Gioria, Sabrina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Vitro High-Throughput Toxicological Assessment of Nanoplastics</title><secondary-title>Nanomaterials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanomaterials</full-title></periodical><pages>1947</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>high content screening</keyword><keyword>in vitro assays</keyword><keyword>laser ablation</keyword><keyword>nanoplastics</keyword><keyword>nanotoxicology</keyword><keyword>polycarbonate</keyword><keyword>polyethylene terephthalate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/nano12121947</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In Vitro High-Throughput Toxicological Assessment of Nanoplastics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fnano12121947</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Proliferation</label><abstract>Sub-micrometer particles derived from the fragmentation of plastics in the environment can enter the food chain and reach humans, posing significant health risks. To date, there is a lack of adequate toxicological assessment of the effects of nanoplastics (NPs) in mammalian systems, particularly in humans. In this work, we evaluated the potential toxic effects of three different NPs in vitro: two NPs obtained by laser ablation (polycarbonate (PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET1)) and one (PET2) produced by nanoprecipitation. The physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a smaller size, a larger size distribution, and a higher degree of surface oxidation for the particles produced by laser ablation. Toxicological evaluation performed on human cell line models (HePG2 and Caco-2) showed a higher toxic effect for the particles synthesized by laser ablation, with PC more toxic than PET. Interestingly, on differentiated Caco-2 cells, a conventional intestinal barrier model, none of the NPs produced toxic effects.

However, the relative contribution of the various isoforms of PDI in tumorigenesis is not clear. Methods The content of PDI isoforms in 22 cancer cells lines was investigated using LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis. The effects of PDIA1, PDIA3 and PDIA17 inhibition on the proliferation, migration and adhesion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, identified as high and low PDIA17 expressing cells, respectively, were assessed using novel aromatic N-sulphonamides of aziridine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives as PDI inhibitors. Results PDIA1 and PDIA3 were the most abundant in cancer cell lysates and were also detected extracellularly in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7). Some cancer cell lines (e.g., MCF-7, HT-29) showed upregulated expression of PDIA17, whereas in others (e.g., MDA-MB-231, 67NR), PDIA17 was not detected. The simultaneous inhibition of PDIA1 and PDIA3 showed similar anti-proliferative effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. However, the inhibition of PDIA1 and PDIA17 in the MCF-7 cell line resulted in more effective anti-adhesive and anti-proliferative effects. Conclusions PDIA1 and PDIA3 represent major isoforms of multiple cancer cells, and their non-selective inhibition displays significant anti-proliferative effects irrespective of whether or not PDIA17 is present. The more pronounced anti-adhesive effects of PDI inhibition in hormone-sensitive MCF-7 cells featured by higher levels of PDIs when compared to triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells suggests that targeting extracellular PDIA1 and PDIA3 with or without additional PDIA17 inhibition may represent a strategy for personalized anti-adhesive, anti-metastatic therapy in cancers with high PDI expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fouani, Youssef</author><author>Kirchhof, Luisa</author><author>Stanicek, Laura</author><author>Luxán, Guillermo</author><author>Heumüller, Andreas W</author><author>Knau, Andrea</author><author>Fischer, Ariane</author><author>Devraj, Kavi</author><author>John, David</author><author>Neumann, Philipp</author><author>Bindereif, Albrecht</author><author>Boon, Reinier A</author><author>Liebner, Stefan</author><author>Wittig, Ilka</author><author>Mogler, Carolin</author><author>Karimova, Madina</author><author>Dimmeler, Stefanie</author><author>Jaé, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The splicing‐regulatory lncRNA NTRAS sustains vascular integrity</title><secondary-title>EMBO reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EMBO reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>alternative splicing</keyword><keyword>long non-coding rna</keyword><keyword>tight junctions</keyword><keyword>vascular</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><accession-num>35527520</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/embr.202154157</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The splicing‐regulatory lncRNA NTRAS sustains vascular integrity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.15252%2Fembr.202154157</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Vascular integrity is essential for organ homeostasis to prevent edema formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and often expressed in a cell type‐specific manner. By screening for endothelial‐enriched lncRNAs, we identified the undescribed lncRNA NTRAS to control endothelial cell functions. Silencing of NTRAS induces endothelial cell dysfunction in vitro and increases vascular permeability and lethality in mice. Biochemical analysis revealed that NTRAS, through its CA‐dinucleotide repeat motif, sequesters the splicing regulator hnRNPL to control alternative splicing of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1; also named zona occludens 1, ZO‐1) pre‐mRNA. Deletion of the hnRNPL binding motif in mice (Ntras ∆CA/∆CA) significantly repressed TJP1 exon 20 usage, favoring expression of the TJP1α‐ isoform, which augments permeability of the endothelial monolayer. Ntras ∆CA/∆CA mice further showed reduced retinal vessel growth and increased vascular permeability and myocarditis. In summary, this study demonstrates that NTRAS is an essential gatekeeper of vascular integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamaguchi, Eiichiro</author><author>Yao, Joshua</author><author>Aymond, Allison</author><author>Chrisey, Douglas B</author><author>Nieman, Gary F</author><author>Bates, Jason H T</author><author>Gaver, Donald P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing ( ECIS ) as a Platform for Evaluating Barrier-Function Susceptibility and Damage from Pulmonary Atelectrauma</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>ards</keyword><keyword>atelectrauma</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>ecis technology</keyword><keyword>lung</keyword><keyword>mechanical ventilation</keyword><keyword>pulmonary disease</keyword><keyword>vili</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios12060390</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) as a Platform for Evaluating Barrier-Function Susceptibility and Damage from Pulmonary Atelectrauma.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12060390</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;Flow</label><abstract>Biophysical insults that either reduce barrier function (COVID-19, smoke inhalation, aspiration, and inflammation) or increase mechanical stress (surfactant dysfunction) make the lung more susceptible to atelectrauma. We investigate the susceptibility and time-dependent disruption of barrier function associated with pulmonary atelectrauma of epithelial cells that occurs in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). This in vitro study was performed using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) as a noninvasive evaluating technique for repetitive stress stimulus/response on monolayers of the human lung epithelial cell line NCI-H441. Atelectrauma was mimicked through recruitment/derecruitment (RD) of a semi-infinite air bubble to the fluid-occluded micro-channel. We show that a confluent monolayer with a high level of barrier function is nearly impervious to atelectrauma for hundreds of RD events. Nevertheless, barrier function is eventually diminished, and after a critical number of RD insults, the monolayer disintegrates exponentially. Confluent layers with lower initial barrier function are less resilient. These results indicate that the first line of defense from atelectrauma resides with intercellular binding. After disruption, the epithelial layer community protection is diminished and atelectrauma ensues. ECIS may provide a platform for identifying damaging stimuli, ventilation scenarios, or pharmaceuticals that can reduce susceptibility or enhance barrier-function recovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bushra, Sumbul</author><author>Al-sadeq, Duaa W</author><author>Bari, Redwana</author><author>Sahara, Afifah</author><author>Fadel, Amina</author><author>Rizk, Nasser</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adiponectin Ameliorates Hyperglycemia-Induced Retinal Endothelial Dysfunction , Highlighting Pathways , Regulators , and Networks</title><secondary-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3135-3166</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>adiponectin</keyword><keyword>bioinformatic analysis</keyword><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>diabetic retinopathy</keyword><keyword>human microvascular retinal endothelial</keyword><keyword>hyperglycemia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/JIR.S358594</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Adiponectin Ameliorates Hyperglycemia-Induced Retinal Endothelial Dysfunction, Highlighting Pathways, Regulators, and Networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.2147%2FJIR.S358594</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is multifaced. A low level of circulating adiponectin (APN) in type 2 diabetes is associated with microvasculature complications, and its role in the evolution of DR is complex. Aim This study is designed to explore the potential impact of APN in the pathogenesis of DR, linking the changes in cellular and biological processes with the pathways, networks, and regulators involved in its actions. Methods Human microvascular retinal endothelial cells (HMRECs) were exposed to 30mM glucose (HG) and treated with globular adiponectin (30μg/mL) for 24 hours. The cells were evaluated for reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and apoptosis. RT-PCR profile arrays were utilized to evaluate the profile of genes involved in endothelial functions, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, and adhesion molecules for hyperglycemic HMRECs treated with adiponectin. In addition, the barrier function, leukocyte migration, and angiogenesis were evaluated. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) were outlined, and bioinformatic analysis was applied. Results Adiponectin suppresses ROS production and apoptosis in HMRECs under HG conditions. Adiponectin improved migration and barrier functions in hyperglycemic cells. The bioinformatic analysis highlighted that the signaling pathways of integrin, HMGB1, and p38 AMPK, are mainly involved in the actions of APN on HMRECs. APN significantly affects molecular functions, including the adhesion of cells, chemotaxis, migration of WBCs, and angiogenesis. STAT3, NFKB, IKBKB, and mir-8 are the top upstream regulators, which affect the expressions of the genes of the data set, while TNF and TGFB1 are the top regulators. Conclusion Adiponectin significantly counteracts hyperglycemia at various cellular and molecular levels, reducing its impact on the pathophysiological progression towards DR in vitro using HMRECs. Adiponectin ameliorates inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and endothelial barrier dysfunction using a causal network of NFBk complex, TNF, and HMGB1 and integrin pathways.

Patients with recurrent/metastatic disease undergo combination chemotherapy containing cetuximab, the monoclonal antibody used against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Cetuximab augments the effect of chemotherapy; however, a significant number of patients show therapy resistance. The mechanism of resistance is yet to be unveiled, although extracellular alterations of the receptor have been reported, and their role in cetuximab failure has been proposed. Aims: Here, we investigate possible effects of the multi-exon deletion variant (EGFRvIII), and the single nucleotide polymorphism EGFR R521K on cetuximab efficacy. Results: Our results show that in HNSCC patients, the EGFRvIII allele frequency is under 1%; therefore, it cannot lead to common resistance. EGFR R521K, present in 42% of the patients, is investigated in vitro in four HNSCC cell lines (two wild-type and two heterozygous for EGFR R521K). While no direct effect is found to be related to the EGFR status, cells harboring R521K show a reduced sensitivity in ADCC experiments and in vivo xenograft experiments. However, this preclinical difference is not reflected in the progression-free or overall survival of HNSCC patients. Furthermore, NK cell and macrophage presence in tumors is not related to EGFR R521K. Discussion: Our results suggest that EGFR R521K, unlike reported previously, is unable to cause cetuximab resistance in HNSCC patients; therefore, its screening before therapy selection is not justifiable.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liao, Heng-yi</author><author>Huang, Chun-chung</author><author>Chao, Shih-chi</author><author>Chiang, Chien-ping</author><author>Tang, Bo-hsuan</author><author>Lee, Shiao-Pieng</author><author>Wang, Jehng-Kang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time Monitoring the Cytotoxic Effect of Andrographolide on Human Oral Epidermoid Carcinoma Cells</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><pages>304</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>andrographolide</keyword><keyword>electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>oral squamous carcinoma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios12050304</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Real-Time Monitoring the Cytotoxic Effect of Andrographolide on Human Oral Epidermoid Carcinoma Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12050304</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Micromotion;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Andrographolide is an active diterpenoid compound extracted from Andrographis paniculata. It exhibits antiinflammatory and anticancer effects. Previous studies show that it is non-toxic to experimental animals. The leading causes of cancer are chronic inflammation and high blood glucose. This study determines the cytotoxic effect of andrographolide on cellular morphology, viability, and migration for human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell Meng-1 (OEC-M1). We use electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to measure the subsequent overall impedance changes of the cell monolayer in response to different concentrations of andrographolide for 24 h (10–100 µM). The results for exposure of OEC-M1 cells to andrographolide (10–100 µM) for 24 h show a concentration-dependent decrease in the overall measured resistance at 4 kHz. AlamarBlue cell viability assay and annexin V also show the apoptotic effect of andrographolide on OEC-M1 cells. A reduction in wound-healing recovery rate is observed for cells treated with 30 μM andrographolide. This study demonstrates that ECIS can be used for the in vitro screening of anticancer drugs. ECIS detects the cytotoxic effect of drugs earlier than traditional biochemical assays, and it is more sensitive and shows more detail.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gonzales, Janae</author><author>Holbert, Kelsey</author><author>Czysz, Kamryn</author><author>George, Joseph</author><author>Fernandes, Caroline</author><author>Fraidenburg, Dustin R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemin Induced Endothelial Dysfunction and Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition Contributes to the Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Hypertension Due to Chronic Hemolysis</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4763</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>endothelial to mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>hemolysis</keyword><keyword>pulmonary hypertension</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23094763</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Hemin-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction and Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition in the Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Hypertension Due to Chronic Hemolysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23094763</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease is an independent predictor of mortality, yet the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease in chronic hemolytic disorders remains incompletely understood and treatment options are limited primarily to supportive care. The release of extracellular hemoglobin has been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension, and in this study we explored the direct effects of hemin, the oxidized moiety of heme, on the pulmonary artery endothelium. We found that low dose hemin exposure leads to significantly increased endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and cytokine release as markers of endothelial dysfunction. Protein expression changes in our pulmonary artery endothelial cells showed upregulation of mesenchymal markers after hemin treatment in conjunction with a decrease in endothelial markers. Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) resulting from hemin exposure was further confirmed by showing upregulation of the transcription factors SNAI1 and SLUG, known to regulate EndoMT. Lastly, given the endothelial dysfunction and phenotypic transition observed, the endothelial cytoskeleton was considered a potential novel target. Inhibiting myosin light chain kinase, to prevent phosphorylation of myosin light chain and cytoskeletal contraction, attenuated hemin-induced endothelial hyper-proliferation, migration, and cytokine release. The findings in this study implicate hemin as a key inducer of endothelial dysfunction through EndoMT, which may play an important role in pulmonary vascular remodeling during the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronic hemolytic states.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parajuli, Pravin</author><author>Gokulan, Kuppan</author><author>Khare, Sangeeta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preclinical In Vitro Model to Assess the Changes in Permeability and Cytotoxicity of Polarized Intestinal Epithelial Cells during Exposure Mimicking Oral or Intravenous Routes : An Example of Arsenite Exposure</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4851</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>2022 by the authors</keyword><keyword>arsenic</keyword><keyword>basel</keyword><keyword>copyright</keyword><keyword>immunotoxicity</keyword><keyword>in vitro model</keyword><keyword>intestinal permeability</keyword><keyword>intravenous exposure</keyword><keyword>licensee mdpi</keyword><keyword>oral exposure</keyword><keyword>switzerland</keyword><keyword>translational model</keyword><keyword>xenobiotic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23094851</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Preclinical In Vitro Model to Assess the Changes in Permeability and Cytotoxicity of Polarized Intestinal Epithelial Cells during Exposure Mimicking Oral or Intravenous Routes An Example of Arsenite Exposure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23094851</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;TEER24</label><abstract>The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is exposed to xenobiotics, including drugs, through both: local (oral) and systemic routes. Despite the advances in drug discovery and in vitro pre-clinical models, there is a lack of appropriate translational models to distinguish the impact of these routes of exposure. Changes in intestinal permeability has been observed in different gastrointestinal and systemic diseases. This study utilized one such xenobiotic, arsenic, to which more than 200 million people around the globe are exposed via their food, drinking water, work environment, soil, and air. The purpose of this study was to establish an in vitro model to mimic gastrointestinal tract exposure to xenobiotics via oral or intravenous routes. To achieve this, we compared the route (mimicking oral and intravenous exposure to GIT and the dose response (using threshold approach) of trivalent and pentavalent inorganic arsenic species on the permeability of in vitro cultured polarized T84 cells, an example of intestinal epithelial cells. Arsenic treatment to polarized T84 cells via the apical and basolateral compartment of the trans-well system reflected oral or intravenous routes of exposure in vivo, respectively. Sodium arsenite, sodium arsenate, dimethyl arsenic acid sodium salt (DMAV), and disodium methyl arsonate hydrate (MMAV) were assessed for their effects on intestinal permeability by measuring the change in trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of T-84 cells. Polarized T-84 cells exposed to 12.8 µM of sodium arsenite from the basolateral side showed a marked reduction in TEER. Cytotoxicity of sodium arsenite, as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), was increased when cells were exposed via the basolateral side. The mRNA expression of genes related to cell junctions in T-84 cells was analyzed after exposure with sodium arsenite for 72 h. Changes in TEER correlated with mRNA expression of focal-adhesion-, tight-junction- and gap-junction-related genes (upregulation of Jam2, Itgb3 and Notch4 genes and downregulation of Cldn2, Cldn3, Gjb1, and Gjb2). Overall, exposure to sodium arsenite from the basolateral side was found to have a differential effect on monolayer permeability and on cell-junction-related genes as compared to apical exposure. Most importantly, this study established a preclinical human-relevant in vitro translational model to assess the changes in permeability and cytotoxicity during exposure, mimicking oral or intravenous routes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hordyjewska, Anna</author><author>Prendecka-Wrobel, Monika</author><author>Kurach, Łukasz</author><author>Horecka, Anna</author><author>Olszewska, Anna</author><author>Pigon-Zajac, Dominika</author><author>Malecka-Massalska, Teresa</author><author>Kurzepa, Jacek</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antiproliferative Properties of Triterpenoids by ECIS Method — A New Promising Approach in Anticancer Studies ?</title><secondary-title>Molecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules</full-title></periodical><pages>3150</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>anticancer properties</keyword><keyword>antitumor activity</keyword><keyword>betulin</keyword><keyword>betulinic acid</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules27103150</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Antiproliferative Properties of Triterpenoids by ECIS Method—A New Promising Approach in Anticancer Studies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27103150</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Proliferation</label><abstract>Electric cell–substrate impedance sensing is an advanced in vitro impedance measuring system which uses alternating current to determine behavior of cells in physiological conditions. In this study, we used the abovementioned method for checking the anticancer activities of betulin and betulinic acid, which are some of the most commonly found triterpenes in nature. In our experiment, the threshold concentrations of betulin required to elicit antiproliferative effects, verified by MTT and LDH release methods, were 7.8 µM for breast cancer (T47D), 9.5 µM for lung carcinoma (A549), and 21.3 µM for normal epithelial cells (Vero). The ECIS results revealed the great potential of betulin and betulinic acid’s antitumor properties and their maintenance of cytotoxic substances to the breast cancer T47D line. Moreover, both substances showed a negligible toxic effect on healthy epithelial cells (Vero). Our investigation showed that the ECIS method is a proper alternative to the currently used assay for testing in vitro anticancer activity of compounds, and that it should thus be introduced in cellular routine research. It is also a valuable tool for live-monitoring changes in the morphology and physiology of cells, which translates into the accurate development of anticancer therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Putman, Ashley K</author><author>Sordillo, Lorraine M</author><author>Contreras, G Andres</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Link Between 15-F 2t -Isoprostane Activity and Acute Bovine Endothelial Inflammation Remains Elusive</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</full-title></periodical><pages>873544</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>April</issue><keywords><keyword>dairy cattle</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>isoprostane</keyword><keyword>oxidative stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2022.873544</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Link Between 15-F2t-Isoprostane Activity and Acute Bovine Endothelial Inflammation Remains Elusive.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffvets.2022.873544</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Modern dairy cattle suffer from increased incidence and severity of mastitis during major physiological transitions of the lactation cycle. Oxidative stress, a condition resulting from inadequate antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is a major underlying component of mastitis pathophysiology. Isoprostanes (IsoP) are molecules derived from cellular lipid membranes upon non-enzymatic interaction with reactive species during inflammation, and are regarded as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of oxidative stress. Changes in IsoP concentrations have been noted during major physiological transitions and diseases such as coliform mastitis in dairy cattle. However, the biological role of IsoP during oxidative stress in dairy cows has not been well-elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the impacts of IsoP on oxidative stress outcomes in a bovine model of acute endothelial inflammation. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC; n = 4) were stimulated with 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without 15-F2t-IsoP to determine how IsoP influence oxidative stress outcomes. Our endothelial inflammation model showed relatively decreased reactive metabolites and increased barrier integrity in cells treated with both the agonist and IsoP compared to agonist treatment alone. However, IsoP do not appear to affect oxidative stress outcomes during acute inflammation. Understanding the effect of IsoP on BAEC is an early step in elucidating how IsoP impact dairy cows during times of oxidative stress in the context of acute clinical mastitis. Future studies should define the optimal dosing and treatment timing of IsoP to maximize their cytoprotective potential during acute inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Lushun</author><author>Cheng, Shuzhen</author><author>Sol, Wendy M.P.J.</author><author>van der Velden, Anouk I.M.</author><author>Vink, Hans</author><author>Rabelink, Ton J.</author><author>van den Berg, Bernard M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heparan sulfate mimetic fucoidan restores the endothelial glycocalyx and protects against dysfunction induced by serum of COVID-19 patients on ICU</title><secondary-title>ERJ Open Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ERJ Open Research</full-title></periodical><pages>00652-2021</pages><issue>March</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/23120541.00652-2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Heparan sulfate mimetic fucoidan restores the endothelial glycocalyx and protects against dysfunction induced by serum of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00652-2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;Modeling;Virology</label><abstract>Accumulating evidence proves that endothelial dysfunction is involved in COVID-19 progression. We previously demonstrated that the endothelial surface glycocalyx has a critical role in maintenance of vascular integrity. Here we hypothesised that serum factors of severe COVID-19 patients affect the glycocalyx and result into endothelial dysfunction.We included blood samples of 32 COVID-19 hospitalised patients at the Leiden University Medical Center: of which 26 from intensive care unit (ICU), 6 non-ICU, 18 convalescent samples 6 weeks after hospital discharge, and of 12 age-matched healthy donors (control) during the first period of the outbreak. First, we determined endothelial (angiopoietin 2, ANG2) and glycocalyx degradation (soluble thrombomodulin, sTM and syndecan-1, sSDC1) markers in plasma.In plasma of COVID-19 patients, circulating ANG2 and sTM were elevated in patients on the ICU. Primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and human glomerular microvascular ECs (GEnCs) cultures in the presence of these sera led to EC glycocalyx degradation, barrier disruption, inflammation and increased coagulation on the endothelial surface, significantly different compared to healthy control and non-ICU patient sera. These changes all could be restored in the presence of fucoidan.In conclusion, our data highlight the link between endothelial glycocalyx degradation, barrier failure and induction of a procoagulant surface in COVID-19 patients on ICU which could be targeted earlier in disease by the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hung, Yu-han</author><author>Chiu, Wei-chih</author><author>Fuh, Shyh-rong</author><author>Lai, Yi-ting</author><author>Tung, Tse-hua</author><author>Huang, Chun-chung</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECIS Based Electric Fence Method for Measurement of Human Keratinocyte Migration on Different Substrates</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>ef</keyword><keyword>electric fence</keyword><keyword>wound healing assays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios12050293</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ECIS Based Electric Fence Method for Measurement of Human.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12050293</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) is an impedance-based, real-time, and label-free measuring system for monitoring cellular activities in tissue culture. Previously, ECIS wound healing assay has been used to wound cells with high electric current and monitor the subsequent cell migration. In this study, we applied ECIS electric fence (EF) method, an alternative to electrical wounding, to assess the effects of different surface coatings on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) migration. The EF prevents inoculated cells from attaching or migrating to the fenced electrode surface while maintaining the integrity of the surface coating. After the EF is turned off, cells migrate into the cell-free area, and the increase in measured impedance is monitored. We cultured HaCaT cells on gold electrodes without coating or coated with poly-L-lysin (PLL), poly-D-lysine (PDL), or type-I collagen. We quantified migration rates according to the different slopes in the impedance time series. It was observed that either poly-L-lysine (PLL) or poly-D-lysine (PDL) limits cell adhesion and migration rates. Furthermore, the surface charge of the coated substrate in the culture condition positively correlates with the cell adhesion and migration process. Our results indicate that the EF method is useful for determining cell migration rates on specific surface coatings.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Cui</author><author>Yan, Xiangji</author><author>Zhang, Yujie</author><author>Yang, Mei</author><author>Ma, Yana</author><author>Zhang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Xu, Qiuran</author><author>Tu, Kangsheng</author><author>Zhang, Mingzhen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oral administration of turmeric ‑ derived exosome ‑ like nanovesicles with anti ‑ inflammatory and pro ‑ resolving bioactions for murine colitis therapy</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nanobiotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nanobiotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>206</issue><keywords><keyword>NF-κB pathway</keyword><keyword>Nanotherapeutics</keyword><keyword>Oral administration</keyword><keyword>Turmeric-derived nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Ulcerative colitis</keyword><keyword>nanotherapeutics</keyword><keyword>nf-κb pathway</keyword><keyword>oral administration</keyword><keyword>turmeric-derived nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>ulcerative colitis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12951-022-01421-w</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Oral administration of turmeric-derived exosome-like nanovesicles with anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving bioactions for murine colitis therapy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-022-01421-w</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by diffuse inflammation of the colonic mucosa and a relapsing and remitting course. The current therapeutics are only modestly effective and carry risks for unacceptable adverse events, and thus more effective approaches to treat UC is clinically needed. Results For this purpose, turmeric-derived nanoparticles with a specific population (TDNPs 2) were characterized, and their targeting ability and therapeutic effects against colitis were investigated systematically. The hydrodynamic size of TDNPs 2 was around 178 nm, and the zeta potential was negative (− 21.7 mV). Mass spectrometry identified TDNPs 2 containing high levels of lipids and proteins. Notably, curcumin, the bioactive constituent of turmeric, was evidenced in TDNPs 2. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammation, TDNPs 2 showed excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In mice colitis models, we demonstrated that orally administrated of TDNPs 2 could ameliorate mice colitis and accelerate colitis resolution via regulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and antioxidant gene, HO-1. Results obtained from transgenic mice with NF-κB-RE-Luc indicated that TDNPs 2-mediated inactivation of the NF-κB pathway might partially contribute to the protective effect of these particles against colitis. Conclusion Our results suggest that TDNPs 2 from edible turmeric represent a novel, natural colon-targeting therapeutics that may prevent colitis and promote wound repair in colitis while outperforming artificial nanoparticles in terms of low toxicity and ease of large-scale production.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bhattarai, Susmita</author><author>Sharma, Sudha</author><author>Subedi, Utsab</author><author>Ara, Hosne</author><author>Shum, Alika</author><author>Milena, Murov</author><author>Bhuiyan, Md.

Study of the mechanisms underlying blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and management of the hypoxic stress-induced permeability of the endothelium following reperfusion are both urgently needed for stroke management. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid essential for basic cellular functions, causes unfavorable outcomes during stroke progression. LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX) is regulated in ischemic stroke. We used an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) to measure endothelial permeability. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were obtained using a Seahorse analyzer. AR-2 probe fluorescence assay was used to measure ATX activity. LPA increased endothelial permeability and reduced junctional protein expression in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC). LPA receptor inhibitors Ki16425 and AM095 attenuated the LPA-induced changes in the endothelial permeability and junctional proteins. LPA significantly diminished mitochondrial function in MBMEC. ATX was upregulated (p &lt; 0.05) in brain microvascular endothelial cells under hypoxic reperfusion. ATX activity and permeability were attenuated with the use of an ATX inhibitor in a mouse stroke model. The upregulation of ATX with hypoxic reperfusion leads to LPA production in brain endothelial cells favoring permeability. Inhibition of the ATX–LPA–LPAR axis could be therapeutically targeted in stroke to achieve better outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morsing, Sofia K.

Known risks for ARDS include severe sepsis, SARS‐CoV‐2, gram‐negative bacteria, trauma, pancreatitis, and blood transfusion. During ARDS, blood fluids and inflammatory cells enter the alveoli, preventing oxygen exchange from air into blood vessels. Reduced pulmonary endothelial barrier function, resulting in leakage of plasma from blood vessels, is one of the major determinants in ARDS. It is, however, unknown why systemic inflammation particularly targets the pulmonary endothelium, as endothelial cells (ECs) line all vessels in the vascular system of the body. In this study, we examined ECs of pulmonary, umbilical, renal, pancreatic, and cardiac origin for upregulation of adhesion molecules, ability to facilitate neutrophil (PMN) trans‐endothelial migration (TEM) and for endothelial barrier function, in response to the gram‐negative bacterial endotoxin LPS. Interestingly, we found that upon LPS stimulation, pulmonary ECs showed increased levels of adhesion molecules, facilitated more PMN‐TEM and significantly perturbed the endothelial barrier, compared to other types of ECs. These observations could partly be explained by a higher expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM‐1 on the pulmonary endothelial surface compared to other ECs. Moreover, we identified an increased expression of Cadherin‐13 in pulmonary ECs, for which we demonstrated that it aids PMN‐TEM in pulmonary ECs stimulated with LPS. We conclude that pulmonary ECs are uniquely sensitive to LPS, and intrinsically different, compared to ECs from other vascular beds. This may add to our understanding of the development of ARDS upon systemic inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>El-tanani, Shaimaa</author><author>Yumnamcha, Thangal</author><author>Singh, Lalit Pukhrambam</author><author>Ibrahim, Ahmed S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Effects of Cytopathic Hypoxia on Human Retinal Endothelial Cellular Behavior : Implication for Ischemic Retinopathies</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>capacitance</keyword><keyword>cocl 2</keyword><keyword>cytopathic hypoxia</keyword><keyword>ecis modeling</keyword><keyword>hrecs</keyword><keyword>human retinal endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>ischemic retinopathies</keyword><keyword>r b resistance</keyword><keyword>seahorse technology</keyword><keyword>α resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23084274</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Differential Effects of Cytopathic Hypoxia on Human Retinal Endothelial Cellular Behavior Implication for Ischemic Retinopathies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23084274</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>Loss of barrier integrity of retinal endothelial cells (RECs) is an early feature of ischemic retinopathies (IRs), but the triggering mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have reported mitochondrial dysfunction in several forms of IRs, which creates a cytopathic hypoxic environment where cells cannot use oxygen for energy production. Nonetheless, the contribution of cytopathic hypoxia to the REC barrier failure has not been fully explored. In this study, we dissect in-depth the role of cytopathic hypoxia in impairing the barrier function of REC. We employed the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology to monitor in real-time the impedance (Z) and hence the barrier functionality of human RECs (HRECs) under cytopathic hypoxia-inducing agent, Cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2). Furthermore, data were deconvoluted to test the effect of cytopathic hypoxia on the three key components of barrier integrity; Rb (paracellular resistance between HRECs), α (basolateral adhesion between HRECs and the extracellular matrix), and Cm (HREC membrane capacitance). Our results showed that CoCl2 decreased the Z of HRECs dose-dependently. Specifically, the Rb parameter of the HREC barrier was the parameter that declined first and most significantly by the cytopathic hypoxia-inducing agent and in a dose-dependent manner. When Rb began to fall to its minimum, other parameters of the HREC barrier, including α and Cm, were unaffected. Interestingly, the compromised effect of cytopathic hypoxia on Rb was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction but not with cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate distinguishable dielectric properties of HRECs under cytopathic hypoxia in which the paracellular junction between adjacent HRECs is the most vulnerable target. Such selective behavior could be utilized to screen agents or genes that maintain and strengthen the assembly of HRECs tight junction complex</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Powrozek, Tomasz</author><author>Pgion-Zajac, Dominika</author><author>Mazurek, Marcin</author><author>Otieno, Michael Ochieng</author><author>Rahnama-Hezavah, Mansur</author><author>Malecka-Massalska, Teresa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TNF- α Induced Myotube Atrophy in C2C12 Cell Line Uncovers Putative Inflammatory-Related lncRNAs Mediating Muscle Wasting</title><secondary-title>International journal of molecular medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of molecular medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>3878</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>TNF-α</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>lncRNA</keyword><keyword>muscle atrophy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23073878</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TNF-α Induced Myotube Atrophy in C2C12 Cell Line Uncovers Putative Inflammatory-Related lncRNAs Mediating Muscle Wasting.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23073878</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Background: Muscle atrophy is a complex catabolic condition developing under different inflammatory-related systemic diseases resulting in wasting of muscle tissue. While the knowledge of the molecular background of muscle atrophy has developed in recent years, how the atrophic conditions affect the long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) machinery and the exact participation of the latter in the mediation of muscle loss are still unknown. The purpose of the study was to assess how inflammatory condition developing under the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment affects the lncRNAs’ expression in a mouse skeletal muscle cell line. Materials and method: A C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line was treated with TNF-α to develop atrophy, and inflammatory-related lncRNAs mediating muscle loss were identified. Bioinformatics was used to validate and analyze the discovered lncRNAs. The differences in their expression under different TNF-α concentrations and treatment times were investigated. Results: Five lncRNAs were identified in a discovery set as atrophy related and then validated. Three lncRNAs, Gm4117, Ccdc41os1, and 5830418P13Rik, were selected as being significant for inflammatory-related myotube atrophy. Dynamics changes in the expression of lncRNAs depended on both TNF-α concentration and treatment time. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the mRNA and miRNA target for selected lncRNAs and their putative involvement in the molecular processes related to muscle atrophy. Conclusions: The inflammatory condition developing in the myotube under the TNF-α treatment affects the alteration of lncRNAs’ expression pattern. Experimental and bioinformatics testing suggested the prospective role of lncRNAs in the mediation of muscle loss under an inflammatory state.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Müller, Martin Bernhard</author><author>Hübner, Max</author><author>Li, Lei</author><author>Tomasi, Stephanie</author><author>Ließke, Valena</author><author>Ef, David</author><author>Hirschberger, Simon</author><author>Pogoda, Kristin</author><author>Sperandio, Markus</author><author>Kreth, Simone</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-Crossing Functional Network Driven by microRNA-125a Regulates Endothelial Permeability and Monocyte Trafficking in Acute In flammation</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>March</issue><keywords><keyword>cking</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>immune cell traf fi</keyword><keyword>in fl ammation</keyword><keyword>microrna network</keyword><keyword>monocytes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2022.826047</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cell-Crossing Functional Network Driven by microRNA-125a Regulates Endothelial Permeability and Monocyte Trafficking in Acute Inflammation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2022.826047</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Opening of the endothelial barrier and targeted infiltration of leukocytes into the affected tissue are hallmarks of the inflammatory response. The molecular mechanisms regulating these processes are still widely elusive. In this study, we elucidate a novel regulatory network, in which miR-125a acts as a central hub that regulates and synchronizes both endothelial barrier permeability and monocyte migration. We found that inflammatory stimulation of endothelial cells induces miR-125a expression, which consecutively inhibits a regulatory network consisting of the two adhesion molecules VE-Cadherin (CDH5) and Claudin-5 (CLDN5), two regulatory tyrosine phosphatases (PTPN1, PPP1CA) and the transcription factor ETS1 eventually leading to the opening of the endothelial barrier. Moreover, under the influence of miR-125a, endothelial expression of the chemokine CCL2, the most predominant ligand for the monocytic chemokine receptor CCR2, was strongly enhanced. In monocytes, on the other hand, we detected markedly repressed expression levels of miR-125a upon inflammatory stimulation. This induced a forced expression of its direct target gene CCR2, entailing a strongly enhanced monocyte chemotaxis. Collectively, cell-type-specific differential expression of miR-125a forms a synergistic functional network controlling monocyte trafficking across the endothelial barrier towards the site of inflammation. In addition to the known mechanism of miRNAs being shuttled between cells via extracellular vesicles, our study uncovers a novel dimension of miRNA function: One miRNA, although disparately regulated in the cells involved, directs a biologic process in a synergistic and mutually reinforcing manner. These findings provide important new insights into the regulation of the inflammatory cascade and may be of great use for future clinical applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colunga Biancatelli, Ruben Manuel Luciano</author><author>Solopov, Pavel A.</author><author>Gregory, Betsy</author><author>Khodour, Yara</author><author>Catravas, John D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HSP90 Inhibitors Modulate SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Subunit 1-Induced Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Activation and Barrier Dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Physiology</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>March</issue><keywords><keyword>AT13387</keyword><keyword>AUY-922</keyword><keyword>HSP90 inhibitors</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>auy-922</keyword><keyword>endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>heat shock proteins</keyword><keyword>hsp90 inhibitors</keyword><keyword>sars-cov-2</keyword><keyword>spike protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphys.2022.812199</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HSP90 Inhibitors Modulate SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Subunit 1-Induced Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Activation and Barrier Dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphys.2022.812199</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 5 million deaths worldwide. Multiple reports indicate that the endothelium is involved during SARS-Cov-2-related disease (COVID-19). Indeed, COVID-19 patients display increased thrombophilia with arterial and venous embolism and lung microcapillary thrombotic disease as major determinants of deaths. The pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 is not completely understood. We have investigated the role of subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1SP) in eliciting endothelial barrier dysfunction, characterized dose and time relationships, and tested the hypothesis that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors would prevent and repair such injury. S1SP activated (phosphorylated) IKBα, STAT3, and AKT and reduced the expression of intercellular junctional proteins, occludin, and VE-cadherin. HSP90 inhibitors (AT13387 and AUY-922) prevented endothelial barrier dysfunction and hyperpermeability and reduced IKBα and AKT activation. These two inhibitors also blocked S1SP-mediated barrier dysfunction and loss of VE-cadherin. These data suggest that spike protein subunit 1 can elicit, by itself, direct injury to the endothelium and suggest a role of HSP90 inhibitors in preserving endothelial functionality.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarafdar, Anuradha</author><author>Wolska, Nina</author><author>Krisp, Christoph</author><author>Schlüter, Hartmut</author><author>Pula, Giordano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The amyloid peptide β disrupts intercellular junctions and increases endothelial permeability in a NADPH oxidase 1-dependent manner</title><secondary-title>Redox Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Redox Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>102287</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>December 2021</issue><keywords><keyword>Alzheimer</keyword><keyword>Endothelial</keyword><keyword>NADPH oxidase</keyword><keyword>Neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.redox.2022.102287</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The amyloid peptide β disrupts intercellular junctions and increases endothelial permeability in a NADPH oxidase 1-dependent manner.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2022.102287</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is associated with the accumulation of amyloid peptide β in the brain parenchyma. Vascular damage and microvascular thrombosis contribute to the neuronal degeneration and the loss of brain function typical of this disease. In this study, we utilised a murine model of Alzheimer's disease to evaluate the neurovascular effects of this disease. Upon detection of an increase in the phosphorylation of the endothelial surface receptor VE-cadherin, we focused our attention on endothelial cells and utilised two types of human endothelial cells cultured in vitro: 1) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and 2) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Using an electrical current impedance system (ECIS) and FITC-albumin permeability assays, we discovered that the treatment of human endothelial cells with amyloid peptide β causes a loss in their barrier function, which is oxidative stress-dependent and similarly to our observation in mouse brain associates with VE-cadherin phosphorylation. The activation of the superoxide anion-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 1 is responsible for the oxidative stress that leads to the disruption of barrier function in human endothelial cells in vitro. In summary, we have identified a novel molecular mechanism explaining how the accumulation of amyloid peptide β in the brain parenchyma may induce the loss of neurovascular barrier function, which has been observed in patients. Neurovascular leakiness plays an important role in brain inflammation and neuronal degeneration driving the progression of the Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study provides a novel and promising target for the development of a pharmacological treatment to protect neurovascular function and reduce the progression of the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ochoa, Carmen A.</author><author>Nissen, Claire</author><author>Mosley, Deanna D.</author><author>Bauer, Christopher D.</author><author>Jordan, Destiny</author><author>Bailey, Kristina L.</author><author>Wyatt, Todd A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aldehyde trapping by ADX-102 is protective against cigarette smoke and alcohol-mediated lung cell injury</title><secondary-title>Biomolecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomolecules</full-title></periodical><pages>393</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>AUD</keyword><keyword>acetaldehyde</keyword><keyword>alcohol</keyword><keyword>cigarette</keyword><keyword>lung</keyword><keyword>malondialdehyde</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biom12030393</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Aldehyde Trapping by ADX-102 Is Protective against Cigarette Smoke and Alcohol Mediated Lung Cell Injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiom12030393</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Most individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorders smoke cigarettes. Large concentrations of malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde are found in lungs co-exposed to cigarette smoke and alcohol. Aldehydes directly injure lungs and form aldehyde protein adducts, impacting epithelial functions. Recently, 2-(3-Amino-6-chloroquinolin-2-yl)propan-2-ol (ADX-102) was developed as an aldehyde-trapping drug. We hypothesized that aldehyde-trapping compounds are protective against lung injury derived from cigarette smoke and alcohol co-exposure. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated mouse ciliated tracheal epithelial cells with 0–100 µM of ADX-102 followed by co-exposure to 5% cigarette smoke extract and 50 mM of ethanol. Pretreatment with ADX-102 dose-dependently protected against smoke and alcohol induced cilia-slowing, decreases in bronchial epithelial cell wound repair, decreases in epithelial monolayer resistance, and the formation of MAA adducts. ADX-102 concentrations up to 100 µM showed no cellular toxicity. As protein kinase C (PKC) activation is a known mechanism for slowing cilia and wound repair, we examined the effects of ADX-102 on smoke and alcohol induced PKC epsilon activity. ADX-102 prevented early (3 h) activation and late (24 h) autodownregulation of PKC epsilon in response to smoke and alcohol. These data suggest that reactive aldehydes generated from cigarette smoke and alcohol metabolism may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention to reduce lung injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biancatelli, Ruben M L Colunga</author><author>Solopov, Pavel</author><author>Dimitropoulou, Christiana</author><author>Gregory, Betsy</author><author>Day, Tierney</author><author>Catravas, John D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitor, AT13387, Protects the Alveolo-Capillary Barrier and Prevents HCl-Induced Chronic Lung Injury and Pulmonary Fibrosis</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>AT13387</keyword><keyword>HCl exposure</keyword><keyword>HSP90 inhibitors</keyword><keyword>endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>heat shock proteins</keyword><keyword>pulmonary fibrosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells11061046</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitor, AT13387, Protects the Alveolo-Capillary Barrier and Prevents HCl-Induced Chronic Lung Injury and Pulmonary Fibrosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells11061046</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Hydrochloric acid (HCl) exposure causes asthma-like conditions, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that regulates multiple cellular processes. HSP90 inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials for cancer and are also being studied in various pre-clinical settings for their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Here we investigated the ability of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor AT13387 to prevent chronic lung injury induced by exposure to HCl in vivo and its protective role in the endothelial barrier in vitro. We instilled C57Bl/6J mice with 0.1N HCl (2 µL/g body weight, intratracheally) and after 24 h began treatment with vehicle or AT13387 (10 or 15 mg/kg, SC), administered 3×/week; we analyzed histological, functional, and molecular markers 30 days after HCl. In addition, we monitored transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and protein expression in a monolayer of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) exposed to HCl (0.02 N) and treated with vehicle or AT13387 (2 µM). HCl provoked persistent alveolar inflammation; activation of profibrotic pathways (MAPK/ERK, HSP90); increased deposition of collagen, fibronectin and elastin; histological evidence of fibrosis; and a decline in lung function reflected in a downward shift in pressure–volume curves, increased respiratory system resistance (Rrs), elastance (Ers), tissue damping (G), and hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Treatment with 15 mg/kg AT13387reduced alveolar inflammation, fibrosis, and NLRP3 staining; blocked activation of ERK and HSP90; and attenuated the deposition of collagen and the development of chronic lung injury and airway hyperreactivity. In vitro, AT13387 prevented HCl-induced loss of barrier function and AKT, ERK, and ROCK1 activation, and restored HSP70 and cofilin expression. The HSP90 inhibitor, AT13387, represents a promising drug candidate for chronic lung injury that can be administered subcutaneously in the field, and at low, non-toxic doses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smeda, Marta</author><author>Stojak, Marta</author><author>Przyborowski, Kamil</author><author>Sternak, Magdalena</author><author>Suraj-Prazmowska, Joanna</author><author>Kus, Kamil</author><author>Derszniak, Katarzyna</author><author>Jasztal, Agnieszka</author><author>Kij, Agnieszka</author><author>Kurpinska, Anna</author><author>Kieronska-Rudek, Anna</author><author>Wojnar-Lason, Kamila</author><author>Buczek, Elzbieta</author><author>Mohaissen, Tasnim</author><author>Chlopicki, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran Compromises Pulmonary Endothelial Integrity in a Murine Model of Breast Cancer Metastasis to the Lungs; the Role of Platelets and Inflammation-Associated Haemostasis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>dabigatran</keyword><keyword>frontiers in pharmacology</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>platelets</keyword><keyword>pulmonary metastasis</keyword><keyword>thrombin</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphar.2022.834472</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Direct Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran Compromises Pulmonary Endothelial Integrity in a Murine Model of Breast Cancer Metastasis to the Lungs; the Role of Platelets and Inflammation-Associated Haemostasis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphar.2022.834472</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Activation of the coagulation cascade favours metastatic spread, but antithrombotic therapy might also have detrimental effects on cancer progression. In this study, we characterized the effects of dabigatran, a direct reversible thrombin inhibitor, on the pulmonary endothelial barrier and metastatic spread in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis. Dabigatran etexilate (100 mg kg −1 ) was administered to mice twice daily by oral gavage. Pulmonary metastasis, pulmonary endothelium permeability in vivo , and platelet reactivity were evaluated after intravenous injection of 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. The effect of dabigatran on platelet-dependent protection of pulmonary endothelial barrier in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus was also verified in vitro using human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HLMVEC) cultures. Dabigatran-treated mice harbored more metastases in their lungs and displayed increased pulmonary endothelium permeability after cancer cell injection. It was not associated with altered lung fibrin deposition, changes in INFγ, or complement activation. In the in vitro model of the pulmonary endothelial barrier, dabigatran inhibited platelet-mediated protection of pulmonary endothelium. In a murine model of breast cancer metastasis, dabigatran treatment promoted pulmonary metastasis by the inhibition of platelet-dependent protection of pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bogunovic, Natalija</author><author>Rombouts, Karlijn B</author><author>Yeung, Kak Khee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolation of Primary Patient-specific Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells and Semiquantitative Real-time Contraction Measurements In Vitro</title><secondary-title>JoVE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JoVE</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/63122</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3791/63122</url></web-urls></urls><label>Contractility</label><abstract>Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the predominant cell type in the aortic media. Their contractile machinery is important for the transmission of force in the aorta and regulates vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Mutations in genes encoding for the SMC contractile apparatus proteins are associated with aortic diseases, such as thoracic aortic aneurysms. Measuring SMC contraction in vitro is challenging, especially in a high-throughput manner, which is essential for screening patient material. Currently available methods are not suitable for this purpose. This paper presents a novel method based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). First, an explant protocol is described to isolate patient-specific human primary SMCs from aortic biopsies and patient-specific human primary dermal fibroblasts for the study of aortic aneurysms. Next, a detailed description of a new contraction method is given to measure the contractile response of these cells, including the subsequent analysis and suggestion for comparing different groups. This method can be used to study the contraction of adherent cells in the context of translational (cardiovascular) studies and patient and drug screening studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dosunmu-Ogunbi, Atinuke</author><author>Yuan, Shuai</author><author>Shiwarski, Daniel J</author><author>Tashman, Joshua W</author><author>Reynolds, Michael</author><author>Feinberg, Adam</author><author>Novelli, Enrico M</author><author>Shiva, Sruti</author><author>Straub, Adam C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial Superoxide Dismutase 2 is Decreased in Sickle Cell Disease and Regulates Fibronectin Processing</title><secondary-title>Function</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Function</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>October 2021</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>fibronectin</keyword><keyword>mitochondria</keyword><keyword>reactive oxygen species</keyword><keyword>redox</keyword><keyword>sickle cell</keyword><keyword>sod2</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/function/zqac005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial superoxide dismutase 2 is decreased in sickle cell disease and regulates fibronectin processing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Ffunction%2Fzqac005</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic red blood cell disorder characterized by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a concordant reduction in antioxidant capacity in the endothelium. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is a mitochondrial-localized enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. Decreased peripheral blood expression of SOD2 is correlated with increased hemolysis and cardiomyopathy in SCD. Here, we report for the first time that endothelial cells exhibit reduced SOD2 protein expression in the pulmonary endothelium of SCD patients. To investigate the impact of decreased SOD2 expression in the endothelium, SOD2 was knocked down in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVECs). We found that SOD2 deficiency in hPMVECs results in endothelial cell dysfunction, including reduced cellular adhesion, diminished migration, integrin protein dysregulation, and disruption of permeability. Furthermore, we uncover that SOD2 mediates changes in endothelial cell function via processing of fibronectin through its inability to facilitate dimerization. These results demonstrate that endothelial cells are deficient in SOD2 expression in SCD patients and suggest a novel pathway for SOD2 in regulating fibronectin processing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Weiguo</author><author>Gard, Jamie M.

In this study, we report increased endothelial cell (EC) expression specifically of ITGB4E, an ITGB4 mRNA splice variant, by simvastatin with effects on EC protein expression and inflammatory responses. In initial experiments, human pulmonary artery ECs were treated using simvastatin (5 μM, 24 h) prior to immunoprecipitation of integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6), which associates with ITGB4, and Western blotting for full-length ITGB4 and ITGB4E, uniquely characterized by a truncated 114 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. These experiments confirmed a significant increase in both full-length ITGB4 and ITGB4E. To investigate the effects of increased ITGB4E expression alone, ECs were transfected with ITGB4E or control vector, and cells were seeded in wells containing Matrigel to assess effects on angiogenesis or used for scratch assay to assess migration. Decreased angiogenesis and migration were observed in ITGB4E transfected ECs compared with controls. In separate experiments, PCR and Western blots from transfected cells demonstrated significant changes in EC protein expression associated with increased ITGB4E, including marked decreases in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) as well as increased expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin along with increased expression of the Slug and Snail transcription factors that promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). We, then, investigated the functional effects of ITGB4E overexpression on EC inflammatory responses and observed a significant attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, including decreased phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as reduced inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), expressed in the media of EC after either LPS or excessive cyclic stretch (CS). Finally, EC expression-increased ITGB4E demonstrated decreased barrier disruption induced by thrombin as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. Our data support distinct EC phenotypic changes induced by ITGB4E that are also associated with an attenuation of cellular inflammatory responses. These findings implicate ITGB4E upregulation as an important mediator of lung EC protection by statins and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for patients with or at risk for acute lung injury (ALI).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Vries, M.</author><author>Nwozor, K.

We previously identified a gene signature for ageing in the human lung which included genes involved in apical and tight junction assembly, suggesting a role for airway epithelial barrier dysfunction with ageing. Aim To investigate the association between genes involved in epithelial barrier function and age both in silico and in vitro in the airway epithelium. Methods We curated a gene signature of 274 genes for epithelial barrier function and tested the association with age in two independent cohorts of bronchial brushings from healthy individuals with no respiratory disease, using linear regression analysis (FDR &lt; 0.05). Protein–protein interactions were identified using STRING©. The barrier function of primary bronchial epithelial cells at air–liquid interface and CRISPR–Cas9-induced knock-down of target genes in human bronchial 16HBE14o-cells was assessed using Trans epithelial resistance (TER) measurement and Electric cell-surface impedance sensing (ECIS) respectively. Results In bronchial brushings, we found 55 genes involved in barrier function to be significantly associated with age (FDR &lt; 0.05). EPCAM was most significantly associated with increasing age and TRPV4 with decreasing age. Protein interaction analysis identified CDH1, that was negatively associated with higher age, as potential key regulator of age-related epithelial barrier function changes. In vitro, barrier function was lower in bronchial epithelial cells from subjects &gt; 45 years of age and significantly reduced in CDH1-deficient 16HBE14o-cells. Conclusion The significant association between genes involved in epithelial barrier function and age, supported by functional studies in vitro, suggest a role for epithelial barrier dysfunction in age-related airway disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kubra, Khadeja-Tul</author><author>Uddin, Mohammad A.</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tunicamycin Protects against LPS-Induced Lung Injury</title><secondary-title>Pharmaceuticals</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmaceuticals</full-title></periodical><pages>134</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>acute respiratory distress syndrome</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ph15020134</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tunicamycin Protects against LPS-Induced Lung Injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fph15020134</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>The pulmonary endothelium is a dynamic semipermeable barrier that orchestrates tissue-fluid homeostasis; regulating physiological and immunological responses. Endothelial abnormalities are caused by inflammatory stimuli interacting with intracellular messengers to remodel cytoskeletal junctions and adhesion proteins. Those phenomena are associated with sepsis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The molecular processes beyond those responses are the main interest of our group. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly conserved molecular pathway resolving protein-folding defects to counteract cellular threats. An emerging body of evidence suggests that UPR is a promising target against lung and cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we reveal that Tunicamycin (TM) (UPR inducer) protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury. The barrier function of the inflamed endothelium was evaluated in vitro (transendothelial and paracellular permeability); as well as in mice exposed to TM after LPS. Our study demonstrates that TM supports vascular barrier function by modulating actomyosin remodeling. Moreover, it reduces the internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), enhancing endothelial integrity. We suggest that UPR activation may deliver novel therapeutic opportunities in diseases related to endothelial dysregulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Telford, Emily A</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Owen, Sioned</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Harrison, Gregory M</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Martin, Tracey A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1 ( HAVcr-1 ) Initiates Prostate Cancer Progression in Human Cells via Hepatocyte Growth Factor ( HGF ) -Induced Changes in Junctional Integrity</title><secondary-title>Biomolecules</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomolecules</full-title></periodical><pages>338</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>havcr-1</keyword><keyword>junctions</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>migration</keyword><keyword>prognosis</keyword><keyword>prostate cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biom12020338</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1 (HAVcr-1) Initiates Prostate Cancer Progression in Human Cells via Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)-Induced Changes in Junctional Integrity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiom12020338</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Modeling;Virology;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background: HAVcR-1 has been linked to cancer aetiology and may regulate junctional complexes, with its role in prostate cancer still unexplored. This study aims to investigate the expression of HAVcR-1 in prostate cancer samples and the exploration of the cellular/molecular impact of HAVcR-1. Methods: Levels of HAVcR-1 ectodomain in the serum of prostate cancer patients were compared to healthy controls, and assessed as the total protein and gene expression of HAVcR-1 and tissues sections. The manipulation of HAVcR-1 levels within prostate cancer cell lines determined changes in cell behaviour using in vitro cell models and barrier function assays. Protein/phosphoprotein levels were assessed using Western blotting. Results: Levels of HAVcR-1 ectodomain from serum were decreased in patients with prostate cancer. Ectodomain levels correlated with the Gleason score. Histologically, the total protein/gene expression of HAVcR-1 was overexpressed in prostate cancer. The overexpression of HAVcR-1 in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in key changes in cell behaviour and the phosphorylation of β-catenin with a concurrent decrease in membranous E-cadherin, increased nuclear β-catenin and increased cyclin D1 protein expression, which were associated with HGF-promoted changes in the barrier function. Conclusions: HAVcR-1 expression and ectodomain release coincides with the presence of prostate cancer; thus, indicating HAVcR-1 as a potential biomarker to aid in diagnostics, and implicating HAVcR-1 in the dysregulation of junctional complexes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lindenau, Kristen L</author><author>Barr, Jeffrey L</author><author>Higgins, Christopher R</author><author>Sporici, Kevin T</author><author>Brailoiu, Eugen</author><author>Brailoiu, Gabriela C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption Mediated by FFA1 Receptor — Evidence Using Miniscope</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2258</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BBB</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>brain microvascular endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>n-3 PUFAs</keyword><keyword>omega-3 fatty acids</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23042258</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption Mediated by FFA1 Receptor—Evidence Using Miniscope.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23042258</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), obtained from diet and dietary supplements, have been tested in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of several diseases. n-3 PUFAs exert their effects by activation of free fatty acid (FFA) receptors.

AMG837, a synthetic FFA1 agonist, produced a dose-dependent decrease in RBMVEC monolayer resistance assessed with Electric Cell–Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS); the effect was attenuated by the FFA1 antagonist, GW1100. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that AMG837 produced a disruption in tight and adherens junction proteins. AMG837 increased Evans Blue content in the rat brain in a dose-dependent manner. Live imaging studies of rat brain microcirculation with miniaturized fluorescence microscopy (miniscope) showed that AMG837 increased extravasation of sodium fluorescein. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FFA1 receptor activation reduced RBMVEC barrier function and produced a transient increase in BBB permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Chen, Jiaqi</author><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Huo, Dong</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meningitic Escherichia coli-Induced Interleukin-17A Facilitates Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption via Inhibiting Proteinase 3/Protease-Activated Receptor 2 Axis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>Escherichia coli meningitis</keyword><keyword>IL-17A</keyword><keyword>PAR-2</keyword><keyword>PRTN3</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>blood?brain barrier</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>escherichia coli meningitis</keyword><keyword>il-17a</keyword><keyword>par-2</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>prtn3</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fncel.2022.814867</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Meningitic Escherichia coli-Induced Interleukin-17A Facilitates Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption via Inhibiting Proteinase 3-Protease-Activated Receptor 2 Axis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffncel.2022.814867</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, among which meningitic Escherichia coli is a common Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium causing meningitis. It can penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB), invoke local inflammatory responses and consequently disrupt the integrity of the BBB. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is recognized as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is released during meningitic E. coli infection. It has been reported that IL-17A is involved in several pathological tissue injuries. However, the function of IL-17A in BBB breakdown remains rarely discussed. Here, our study found that E. coli -induced IL-17A led to the degradation of tight junction proteins (TJs) and adherens junction proteins (AJs) in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) through inhibiting protease proteinase 3 (PRTN3)/protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) axis, thus increasing the permeability of BBB. In summary, this study uncovered the involvement of IL-17A in regulating BBB integrity and proposed a novel regulatory mechanism, which could be potential therapeutic targets of E. coli meningitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bednarek, Radoslaw</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Vitro Methods for Measuring the Permeability of Cell Monolayers</title><secondary-title>Methods and Protocols</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods and Protocols</full-title></periodical><pages>17</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>dysfunction</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>epithelium</keyword><keyword>fluorescent tracer</keyword><keyword>microfluidics</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>transendothelial resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/mps5010017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fmps5010017</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Review;TEER;Theory</label><abstract>Cell monolayers, including endothelial and epithelial cells, play crucial roles in regulating the transport of biomolecules to underlying tissues and structures via intercellular junctions. Moreover, the monolayers form a semipermeable barrier across which leukocyte transmigration is tightly regulated. The inflammatory cytokines can disrupt the epithelial and endothelial permeability, thus the reduced barrier integrity is a hallmark of epithelial and endothelial dysfunction related with numerous pathological conditions, including cancer-related inflammation. Therefore, the assessment of barrier function is critical in in vitro models of barrier-forming tissues. This review summarizes the commercially available in vitro systems used to measure the permeability of cellular monolayers. The presented techniques are separated in two large groups: macromolecular tracer flux assays, and electrical impedance measurement-based permeability assays. The presented techniques are briefly described and compared.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kovacs-kasa, Anita</author><author>Zaied, Abdelrahman A</author><author>Leanhart, Silvia</author><author>Koseoglu, Murat</author><author>Sridhar, Supriya</author><author>Lucas, Rudolf</author><author>Fulton, David J</author><author>Vazquez, Jose A</author><author>Annex, Brian H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Elevated Cytokine Levels in Plasma of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Do Not Contribute to Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial</title><secondary-title>Microbiology Spectrum</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiology Spectrum</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>ACE-2 receptor</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2 plasma</keyword><keyword>antiinflammatory cytokines</keyword><keyword>barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>complements factors</keyword><keyword>cytokine</keyword><keyword>endothelial injury</keyword><keyword>endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>heat inactivation</keyword><keyword>neutralizing antibodies</keyword><keyword>plasma</keyword><keyword>proinflammatory cytokines</keyword><keyword>spike protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>American Society for Microbiology</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/spectrum.01671-21</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Elevated Cytokine Levels in Plasma of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Do Not Contribute to Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Permeability.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1128%2Fspectrum.01671-21</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19</label><abstract>The vascular endothelial injury occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to determine the frequency and type of cytokine elevations and their relationship to endothelial injury induced by plasma from patients with SARS-CoV-2 versus controls. Plasma from eight consecutively enrolled patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was compared to controls. Endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity was evaluated using ECIS (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) on human lung microvascular EC. Plasma from all SARS-CoV-2 but none from controls decreased transendothelial resistance to a greater degree than that produced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), the positive control for the assay. Thrombin, angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), complement factor C3a and C5a, and spike protein increased endothelial permeability, but to a lesser extent and a shorter duration when compared to SARS-CoV-2 plasma. Analysis of Ang2, VEGF, and 15 cytokines measured in plasma revealed striking patient-to-patient variability within the SARS-CoV-2 patients. Pretreatment with thrombin inhibitors, single, or combinations of neutralizing antibodies against cytokines, Ca3 and C5a receptor antagonists, or with ACE2 antibody failed to lessen the SARS-CoV-2 plasma-induced EC permeability. The EC barrier destructive effects of plasma from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were susceptible to heat inactivation. Plasma from patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection uniformly disrupts lung microvascular integrity. No predicted single, or set of, cytokine(s) accounted for the enhanced vascular permeability, although the factor(s) were heat-labile. A still unidentified but potent circulating factor(s) appears to cause the EC disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Jingxia</author><author>Song, Guanzhong</author><author>Shen, Haibo</author><author>Wu, Yiming</author><author>Zhao, Chongqi</author><author>Zhang, Zhuo</author><author>Jiang, Qian</author><author>Li, Xilong</author><author>Ma, Xiaokang</author><author>Tan, Bie</author><author>Yin, Yulong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allicin Improves Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function and Prevents LPS-Induced Barrier Damages of Intestinal Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>IPEC-J2</keyword><keyword>Nrf2</keyword><keyword>allicin</keyword><keyword>intestinal barrier</keyword><keyword>ipec-j2</keyword><keyword>lipopolysaccharide</keyword><keyword>nrf2</keyword><keyword>oxidative damage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2022.847861</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Allicin Improves Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function and Prevents LPS-Induced Barrier Damages of Intestinal Epithelial Cell Monolayers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2022.847861</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Gut barrier disruption is the initial pathogenesis of various diseases. We previously reported that dietary allicin improves tight junction proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum stressed jejunum. However, whether the allicin benefits the gut barrier within mycotoxin or endotoxin exposure is unknown. In the present study, IPEC-J2 cell monolayers within or without deoxynivalenol (DON) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges were employed to investigate the effects of allicin on intestinal barrier function and explore the potential mechanisms. Results clarified that allicin at 2 μg/mL increased the viability, whereas the allicin higher than 10 μg/mL lowered the viability of IPEC-J2 cells via inhibiting cell proliferation. Besides, allicin increased trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER), decreased paracellular permeability, and enhanced ZO-1 integrity of the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers. Finally, allicin supplementation prevented the LPS-induced barrier damages via activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-dependent antioxidant system. In conclusion, the present study strongly confirmed allicin as an effective nutrient to improve intestinal barrier function and prevent bacterial endotoxin-induced barrier damages.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valliere, Cheryl De</author><author>Cosin-Roger, Jesus</author><author>Baebler, Katharina</author><author>Schoepflin, Anja</author><author>Mamie, C</author><author>Mollet, Michelle</author><author>Schuler, Cordelia</author><author>Bengs, Susan</author><author>Lang, Silvia</author><author>Scharl, Michael</author><author>Seuwen, Klaus</author><author>Ruiz, Pedro A</author><author>Hausmann, Martin</author><author>Rogler, Gerhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>pH-Sensing G Protein-Coupled Receptor OGR1 ( GPR68 ) Expression and Activation Increases in Intestinal Inflammation and Fibrosis</title><secondary-title>International journal of molecular sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of molecular sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1419</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>OGR1 (GPR68) expression and function</keyword><keyword>fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>fibrosis</keyword><keyword>inflammatory bowel disease</keyword><keyword>pH-sensing GPCR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23031419</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://pH-Sensing G Protein-Coupled Receptor OGR1 (GPR68) Expression and Activation Increases in Intestinal Inflammation and Fibrosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23031419</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Local extracellular acidification occurs at sites of inflammation. Proton-sensing ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1, also known as GPR68) responds to decreases in extracellular pH. Our previous studies show a role for OGR1 in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation, suggesting a link between tissue pH and immune responses. Additionally, pH-dependent signalling is associated with the progression of intestinal fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate OGR1 expression and OGR1-mediated signalling in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our results show that OGR1 expression significantly increased in patients with IBD compared to non-IBD patients, as demonstrated by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Paired samples from non-inflamed and inflamed intestinal areas of IBD patients showed stronger OGR1 IHC staining in inflamed mucosal segments compared to non-inflamed mucosa. IHC of human surgical samples revealed OGR1 expression in macrophages, granulocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. OGR1-dependent inositol phosphate (IP) production was significantly increased in CD14+ monocytes from IBD patients compared to healthy subjects. Primary human and murine fibroblasts exhibited OGR1-dependent IP formation, RhoA activation, F-actin, and stress fibre formation upon an acidic pH shift. OGR1 expression and signalling increases with IBD disease activity, suggesting an active role of OGR1 in the pathogenesis of IBD.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hamester, Fabienne</author><author>Stürken, Christine</author><author>Saygi, Ceren</author><author>Qi, Minyue</author><author>Legler, Karen</author><author>Gorzelanny, Christian</author><author>Robador, Jos R</author><author>Schmalfeldt, Barbara</author><author>Laakmann, Elena</author><author>Müller, Volkmar</author><author>Witzel, Isabell</author><author>Oliveira-Ferrer, Leticia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insights into the Steps of Breast Cancer – Brain Metastases Development : Tumor Cell Interactions with the Blood-Brain Barrier</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1900</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>2022 by the authors</keyword><keyword>adhesion</keyword><keyword>angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>basel</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>brain metastasis</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>breast cancer molecular subtypes</keyword><keyword>copyright</keyword><keyword>gap junction assembly</keyword><keyword>invasion</keyword><keyword>licensee mdpi</keyword><keyword>switzerland</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23031900</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Insights into the Steps of Breast Cancer–Brain Metastases Development Tumor Cell Interactions with the Blood–Brain Barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23031900</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Brain metastases (BM) represent a growing problem for breast cancer (BC) patients. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong impact of the BC molecular subtype on the incidence of BM development. This study explores the interaction between BC cells of different molecular subtypes and the blood–brain barrier (BBB). We compared the ability of BC cells of different molecular subtypes to overcome several steps (adhesion to the brain endothelium, disruption of the BBB, and invasion through the endothelial layer) during cerebral metastases formation, in vitro as well as in vivo. Further, the impact of these cells on the BBB was deciphered at the molecular level by transcriptome analysis of the triple-negative (TNBC) cells themselves as well as of hBMECs after cocultivation with BC cell secretomes. Compared to luminal BC cells, TNBC cells have a greater ability to influence the BBB in vitro and consequently develop BM in vivo. The brain-seeking subline and parental TNBC cells behaved similarly in terms of adhesion, whereas the first showed a stronger impact on the brain endothelium integrity and increased invasive ability. The comparative transcriptome revealed potential brain-metastatic-specific key regulators involved in the aforementioned processes, e.g., the angiogenesis-related factors TNXIP and CXCL1. In addition, the transcriptomes of the two TNBC cell lines strongly differed in certain angiogenesis-associated factors and in several genes related to cell migration and invasion. Based on the present study, we hypothesize that the tumor cell’s ability to disrupt the BBB via angiogenesis activation, together with increased cellular motility, is required for BC cells to overcome the BBB and develop brain metastases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kowalik, Klaudia</author><author>Polak-berecka, Magdalena</author><author>Prendecka-Wrobel, Monika</author><author>Pigon-Zajac, Dominika</author><author>Niedzwiedz, Iwona</author><author>Szwajgier, Dominik</author><author>Baranowska-Wojcik, Ewa</author><author>Wasko, Adam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biological Activity of an Epilobium angustifolium L.

The content of selected phenolic compounds in the digested aqueous extract of fireweed was determined using HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. Biological activity was examined using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HT-29 and CaCo-2 and the human colon epithelial cell line CCD 841 CoTr. Cytotoxicity was assessed by an MTT assay, a Neutral Red uptake assay, May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining, and a label-free Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing cytotoxicity assay. The effect of the infusion on the growth of selected intestinal bacteria was also examined. The extract inhibited the growth of intestinal cancer cells HT-29. This effect can be attributed to the activity of quercetin and kaempferol, which were the most abundant phenolic compounds found in the extract after in vitro digestion. The cytotoxicity of the fireweed infusion was dose-dependent. The highest decrease in proliferation (by almost 80%) compared to the control was observed in HT-29 line treated with the extract at a concentration of 250 μg/mL. The fireweed infusion did not affect the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, but it did significantly inhibit E. coli. The cytotoxic effect of the fireweed extract indicates that it does not lose its biological activity after in vitro digestion. It can be concluded that the fireweed infusion has the potential to be used as a supporting agent in colon cancer therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guti, Eliza</author><author>Regdon, Zsolt</author><author>Sturniolo, Isotta</author><author>Kiss, Alexandra</author><author>Kovács, Katalin</author><author>Demény, Máté</author><author>Szöőr, Árpád</author><author>Vereb, György</author><author>Szöllősi, János</author><author>Hegedűs, Csaba</author><author>Polgár, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Virág, László</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib induces resistance of HER2 positive breast cancer cells to trastuzumab-mediated ADCC</title><secondary-title>Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>ADCC</keyword><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Herceptin</keyword><keyword>Natural killer cell</keyword><keyword>Sunitinib</keyword><keyword>Trastuzumab</keyword><keyword>adcc</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>herceptin</keyword><keyword>natural killer cell</keyword><keyword>sunitinib</keyword><keyword>trastuzumab</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00262-022-03146-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib induces resistance of HER2 positive breast cancer cells to trastuzumab-mediated ADCC.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-022-03146-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Despite recent advances in the development of novel personalized therapies, breast cancer continues to challenge physicians with resistance to various advanced therapies. The anticancer action of the anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab, involves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we report a repurposing screen of 774 clinically used compounds on NK-cell + trastuzumab-induced killing of JIMT-1 breast cancer cells. Using a calcein-based high-content screening (HCS) assay for the image-based quantitation of ADCC that we have developed and optimized for this purpose, we have found that the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib inhibits ADCC in this model. The cytoprotective effect of sunitinib was also confirmed with two other assays (lactate dehydrogenase release, and electric cell substrate impedance sensing, ECIS). The drug suppressed NK cell activation as indicated by reduced granzyme B deposition on to the target cells and inhibition of interferon-γ production by the NK cells. Moreover, sunitinib induced downregulation of HER2 on the target cells' surface, changed the morphology and increased adherence of the target cells. Moreover, sunitinib also triggered the autophagy pathway (speckled LC3b) as an additional potential underlying mechanism of the cytoprotective effect of the drug. Sunitinib-induced ADCC resistance has been confirmed in a 3D tumor model revealing the prevention of apoptotic cell death (Annexin V staining) in JIMT-1 spheroids co-incubated with NK cells and trastuzumab. In summary, our HCS assay may be suitable for the facile identification of ADCC boosting compounds. Our data urge caution concerning potential combinations of ADCC-based immunotherapies and sunitinib.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samsonov, Mikhail V</author><author>Podkuychenko, Nikita V</author><author>Khapchaev, Asker Y</author><author>Efremov, Eugene E</author><author>Yanushevskaya, Elena V</author><author>Vlasik, Tatiana N</author><author>Lankin, Vadim Z</author><author>Stafeev, Iurii S</author><author>Skulachev, Maxim V</author><author>Shestakova, Marina V</author><author>Vorotnikov, Alexander V</author><author>Shirinsky, Vladimir P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AICAR Protects Vascular Endothelial Cells from Oxidative Injury Induced by the Long-Term Palmitate Excess</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>211</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>huvec</keyword><keyword>hyperlipidemia</keyword><keyword>insulin signaling</keyword><keyword>no</keyword><keyword>palmitate</keyword><keyword>ros</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms23010211</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AICAR Protects Vascular Endothelial Cells from Oxidative Injury Induced by the Long-Term Palmitate Excess.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms23010211</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Hyperlipidemia manifested by high blood levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and lipoprotein triglycerides is critical for the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its cardiovascular complications via vascular endothelial dysfunction. However, attempts to assess high FFA effects in endothelial culture often result in early cell apoptosis that poorly recapitulates a much slower pace of vascular deterioration in vivo and does not provide for the longer-term studies of endothelial lipotoxicity in vitro. Here, we report that palmitate (PA), a typical FFA, does not impair, by itself, endothelial barrier and insulin signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), but increases NO release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and protein labeling by malondialdehyde (MDA) hallmarking oxidative stress and increased lipid peroxidation. This PA-induced stress eventually resulted in the loss of cell viability coincident with loss of insulin signaling. Supplementation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR) increased endothelial AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, supported insulin signaling, and prevented the PA-induced increases in NO, ROS, and MDA, thus allowing to maintain HUVEC viability and barrier, and providing the means to study the long-term effects of high FFA levels in endothelial cultures. An upgraded cell-based model reproduces FFA-induced insulin resistance by demonstrating decreased NO production by vascular endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rudraraju, Madhuri</author><author>Narayanan, S Priya</author><author>Somanath, Payaningal R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distinct Mechanisms of Human Retinal Endothelial Barrier Modulation In Vitro by Mediators of Diabetes and Uveitis</title><secondary-title>Life (Basel)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Life (Basel)</full-title></periodical><pages>33</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>claudin-5</keyword><keyword>hyperglycemia</keyword><keyword>lipopolysaccharide</keyword><keyword>tnf α</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/life12010033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Distinct Mechanisms of Human Retinal Endothelial Barrier Modulation In Vitro by Mediators of Diabetes and Uveitis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Flife12010033</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and uveitis are associated with injury to the blood–retinal barrier (BRB). Whereas high glucose (HG) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) contribute to DR, bacterial infections causing uveitis are triggered by endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is unclear how HG, AGE, and LPS affect human retinal endothelial cell (HREC) junctions. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is elevated in both DR and ocular infections. In the current study, we determined the direct effects of HG, AGE, TNFα, and LPS on the expression and intracellular distribution of claudin-5, VE-cadherin, and β-catenin in HRECs and how these mediators affect Akt and P38 MAP kinase that have been implicated in ocular pathologies. In our results, whereas HG, AGE, and TNFα activated both Akt and P38 MAPK, LPS treatment suppressed Akt but increased P38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, while treatment with AGE and HG increased cell-junction protein expression in HRECs, LPS elicited a paradoxical effect. By contrast, when HG treatment increased HREC-barrier resistance, AGE and LPS stimulation compromised it, and TNFα had no effect. Together, our results demonstrated the differential effects of the mediators of diabetes and infection on HREC-barrier modulation leading to BRB injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Sheng-Min</author><author>Hwang, Yih-Shiou</author><author>Liu, Chao-Lin</author><author>Shen, Chia-Ning</author><author>Hong, Wei-Hsin</author><author>Yang, Wei-Cheng</author><author>Lee, Meng-Hua</author><author>Shen, Chia-Rui</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibiting TLR7 Expression in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium Suppresses Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>EAU</keyword><keyword>IL-17</keyword><keyword>RPE</keyword><keyword>TLR7</keyword><keyword>autoimmune uveitis</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>eau</keyword><keyword>frontiers in immunology</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>il-17</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>rpe</keyword><keyword>tlr7</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2021.736261</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Inhibiting TLR7 Expression in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium Suppresses Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2021.736261</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a model of human uveitis, is an organ-specific, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Autoreactive T cells can penetrate the blood-retinal barrier, which is a physical defense composed of tight junction-linked retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. RPE cells serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the eye since they express MHC class I and II and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Although previous studies have shown that supplementation with TLR agonists exacerbates uveitis, little is known about how TLR signaling in the RPE contributes to the development of uveitis. In this study, we isolated the RPE from EAU mice, which were induced by active immunization (aEAU) or adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells (tEAU). The expression of TLRs on RPE was determined, and both aEAU and tEAU mice exhibited induced tlr7 expression. The TLR7 agonist R848 was shown to induce aggressive disease progression, along with significantly elevated levels of the uveopathogenic cytokine IL-17. Furthermore, not only IL-17 but also R848 appeared to enhance the inflammatory response and to impair the barrier function of the RPE, indicating that TLR7 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of EAU by affecting the behaviors of the RPE and consequently allowing the infiltration of autoreactive T cells intraocularly. Finally, local application of shRNA against TLR7 delivered by recombinant AAV effectively inhibited disease severity and reduced IFN-γ and IL-17. Our findings highlight an immunomodulatory role of RPE TLR7 in EAU development and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for autoimmune uveitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kremer, Veerle</author><author>Bink, Diewertje I</author><author>Stanicek, Laura</author><author>Ingen, Eva Van</author><author>Gimbel, Theresa</author><author>Hilderink, Sarah</author><author>Gunther, Stefan</author><author>Nossent, Anne Yael</author><author>Boon, Reinier A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MEG8 regulates Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 ( TFPI2 ) expression in the endothelium</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>843</issue><keywords><keyword>Cardiovascular biology</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular diseases</keyword><keyword>Molecular biology</keyword><keyword>Non-coding RNAs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>4159802204812</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-04812-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MEG8 regulates Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) expression in the endothelium.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-04812-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>A large portion of the genome is transcribed into non-coding RNA, which does not encode protein. Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in important regulatory processes such as genomic imprinting and chromatin modification. The 14q32 locus contains many non-coding RNAs such as Maternally Expressed Gene 8 (MEG8). We observed an induction of this gene in ischemic heart disease. We investigated the role of MEG8 specifically in endothelial function as well as the underlying mechanism. We hypothesized that MEG8 plays an important role in cardiovascular disease via epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Experiments were performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro silencing of MEG8 resulted in impaired angiogenic sprouting. More specifically, total sprout length was reduced as was proliferation, while migration was unaffected. We performed RNA sequencing to assess changes in gene expression after loss of MEG8. The most profoundly regulated gene, Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), was fivefold increased following MEG8 silencing. TFPI2 has previously been described as an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, MEG8 silencing resulted in a reduction of the inhibitory histone modification H3K27me3 at the TFPI2 promoter. Interestingly, additional silencing of TFPI2 partially restored angiogenic sprouting capacity but did not affect proliferation of MEG8 silenced cells. In conclusion, silencing of MEG8 impairs endothelial function, suggesting a potential beneficial role in maintaining cell viability.

Silencing Akt1 inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) cells growing; slow-growing cells tend to consume less nutrition. It is suggested that Akt1-silenced cancer cells will have a more substantial tolerance to NST. Clarify this critical question is vital for tumor treatment strategies based on Akt1 and NST. The Akt1 gene of PC3 and DU145 cells was silenced by lent-virus. NST model was established by serum stripping. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay and cell counting method. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and flow cytometry, and cell invasion was determined by transwells and ECIS. The markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected by western blotting. PCa lung metastasis model was established by tail vein injection and quantified by Indian ink and GFP fluorescence. Silencing Akt1 slowed down the decrease of cell number and increase of apoptosis caused by NST. Silencing Akt1 with NST exposure in PCa cells could down-regulate epithelial markers (E-cadherin, claudin-5, and ZO-1) and up-regulate mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and EMT regulators Snail. Although silencing Akt1 enhanced the invasion of PCa cells induced by NST in vitro, silencing Akt1 inhibited the PCa lung metastasis induced by NST in vivo. Silencing Akt1 gene enhances the resistance of PCa cells to NST. The invasion results in vitro were inconsistent with those metastases in vivo, which may be related to a combination of NST with silencing Akt1 to maintain the mesenchymal state of PCa cells through EMT.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Georg, Phillip</author><author>Astaburuaga-Garcia, Rosario</author><author>Bonaguro, Lorenzo</author><author>Brumhard, Sophia</author><author>Michalick, Laura</author><author>Lippert, Lena J.</author><author>Kostevc, Tomislav</author><author>Gabel, Christiane</author><author>Schnelder, Maria</author><author>Streitz, Mathias</author><author>Demichev, Vadim</author><author>Gemund, Ioanna</author><author>Barone, Matthias</author><author>Tober-Lau, Pinkus</author><author>Helbig, Elisa T.</author><author>Hillus, David</author><author>Petrov, Lev</author><author>Stein, Julia</author><author>Dey, Hannah-Philine</author><author>Paclik, Daniela</author><author>Iwert, Christina</author><author>Mulleder, Michael</author><author>Aulakh, Simran Kaur</author><author>Djudjaj, Sonja</author><author>Bulow, Roman D.</author><author>Mei, Henrik E.</author><author>Schulz, Axel R.</author><author>Thiel, Andreas</author><author>Hippenstiel, Stefan</author><author>Saliba, Antoine-Emmanuel</author><author>Eils, Roland</author><author>Lehmann, Irina</author><author>Mall, Marcus A.</author><author>Strciker, Sebastian</author><author>Rohmel, Jobst</author><author>Corman, Victor M.</author><author>Beule, Dieter</author><author>Wyler, Emanuel</author><author>Landthaler, Markus</author><author>Obermayer, Benedikt</author><author>Stillfried, Saskia von</author><author>Boor, Peter</author><author>Demir, Munevver</author><author>Wesselmann, Hans</author><author>Suttorp, Norbert</author><author>Uhrig, Alexander</author><author>Muller-Redetzky, Holger</author><author>Nattermann, Jacob</author><author>Kuebler, Wolfgang M.</author><author>Meisel, Christian</author><author>Ralser, Markus</author><author>Schultze, Joachim L.</author><author>Aschenbrenner, Anna C.</author><author>Thibeault, Charlotte</author><author>Kurth, Florian</author><author>Sander, Leif E.</author><author>Bluthgen, Nils</author><author>Sawitzki, Birgit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complement activation induces excessive T cell cytotoxicity in severe COVID-19</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><issue>December</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2021.12.040</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Complement activation induces excessive T cell cytotoxicity in severe COVID-19.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2021.12.040</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;TEER</label><abstract>Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Yiming</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Dong, Xuefei</author><author>Cui, Yuxin</author><author>Dou, Qing Ping</author><author>Jia, Shuqin</author><author>Hao, Chunyl</author><author>Ji, Jiafu</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule ( ALCAM )/ CD166 in pancreatic cancer , a pivotal link to clinical outcome and vascular embolism</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>5917-5932</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>activated leukocyte cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>alcam</keyword><keyword>cd166</keyword><keyword>embolism</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>molecule</keyword><keyword>pancreatic cancer</keyword><keyword>progression</keyword><keyword>survival</keyword><keyword>tumour-endothelial interaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)-CD166 in pancreatic cancer, a pivotal link to clinical outcome and vascular embolism.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc8727815/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM, or CD166) is a cell adhesion molecule and one of potential tumour metastasis ‘soil’ receptors that via homotypic and heterotypic interactions, mediates cancer cell adhesion. The present study investigated clinical, pathological and prognostic values of ALCAM in patients with pancreatic cancer. Human pancreatic cancer (PANC-1 and Mia PaCa-2) and human vascular endothelial cell lines were used to construct cell models differentially expressing levels of ALCAM. Tumour-endothelial interaction and tumour migration were assessed by a DiI-based method and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assay. Pancreatic cancer tissues (n=223), collected immediately after surgery, were analysed for levels of the ALCAM transcripts, which were also analysed against clinical, pathological and clinical outcomes of the patients. ALCAM protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our study demonstrate that pancreatic cancer tissues had significantly higher levels of ALCAM transcripts than normal tissues (P&lt;0.00001). There were no significant differences with staging, differentiation and tumour locations. Tumours from patients who died of pancreatic cancer had significantly high levels of ALCAM compared with those who lived (P=0.018), and this finding was further supported by ROC analysis (P=0.016). Multivariant analysis showed that ALCAM is an independent prognosis factor for overall survival (HR=5.485), with both nodal status and TNM staging contributing to the model (HR=2.578 and 3.02, respectively). A surprising finding was the relationship between ALCAM expression and microvessel embolism of tumour cells (P=0.021, with vs without tumour embolism). Levels of ALCAM were found to be a determinant factor to adherence of the pancreatic cancer cells to vascular endothelial cells, as demonstrated by pancreatic cancer cell models genetically engineered to express differential levels of ALCAM. The tumour-endothelial interaction mediated by ALCAM was readily blocked by addition of soluble ALCAM. Our data supports the conclusion that ALCAM expression is aberrant in pancreatic cancer and its raised expression is an independent prognostic factor for the survival of the patients and the microvascular embolism by cancer cells. Our results suggest that ALCAM plays a key role in mediating tumour-endothelial cell interactions and enhancing tumour embolism in pancreatic cancer, and targeting ALCAM represents a potential therapeutic strategy for treating human pancreatic cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mcrae, Hannah L</author><author>Millar, Michelle Warren</author><author>Slavin, Spencer A</author><author>Blumberg, Neil</author><author>Rahman, Arshad</author><author>Refaai, Majed A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential Role of Rho-Associated Kinase in ABO Immune Complex-Mediated Endothelial Barrier Disruption</title><secondary-title>Biomedicines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedicines</full-title></periodical><pages>1851</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>ABO blood groups</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>immune complexes</keyword><keyword>transfusion</keyword><keyword>vascular biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/biomedicines9121851</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Essential Role of Rho-Associated Kinase in ABO Immune Complex-Mediated Endothelial Barrier Disruption.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiomedicines9121851</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>ABO immune complexes (ABO-IC) formed by ABO-incompatible antigen-antibody interaction are associated with hemolysis and platelet destruction in patients transfused with ABO-nonidentical blood products. However, the effects of ABO-IC on endothelial cells (EC) are unclear. ABO-IC were formed in vitro from normal donor-derived plasma and serum. Human pulmonary artery EC (HPAEC) were cultured and treated with media, ABO-identical and –non-identical plasma, and ABO-IC. EC barrier integrity was evaluated using transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and phalloidin staining, and Rho-associated Kinase (ROCK) inhibitor treatment. TEER revealed significant/irreversible barrier disruption within 1–2 h of exposure to ABO non-identical plasma and ABO-IC; this occurred independently of EC ABO type. Treatment with ABO-IC resulted in decreased VE-cadherin staining and increased phalloidin staining in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that the resultant increased EC barrier permeability is secondary to actin stress fiber formation and loss of cell surface VE-cadherin. Inhibition of ROCK was effective in protecting against IC-induced barrier disruption even two hours after ABO-IC exposure. ABO-IC causes increased EC barrier permeability by decreasing cell surface VE-cadherin and promoting stress fiber formation, which is preventable by inhibiting ROCK activation to protect against EC contraction and gap formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fikatas, Antonios</author><author>Dehairs, Jonas</author><author>Noppen, Sam</author><author>Doijen, Jordi</author><author>Vanderhoydonc, Frank</author><author>Meyen, Eef</author><author>Swinnen, Johannes V.</author><author>Pannecouque, Christophe</author><author>Schols, Dominique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deciphering the role of extracellular vesicles derived from ZIKV-infected hcMEC/D3 cells on the blood–brain barrier system</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>Extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>Lipidomics</keyword><keyword>Monolayer integrity</keyword><keyword>Viral transmission</keyword><keyword>Zika virus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v13122363</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Deciphering the Role of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from ZIKV-Infected hcMEC D3 Cells on the Blood–Brain Barrier System.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fv13122363</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>To date, no vaccines or antivirals are available against Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-associated pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS) are largely unexplored. Getting more insight into the cellular pathways that ZIKV recruits to facilitate infection of susceptible cells will be crucial for establishing an effective treatment strategy. In general, cells secrete a number of vesicles, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), in response to viral infections. These EVs serve as intercellular communicators. Here, we investigated the role of EVs derived from ZIKV-infected human brain microvascular endothelial cells on the blood–brain barrier (BBB) system. We demonstrated that ZIKV-infected EVs (IEVs) can incorporate viral components, including ZIKV RNA, NS1, and E-protein, and further transfer them to several types of CNS cells. Using label-free impedance-based biosensing, we observed that ZIKV and IEVs can temporally disturb the monolayer integrity of BBB-mimicking cells, possibly by inducing structural rearrangements of the adherent protein VE-cadherin (immunofluorescence staining). Finally, differences in the lipidomic profile between EVs and their parental cells possibly suggest a preferential sorting mechanism of specific lipid species into the vesicles. To conclude, these data suggest that IEVs could be postulated as vehicles (Trojan horse) for ZIKV transmission via the BBB.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Robilliard, Laverne Diana</author><author>Yu, Jane</author><author>Jun, Sung-Min</author><author>Anchan, Akshata</author><author>Finlay, Graeme</author><author>Angel, Catherine E.</author><author>Graham, Euan Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can ECIS Biosensor Technology Be Used to Measure the Cellular Responses of Glioblastoma Stem Cells?</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><pages>498</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios11120498</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Can ECIS Biosensor Technology Be Used to Measure the Cellular Responses of Glioblastoma Stem Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbios11120498</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Glioblastoma is considered the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer. Glioblas-toma tumours are complex, comprising a spectrum of oncogenically transformed cells displaying distinct phenotypes. These can be generated in culture and are called differentiated-glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma stem cells. These cells are phenotypically and functionally distinct, where the stem-like glioblastoma cells give rise to and perpetuate the tumour. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a real-time, label-free, impedance-based method for the analysis of cellular be-haviour, based on cellular adhesion. Therefore, we asked the question of whether ECIS was suitable for, and capable of measuring the adhesion of glioblastoma cells. The goal was to identify whether ECIS was capable of measuring glioblastoma cell adhesion, with a particular focus on the glioblas-toma stem cells. We reveal that ECIS reliably measures adhesion of the differentiated glioblastoma cells on various array types. We also demonstrate the ability of ECIS to measure the migratory behaviour of differentiated glioblastoma cells onto ECIS electrodes post-ablation. Although the glioblastoma stem cells are adherent, ECIS is substantially less capable at reliably measuring their adhesion, compared with the differentiated counterparts. This means that ECIS has applicability for some glioblastoma cultures but much less utility for weakly adherent stem cell counterparts.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peachazepei de Moraes, Carla Roberta</author><author>Teixeira de Borba Junior, Ivanio</author><author>Lima, Franciele de</author><author>Barbosa, Mayck Silva</author><author>Huber, Stephany Cares</author><author>Palma, Andre C.</author><author>Nunes, Thyago A.</author><author>Ulaf, Rasia G.</author><author>Ribeiro, Luciana C.</author><author>Bernandes, Ana Flavia</author><author>Bombassaro, Bruna</author><author>Dertkigil, Sergio S.</author><author>Moretti, Maria Luiza</author><author>Bizzacchi, Joyce Annichino</author><author>Mansour, Eli</author><author>Velloso, Licio Augusto</author><author>Costa, Fabio Trindade Maranhao</author><author>Orsi, Fernanda Andrade</author><author>De Paula, Erich V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulating Levels of Ang/Tie2 and VEGF-a Pathway Mediators Are Associated with Clinical Severity, Endothelial Barrier Disruption and Coagulation Activation in COVID-19</title><secondary-title>Blood</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Blood</full-title></periodical><pages>2073</pages><issue>138</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1182/blood-2021-152771</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Circulating Levels of Ang Tie2 and VEGF-a Pathway Mediators Are Associated with Clinical Severity, Endothelial Barrier Disruption and Coagulation Activation in COVID-19.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1182%2Fblood-2021-152771</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19</label><abstract>Background: the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 involves the deregulated activation of different compartments of immunothrombosis, which are otherwise important for pathogen eradication and tissue repair. Coagulation activation, angiogenesis and alterations of endothelial barrier (EB) are elements of immunothrombosis that have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 2 and their receptor Tie2 and VEGF-A are well-known pro-angiogenic mediators that, during inflammation also mediate EB disruption. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that the Ang/Tie2 pathway is involved in coagulation activation. Here we explored whether increased levels of angiogenesis/EB regulators (which have been previously associated with disease severity in COVID-19) are also associated with both EB disruption and coagulation activation in this condition. Methods: the study population consisted of 30 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and presenting typical CT findings admitted due to hypoxemia. Thirty sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were recruited at the same time, from the same geographic region. Patients were part of a clinical trial (REBEC: U1111-1250-1843) but samples were obtained before any study intervention, within 24 hours from diagnosis confirmation. Circulating levels of angiogenesis/EB regulation mediators and coagulation biomarkers were measured by commercial assays (immunological or functional). Monolayers of endothelial cells from umbilical veins (HUVECs) or lung (HULECs) were used for measurement of EB integrity using an impedance sensor system (ECIS, Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing System). Cells were stimulated with serum from patients or healthy individuals and EB integrity was continuously monitored for 36 hours. Clinical outcomes were obtained from the digital medical records. Results: mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was 12.9 ± 9.8 days. Twelve patients (40%) required intensive care (ICU) and 28/30 patients survived. Mean D-dimer was 3,609 ± 14,440 ng/mL. Circulating levels of Ang1, Ang2, sTie2 and VEGF-A were all significantly increased in patients compared to healthy individuals (Ang1: 463.2 ± 194.6 vs 237.4 ± 104.9 pg/mL, p&lt;0.0001; Ang2: 1,926 (1,275 - 3,134) vs 1,215 (9 - 1,440 pg/mL), p&lt;0.0001; Tie2: 10,753 ± 2,377 vs 8,603 ± 1,851 pg/mL, p&lt;0.0001 and VEGF-A: 94.7 (73.4 - 116.0) vs 45.9 (39.7 - 57.0 pg/mL), p&lt;0.0001.). In contrast, soluble VE-cadherin levels were decreased in patients compared to healthy individuals (1,234 ± 318 vs 1,539 ± 363 ng/mL, P=0.001). Serum from COVID-19 patients induced decreases of EB integrity in monolayers of both HUVECs and HULECs as early as 15 minutes, lasting up to 5 hours after stimulation (figure 1). The magnitude of EB disruption was correlated with clinically relevant outcomes such as time of ICU stay and LOS (figure 1). Interestingly, levels of Ang1, Ang2 and soluble VE-cadherin levels were also significantly correlated with the magnitude of EB disruption, as well as with biomarkers of coagulation activation such as fibrinogen, Von Willebrand Factor antigen levels, PAI-1, P-selectin and urokinase receptor (uPAR). Conclusions: Ang-1/Ang-2 mediated Tie2 signaling has been shown to be important for the fine regulation of barrier integrity and coagulation activation at the endothelial level, which are two critical elements of immunothrombosis. Our results provide evidence supporting that the interplay between these processes can play a role in the mechanisms driving COVID-19 severity, and suggest that targeting the Ang/Tie2 and VEGF-A pathways could be attractive strategies to modulate not only changes of the alveolar-capillary barrier, but also of coagulation activation in COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yun, Xin</author><author>Philip, Nicolas M.</author><author>Jiang, Haiyang</author><author>Smith, Zion</author><author>Huetsch, John C.</author><author>Damarla, Mahendra</author><author>Suresh, Karthik</author><author>Shimoda, Larissa A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upregulation of Aquaporin 1 Mediates Increased Migration and Proliferation in Pulmonary Vascular Cells From the Rat SU5416/Hypoxia Model of Pulmonary Hypertension</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Physiology</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>December</issue><keywords><keyword>lung</keyword><keyword>microvascular endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>pulmonary arterial hypertension</keyword><keyword>smooth muscle cells</keyword><keyword>﻿smooth muscle cells﻿</keyword><keyword>﻿﻿lung﻿</keyword><keyword>﻿﻿microvascular endothelial cells﻿</keyword><keyword>﻿﻿pulmonary arterial hypertension﻿</keyword><keyword>﻿﻿remodeling﻿</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphys.2021.763444</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Upregulation of Aquaporin 1 Mediates Increased Migration and Proliferation in Pulmonary Vascular Cells From the Rat SU5416 Hypoxia Model of Pulmonary Hypertension.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphys.2021.763444</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder characterized by exuberant vascular remodeling leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, maladaptive right ventricular remodeling, and eventual death. The factors controlling pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) and endothelial cell hyperplasia and migration, hallmark features of the vascular remodeling observed in PAH, remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that hypoxia upregulates the expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a water channel, in PASMCs, and that this upregulation was required for hypoxia-induced migration and proliferation. However, whether the same is true in a model of severe PAH and in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) is unknown. In this study, we used the SU5416 plus hypoxia (SuHx) rat model of severe pulmonary hypertension, which mimics many of the features of human PAH, to determine whether AQP1 levels were altered in PASMCs and MVECs and contributed to a hyperproliferative/hypermigratory phenotype. Rats received a single injection of SU5416 (20 mg/kg) and then were placed in 10% O 2 for 3 weeks, followed by a return to normoxic conditions for an additional 2 weeks. We found that AQP1 protein levels were increased in both PASMCs and MVECs from SuHx rats, even in the absence of sustained hypoxic exposure, and that in MVECs, the increase in protein expression was associated with upregulation of AQP1 mRNA levels. Silencing of AQP1 had no significant effect on PASMCs from control animals but normalized enhanced migration and proliferation observed in cells from SuHx rats. Loss of AQP1 also reduced migration and proliferation in MVECs from SuHx rats. Finally, augmenting AQP1 levels in MVECs from control rats using forced expression was sufficient to increase migration and proliferation. These results demonstrate a key role for enhanced AQP1 expression in mediating abnormal migration and proliferation in pulmonary vascular cells from a rodent model that reflects many of the features of human PAH.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaidi, Yusra</author><author>Corker, Alexa</author><author>Vasileva, Valeriia Y.</author><author>Oviedo, Kimberly</author><author>Graham, Connor</author><author>Wilson, Kyrie</author><author>Martino, John</author><author>Troncoso, Miguel</author><author>Broughton, Philip</author><author>Ilatovskaya, Daria V.</author><author>Lindsey, Merry L.</author><author>DeLeon-Pennell, Kristine Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces adverse myocardial infarction wound healing through activation of CD8 + T cells</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>H948-H962</pages><volume>321</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>T cells</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>memory immune response</keyword><keyword>myocardial infarction</keyword><keyword>periodontal disease</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpheart.00082.2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Chronic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces adverse myocardial infarction wound healing through activation of CD8+ T cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1152%2Fajpheart.00082.2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Although there is a well-documented link between periodontal disease and heart health, the mechanisms are unclear. Our study indicates that in response to circulating periodontal endotoxins, memory CD8 + T cells are activated, resulting in an acceleration of macrophage-mediated inflammation after MI. Blocking activation of effector CD8 + T cells had no effect on the macrophage numbers or wall thinning at post-MI day 1, indicating that this response was likely due in part to memory CD8 + T cells. Oral and gum health have long been associated with incidence and outcomes of cardiovascular disease. Periodontal disease increases myocardial infarction (MI) mortality by sevenfold through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a periodontal pathogen accelerates inflammation after MI through memory T-cell activation. We compared four groups [no MI, chronic LPS, day 1 after MI, and day 1 after MI with chronic LPS (LPS + MI); n = 68 mice] using the mouse heart attack research tool 1.0 database and tissue bank coupled with new analyses and experiments. LPS + MI increased total CD8 + T cells in the left ventricle versus the other groups ( P &lt; 0.05 vs. all). Memory CD8 + T cells (CD44 + CD27 + ) were 10-fold greater in LPS + MI than in MI alone ( P = 0.02). Interleukin (IL)-4 stimulated splenic CD8 + T cells away from an effector phenotype and toward a memory phenotype, inducing secretion of factors associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling that promoted monocyte migration and decreased viability. To dissect the effect of CD8 + T cells after MI, we administered a major histocompatibility complex-I-blocking antibody starting 7 days before MI, which prevented effector CD8 + T-cell activation without affecting the memory response. The reduction in effector cells diminished infarct wall thinning but had no effect on macrophage numbers or MertK expression. LPS + MI + IgG attenuated macrophages within the infarct without effecting CD8 + T cells, suggesting these two processes were independent. Overall, our data indicate that effector and memory CD8 + T cells at post-MI day 1 are amplified by chronic LPS to potentially promote infarct wall thinning.

Electrical impedance sensing technology has become a powerful tool, allowing for rapid, non-invasive, and label-free acquisition of electrical parameters of single cells. These electrical parameters, i.e., equivalent cell resistance, membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity, are closely related to cellular biophysical properties and dynamic activities, such as size, morphology, membrane intactness, growth state, and proliferation. This review summarizes basic principles, analytical models and design concepts of single-cell impedance sensing devices, including impedance flow cytometry (IFC) to detect flow-through single cells and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to monitor immobilized single cells. Then, recent advances of both electrical impedance sensing systems applied in cell recognition, cell counting, viability detection, phenotypic assay, cell screening, and other cell detection are presented. Finally, prospects of impedance sensing technology in single-cell analysis are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kruk, Dennis M.

We hypothesized that lung-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSCs) reduce alveolar epithelial damage via paracrine pro-cesses, and may thus be suitable for cell-based strategies in COPD. We aimed to assess whether COPD-derived LMSCs display abnormalities. LMSCs were isolated from lung tissue of severe COPD patients and non-COPD controls. Effects of LMSC conditioned-medium (CM) on H2O2-induced, electric field-and scratch-injury were studied in A549 and NCI-H441 epithelial cells. In organoid models, LMSCs were co-cultured with NCI-H441 or primary lung cells. Organoid number, size and expression of alveolar type II markers were assessed. Pre-treatment with LMSC-CM significantly attenuated oxidative stress-induced necrosis and accelerated wound repair in A549. Co-culture with LMSCs supported organoid formation in NCI-H441 and primary epithelial cells, resulting in significantly larger organoids with lower type II-marker positivity in the presence of COPD-derived versus control LMSCs. Similar abnormalities developed in organoids from COPD compared to control-derived lung cells, with significantly larger organoids. Collectively, this indicates that LM-SCs’ secretome attenuates alveolar epithelial injury and supports epithelial repair. Additionally, LMSCs promote generation of alveolar organoids, with abnormalities in the supportive effects of COPD-derived LMCS, reflective of impaired regenerative responses of COPD distal lung cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Kyle H</author><author>Murphy, Haley A</author><author>Chapman, Heather</author><author>George, Eric M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syncytialization alters the extracellular matrix and barrier function of placental trophoblasts</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology Cell Physiology</full-title></periodical><volume>321</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpcell.00177.2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00177.2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The human placenta is of vital importance for proper nutrient and waste exchange, immune regulation, and overall fetal health and growth. Specifically, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, which extends outward from the placental chorionic villi into maternal blood, acts on a molecular level to regulate and maintain this barrier. Importantly, placental barrier dysfunction has been linked to diseases of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. To help facilitate our understanding of the interface and develop therapeutics to repair or prevent dysfunction of the placental barrier, in vitro models of the placental ECM would be of great value. In this study, we aimed to characterize the ECM of an in vitro model of the placental barrier using syncytialized BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. Syncytialization caused a marked change in syndecans, integral proteoglycans of the ECM, which matched observations of in vivo placental ECM. Syndecan-1 expression increased greatly and predominated the other variants. Barrier function of the ECM, as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), increased significantly during and after syncytialization, whereas the ability of THP-1 monocytes to adhere to syncytialized BeWos was greatly reduced compared with nonsyncytialized controls. Furthermore, ECIS measurements indicated that ECM degradation with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), but not heparanase, decreased barrier function. This decrease in ECIS-measured barrier function was not associated with any changes in THP-1 adherence to syncytialized BeWos treated with heparanase or MMP-9. Thus, syncytialization of BeWos provides a physiologically accurate placental ECM with a barrier function matching that seen in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silva-, João L</author><author>Dos-, João C K</author><author>Venugopal, Kannan</author><author>Lima, Diogenes</author><author>Nakaya, Helder I</author><author>Paula, Erich V De</author><author>Lopes, Stefanie C P</author><author>Lacerda, Marcus V G</author><author>Marti, Matthias</author><author>Costa, Fabio T M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia is associated with endothelial and haematological perturbations in Plasmodium vivax patients</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><pages>1-25</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.71351</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia is associated with endothelial and haematological perturbations in Plasmodium vivax patients.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554%2FeLife.71351</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Plasmodium vivax is the major cause of human malaria in the Americas. How P. vivax infection can lead to poor clinical outcomes, despite low peripheral parasitaemia, remains a matter of intense debate. Estimation of total P. vivax biomass based on circulating markers indicates existence of a predominant parasite population outside of circulation. In this study, we investigate associations between both peripheral and total parasite biomass and host response in vivax malaria. We analysed parasite and host signatures in a cohort of uncomplicated vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Brazil, combining clinical and parasite parameters, multiplexed analysis of host responses, and ex vivo assays. Patterns of clinical features, parasite burden, and host signatures measured in plasma across the patient cohort were highly heterogenous. Further data deconvolution revealed two patient clusters, here termed Vivaxlow and Vivaxhigh. These patient subgroups were defined based on differences in total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. Overall Vivaxlow patients clustered with healthy donors and Vivaxhigh patients showed more profound alterations in haematological parameters, endothelial cell (EC) activation, and glycocalyx breakdown and levels of cytokines regulating different haematopoiesis pathways compared to Vivaxlow. Vivaxhigh patients presented more severe thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, along with enrichment of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLCR). When patients’ signatures were combined, high association of total parasite biomass with a subset of markers of EC activation, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia severity was observed. Finally, machine learning models defined a combination of host parameters measured in the circulation that could predict the extent of parasite infection outside of circulation. Altogether, our data show that total parasite biomass is a better predictor of perturbations in host homeostasis in P. vivax patients than peripheral parasitaemia. This supports the emerging paradigm of a P. vivax tissue reservoir, particularly in the haematopoietic niche of bone marrow and spleen.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burkard, Natalie</author><author>Meir, Michael</author><author>Kannapin, Felix</author><author>Otto, Christoph</author><author>Petzke, Maximilian</author><author>Germer, Christoph-Thomas</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author><author>Schlegel, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Desmoglein2 Regulates Claudin2 Expression by Sequestering PI-3-Kinase in Intestinal Epithelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>Claudin2</keyword><keyword>Dsg2</keyword><keyword>PI-3-kinase</keyword><keyword>claudin2</keyword><keyword>desmosome</keyword><keyword>disease</keyword><keyword>dsg2</keyword><keyword>in fl ammation</keyword><keyword>in fl ammatory bowel</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>inflammatory bowel disease</keyword><keyword>intestinal barrier</keyword><keyword>pi-3-kinase</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2021.756321</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Desmoglein2 Regulates Claudin2 Expression by Sequestering PI-3-Kinase in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2021.756321</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Inflammation-induced reduction of intestinal desmosomal cadherin Desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) is linked to changes of tight junctions (TJ) leading to impaired intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) function by undefined mechanisms.

Intraperitoneal application of Dsg2-stablising Tandem peptide (TP) attenuated impaired IEB function, reduction of Dsg2 and increased Claudin2 in DSS-induced colitis in C57Bl/6 mice. TP blocked loss of Dsg2-mediated adhesion and upregulation of Claudin2 in Caco2 cells challenged with TNFα. In Dsg2-deficient Caco2 cells basal expression of Claudin2 was increased which was paralleled by reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and by augmented phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 under basal conditions. Inhibition of phosphoinositid-3-kinase proved that PI-3-kinase/AKT-signaling is critical to upregulate Claudin2. In immunostaining PI-3-kinase dissociated from Dsg2 under inflammatory conditions. Immunoprecipitations and proximity ligation assays confirmed a direct interaction of Dsg2 and PI-3-kinase which was abrogated following TNFα application. In summary, Dsg2 regulates Claudin2 expression by sequestering PI-3-kinase to the cell borders in intestinal epithelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Passman, Adam M</author><author>Strauss, Robyn P</author><author>McSpadden, Sarah B</author><author>Finch-Edmondson, Megan</author><author>Andrewartha, Neil</author><author>Woo, Ken H</author><author>Diepeveen, Luke A</author><author>Zhao, Weihao</author><author>Fernandez-Irigoyen, Joaquin</author><author>Santamaria, Enrique</author><author>Medina-ruiz, Laura</author><author>Szpakowska, Martyna</author><author>Chevigne, Andy</author><author>Park, Hyerin</author><author>Carlessi, Rodrigo</author><author>Tirnitz-parker, Janina E E</author><author>Blanco, Jose R</author><author>London, Roslyn</author><author>Callus, Bernard A</author><author>Elsegood, Caryn L</author><author>Baker, Murray V</author><author>Martinez, Alfredo</author><author>Yeoh, George C T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Maraviroc Prevents HCC Development by Suppressing Macrophages and the Liver Progenitor Cell Response in a Murine Chronic Liver Disease Model</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>CCL5 chemokine</keyword><keyword>Maraviroc</keyword><keyword>hepatocellular carcinoma</keyword><keyword>liver progenitor cells</keyword><keyword>macrophages</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers13194935</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Maraviroc Prevents HCC Development by Suppressing Macrophages and the Liver Progenitor Cell Response in a Murine Chronic Liver Disease Model.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcancers13194935</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Simple Summary Liver stem cells and activated macrophages have been implicated as contributors to liver cancer; hence, reducing their abundance is a potential avenue for therapy. In this article, we demonstrate that Maraviroc, a drug approved for human use, reduces the liver stem cell response and macrophage activation in a mouse model of liver cancer. These findings underline the preventive potential of this drug in liver cancer, a deadly disease for which there are few effective treatments. Abstract Maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist, reduces liver fibrosis, injury and tumour burden in mice fed a hepatocarcinogenic diet, suggesting it has potential as a cancer therapeutic. We investigated the effect of MVC on liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and macrophages as both have a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Mice were fed the hepatocarcinogenic choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet (CDE) ± MVC, and immunohistochemistry, RNA and protein expression were used to determine LPC and macrophage abundance, migration and related molecular mechanisms. MVC reduced LPC numbers in CDE mice by 54%, with a smaller reduction seen in macrophages. Transcript and protein abundance of LPC-associated markers correlated with this reduction. The CDE diet activated phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 and was inhibited by MVC. LPCs did not express Ccr5 in our model; in contrast, macrophages expressed high levels of this receptor, suggesting the effect of MVC is mediated by targeting macrophages. MVC reduced CD45+ cells and macrophage migration in liver and blocked the CDE-induced transition of liver macrophages from an M1- to M2-tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype. These findings suggest MVC has potential as a re-purposed therapeutic agent for treating chronic liver diseases where M2-TAM and LPC numbers are increased, and the incidence of HCC is enhanced.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bozzuto, Giuseppina</author><author>D’Avenio, Giuseppe</author><author>Condello, Maria</author><author>Sennato, Simona</author><author>Battaglione, Ezio</author><author>Familiari, Giuseppe</author><author>Molinari, Agnese</author><author>Grigioni, Mauro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Label-free cell based impedance measurements of ZnO nanoparticles—human lung cell interaction: a comparison with MTT, NR, Trypan blue and cloning efficiency assays</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nanobiotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nanobiotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Confocal microscopy</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxicity tests</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance</keyword><keyword>Electron microscopy</keyword><keyword>Nanomaterials</keyword><keyword>Zinc oxide nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>confocal</keyword><keyword>cytotoxicity tests</keyword><keyword>electric cell-substrate impedance</keyword><keyword>electron microscopy</keyword><keyword>microscopy</keyword><keyword>nanomaterials</keyword><keyword>zinc oxide nanoparticles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12951-021-01033-w</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Label-free cell based impedance measurements of ZnO nanoparticles—human lung cell interaction a comparison with MTT, NR, Trypan blue and cloning efficiency assays.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-021-01033-w</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Background There is a huge body of literature data on ZnOnanoparticles (ZnO NPs) toxicity. However, the reported results are seen to be increasingly discrepant, and deep comprehension of the ZnO NPs behaviour in relation to the different experimental conditions is still lacking. A recent literature overview emphasizes the screening of the ZnO NPs toxicity with more than one assay, checking the experimental reproducibility also versus time, which is a key factor for the robustness of the results. In this paper we compared high-throughput real-time measurements through Electric Cell-substrate Impedance-Sensing (ECIS®) with endpoint measurements of multiple independent assays. Results ECIS-measurements were compared with traditional cytotoxicity tests such as MTT, Neutral red, Trypan blue, and cloning efficiency assays. ECIS could follow the cell behavior continuously and noninvasively for days, so that certain long-term characteristics of cell proliferation under treatment with ZnO NPs were accessible. This was particularly important in the case of pro-mitogenic activity exerted by low-dose ZnO NPs, an effect not revealed by endpoint independent assays. This result opens new worrisome questions about the potential mitogenic activity exerted by ZnO NPs, or more generally by NPs, on transformed cells. Of importance, impedance curve trends (morphology) allowed to discriminate between different cell death mechanisms (apoptosis vs autophagy) in the absence of specific reagents, as confirmed by cell structural and functional studies by high-resolution microscopy. This could be advantageous in terms of costs and time spent. ZnO NPs-exposed A549 cells showed an unusual pattern of actin and tubulin distribution which might trigger mitotic aberrations leading to genomic instability. Conclusions ZnO NPs toxicity can be determined not only by the intrinsic NPs characteristics, but also by the external conditions like the experimental setting, and this could account for discrepant data from different assays. ECIS has the potential to recapitulate the needs required in the evaluation of nanomaterials by contributing to the reliability of cytotoxicity tests. Moreover, it can overcome some false results and discrepancies in the results obtained by endpoint measurements. Finally, we strongly recommend the comparison of cytotoxicity tests (ECIS, MTT, Trypan Blue, Cloning efficiency) with the ultrastructural cell pathology studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caliva, Maisel J.</author><author>Yang, Won Seok</author><author>Young-Robbins, Shirley</author><author>Zhou, Ming</author><author>Yoon, Hana</author><author>Matter, Michelle L.</author><author>Grimes, Mark L.</author><author>Conrads, Thomas</author><author>Ramos, Joe William</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proteomics analysis identifies PEA-15 as an endosomal phosphoprotein that regulates α5β1 integrin endocytosis</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-021-99348-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Proteomics analysis identifies PEA-15 as an endosomal phosphoprotein that regulates α5β1 integrin endocytosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99348-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Endosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors is essential to their function. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that integrate adhesion to the extracellular matrix with engagement of the cytoskeleton. Ligated integrins mediate diverse signals that regulate matrix assembly, cell survival, cell morphology, and cell motility. Endosomal trafficking of integrins modulates these signals and contributes to cell motility and is required for cancer cell invasion. The phosphoprotein PEA-15 modulates integrin activation and ERK MAP Kinase signaling. To elucidate novel PEA-15 functions we utilized an unbiased proteomics approach. We identified several binding partners for PEA-15 in the endosome including clathrin and AP-2 as well as integrin β1 and other focal adhesion complex proteins. We confirmed these interactions using proximity ligation analysis, immunofluorescence imaging, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. We further found that PEA-15 is enriched in endosomes and was required for efficient endosomal internalization of α5β1 integrin and cellular migration. Importantly, PEA-15 promotion of migration was dependent on PEA-15 phosphorylation at serines 104 and 116. These data support a novel endosomal role for PEA-15 in control of endosomal trafficking of integrins through an association with the β1 integrin and clathrin complexes, and thereby regulation of cell motility.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mascarenhas, Joseph B</author><author>Gaber, Amir A</author><author>Larrinaga, Tania M</author><author>Mayfield, Rachel</author><author>Novak, Stefanie</author><author>Camp, Sara M.</author><author>Gregorio, Carol</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey</author><author>Cress, Anne E</author><author>Dudek, Steven</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.

The current study investigates the role of Ena-VASP-like (EVL), a member of the Ena-VASP family known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, in regulating vascular permeability responses and lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity. Utilizing changes in transendothelial electricial resistance (TEER) to measure EC barrier responses, we demonstrate that EVL expression regulates EC responses to both sphingosine-1-phospate (S1P), a vascular barrier-enhancing agonist, and to thrombin, a barrier-disrupting stimulus. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) demonstrates that EVL is present in EC focal adhesions (FA) and impacts FA size, distribution, and the number of FAs generated in response to S1P and thrombin challenge, with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) a key contributor in S1P-stimulated EVL-transduced EC but a limited role in thrombin-induced FA rearrangements. In summary, these data indicate that EVL is a FA protein intimately involved in regulation of cytoskeletal responses to EC barrier-altering stimuli.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suresh, Karthik</author><author>Servinsky, Laura</author><author>Johnston, Laura</author><author>Punjabi, Naresh M.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author><author>Damarla, Mahendra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of polynomial fitting versus single time point analysis of ECIS data for barrier assessment</title><secondary-title>Physiological Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>electrical cell-</keyword><keyword>substrate impedance sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.14814/phy2.14983</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Comparison of polynomial fitting versus single time point analysis of ECIS data for barrier assessment.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.14814%2Fphy2.14983</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;Theory</label><abstract>Electrical cell‐substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an in vitro methodology for measuring the barrier integrity of a variety of cell types, including pulmonary endothelial cells. These experiments are frequently used for in vitro assessment of lung injury. The data derived from ECIS experiments consists of repeated measures of resistance across an endothelial monolayer. As such, these data reflect the dynamic changes in electrical resistance that occur over time. Currently methodologies for assessing ECIS data rely on single point assessments of barrier function, such as the maximal drop in trans‐endothelial electrical resistance (TERMax). However, this approach ignores the myriad of changes in resistance that occur before and after the TERMax data point. Herein, we utilize polynomial curve fitting on experimentally generated ECIS data, thus allowing for comparing ECIS experiments by examining the mean polynomial coefficients between groups. We show that polynomial curves accurately fit a variety of ECIS data, and that concordance between TERMax and coefficient analysis varies by type of stimulus, suggesting that TERMax differences may not always correlate with a significant difference in the overall shape of the ECIS profile. Lastly, we identify factors that impact coefficient values obtained in our analyses, including the length of time devoted to baseline measurements before addition of stimuli. Polynomial coefficient analysis is another tool that can be used for more comprehensive interrogation of ECIS data to better understand the biological underpinnings that lead to changes in barrier dysfunction in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bi, Jiacheng</author><author>Cheng, Chen</author><author>Zheng, Chaoyue</author><author>Huang, Chen</author><author>Zheng, Xiaohu</author><author>Wan, Xiaochun</author><author>Chen, Youhai H.</author><author>Tian, Zhigang</author><author>Sun, Haoyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TIPE2 is a checkpoint of natural killer cell maturation and antitumor immunity</title><secondary-title>Science Advances</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science Advances</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>38</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/sciadv.abi6515</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TIPE2 is a checkpoint of natural killer cell maturation and antitumor immunity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fsciadv.abi6515</url></web-urls></urls><label>CP96;Proliferation</label><abstract>The maturation process of NK cells determines their functionality during which IL-15 plays a critical role. However, very few checkpoints specifically targeting this process have been discovered. Here, we report that TIPE2 expression gradually increased during NK cell ontogenesis correlating to their maturation stages in both mice and humans. NK-specific TIPE2 deficiency increased mature NK cells in mice, and these TIPE2-deficient NK cells exhibited enhanced activation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-γ production upon stimulation and enhanced response to IL-15 for maturation. Moreover, TIPE2 suppressed IL-15-triggered mTOR activity in both human and murine NK cells. Consequently, blocking mTOR constrained the effect of TIPE2 deficiency on NK cell maturation in response to IL-15. Last, NK-specific TIPE2-deficient mice were resistant to tumor growth in vivo. Our results uncover a potent checkpoint in NK cell maturation and antitumor immunity in both mice and humans, suggesting a promising approach of targeting TIPE2 for NK cell-based immunotherapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, Huangheng</author><author>Liao, Yixiang</author><author>Yan, Youji</author><author>He, Zhiwen</author><author>Zhou, Jiajie</author><author>Wang, Xinghuan</author><author>Peng, Jianping</author><author>Li, Shangze</author><author>Liu, Tao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BRCC3 Promotes Tumorigenesis of Bladder Cancer by Activating the NF-κB Signaling Pathway Through Targeting TRAF2</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>BRCC3</keyword><keyword>NF-kB</keyword><keyword>TRAF2</keyword><keyword>bladder cancer</keyword><keyword>tumorigenesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcell.2021.720349</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRCC3 Promotes Tumorigenesis of Bladder Cancer by Activating the NF-κB Signaling Pathway Through Targeting TRAF2.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Growth;Proliferation</label><abstract>NF-κB signaling is very important in cancers. However, the role of BRCC3-associated NF-κB signaling activation in bladder cancer remains to be characterized. Western blotting and IHC of tissue microarray were used to confirm the abnormal expression of BRCC3 in bladder cancer. Growth curve, colony formation, soft agar assay and Xenograft model were performed to identify the role of BRCC3 over-expression or knock-out in bladder cancer. Further, RNA-Seq and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify the down-stream signaling pathway. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence confocal assay were performed to verify the precise target of BRCC3. Here, we found that high expression of BRCC3 promoted tumorigenesis through targeting the TRAF2 protein. BRCC3 expression is up-regulated in bladder cancer patients which indicates a negative prognosis. By in vitro and in vivo assays, we found genetic BRCC3 ablation markedly blocks proliferation, viability and migration of bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, RNA-Seq analysis shows that NF-κB signaling is down-regulated in BRCC3-deficient cells. BRCC3 binds to and synergizes with TRAF2 to activate NF-κB signaling. Our results indicate that high BRCC3 expression activates NF-κB signaling by targeting TRAF2 for activation, which in turn facilitates tumorigenesis in bladder cancer. This finding points to BRCC3 as a potential target in bladder cancer patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roig-carles, David</author><author>Willms, Eduard</author><author>Fontijn, Ruud D</author><author>Martinez-pacheco, Sarai</author><author>Mäger, Imre</author><author>Vries, Helga E De</author><author>Hirst, Mark</author><author>Sharrack, Basil</author><author>Male, David K</author><author>Hawkes, Cheryl A</author><author>Romero, Ignacio A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Induce Cerebrovascular Dysfunction in Inflammation</title><secondary-title>Pharmaceutics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmaceutics</full-title></periodical><pages>1525</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>blood–brain barrier</keyword><keyword>cell-to-cell communication</keyword><keyword>exosomes</keyword><keyword>extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>neuroinflammation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/pharmaceutics13091525</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Induce Cerebrovascular Dysfunction in Inflammation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fpharmaceutics13091525</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a key hallmark in the pathology of many neuroinflammatory disorders. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-enclosed carriers of molecular cargo that are involved in cell-to-cell communication. Circulating endothelial EVs are increased in the plasma of patients with neurological disorders, and immune cell-derived EVs are known to modulate cerebrovascular functions. However, little is known about whether brain endothelial cell (BEC)-derived EVs themselves contribute to BBB dysfunction. Human cerebral microvascular cells (hCMEC/D3) were treated with TNFα and IFNy, and the EVs were isolated and characterised. The effect of EVs on BBB transendothelial resistance (TEER) and leukocyte adhesion in hCMEC/D3 cells was measured by electric substrate cell-substrate impedance sensing and the flow-based T-cell adhesion assay. EV-induced molecular changes in recipient hCMEC/D3 cells were analysed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. A stimulation of naïve hCMEC/D3 cells with small EVs (sEVs) reduced the TEER and increased the shear-resistant T-cell adhesion. The levels of microRNA-155, VCAM1 and ICAM1 were increased in sEV-treated hCMEC/D3 cells. Blocking the expression of VCAM1, but not of ICAM1, prevented sEV-mediated T-cell adhesion to brain endothelia. These results suggest that sEVs derived from inflamed BECs promote cerebrovascular dysfunction. These findings may provide new insights into the mechanisms involving neuroinflammatory disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strickland, Jaimie M</author><author>Wisnieski, Lauren</author><author>Mavangira, Vengai</author><author>Sordillo, Lorraine M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serum Vitamin D Is Associated with Antioxidant Potential in Peri-Parturient Cows</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants</full-title></periodical><pages>1420</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>dairy cows</keyword><keyword>oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>vitamin d</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/antiox10091420</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Serum Vitamin D Is Associated with Antioxidant Potential in Peri-Parturient Cows.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fantiox10091420</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Dairy cows experience increased oxidative stress during periods of transition such as at the cessation of lactation and around the periparturient period, thus increasing disease risk. Despite routine supplementation of transition cow diets with certain vitamins in an attempt to mitigate oxidative stress, there is no currently available data directly linking vitamin supplementation with antioxidant potential (AOP) in transition cows. The objective of this study was to determine the association between serum vitamins and biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy cows. Blood samples were collected from 240 cows at dry off (DO), close up (CU), and 2–10 days post-calving (DIM2-10). Blood samples were analyzed for vitamins (A, D, E), β-carotene, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and AOP. Spearman correlations and mixed linear regression models were used to assess associations between vitamins and measures of oxidant status. Vitamin D concentrations were positively associated with AOP at the CU and DIM2-10. Based on the positive association with AOP, additional in-vitro studies were conducted that showed vitamin D mitigated barrier integrity loss in endothelial cells during oxidative stress. These results indicate for the first time that vitamin D may have a role in promoting antioxidant potential in transition dairy cows.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karoor, Vijaya</author><author>Strassheim, Derek</author><author>Sullivan, Timothy</author><author>Verin, Alexander</author><author>Umapathy, Nagavedi S</author><author>Dempsey, Edward C</author><author>Frank, Daniel N</author><author>Stenmark, Kurt R</author><author>Gerasimovskaya, Evgenia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Short-Chain Fatty Acid Butyrate Attenuates Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling and Inflammation in Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>HDAC inhibitors</keyword><keyword>butyrate</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>protein acetylation</keyword><keyword>pulmonary hypertension</keyword><keyword>vascular permeability</keyword><keyword>vascular remodeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><isbn>1303724561</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22189916</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Short-Chain Fatty Acid Butyrate Attenuates Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling and Inflammation in Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms22189916</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive cardiovascular disorder in which local vascular inflammation leads to increased pulmonary vascular remodeling and ultimately to right heart failure. The HDAC inhibitor butyrate, a product of microbial fermentation, is protective in inflammatory intestinal diseases, but little is known regarding its effect on extraintestinal diseases, such as PH. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that butyrate is protective in a Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat model of hypoxic PH. Treatment with butyrate (220 mg/kg intake) prevented hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), hypoxia-induced increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), pulmonary vascular remodeling, and permeability. A reversal effect of butyrate (2200 mg/kg intake) was observed on elevated RVH. Butyrate treatment also increased the acetylation of histone H3, 25–34 kDa, and 34–50 kDa proteins in the total lung lysates of butyrate-treated animals. In addition, butyrate decreased hypoxia-induced accumulation of alveolar (mostly CD68+) and interstitial (CD68+ and CD163+) lung macrophages. Analysis of cytokine profiles in lung tissue lysates showed a hypoxia-induced upregulation of TIMP-1, CINC-1, and Fractalkine and downregulation of soluble ICAM (sICAM). The expression of Fractalkine and VEGFα, but not CINC-1, TIMP-1, and sICAM was downregulated by butyrate. In rat microvascular endothelial cells (RMVEC), butyrate (1 mM, 2 and 24 h) exhibited a protective effect against TNFα- and LPS-induced barrier disruption. Butyrate (1 mM, 24 h) also upregulated tight junctional proteins (occludin, cingulin, claudin-1) and increased the acetylation of histone H3 but not α-tubulin. These findings provide evidence of the protective effect of butyrate on hypoxic PH and suggest its potential use as a complementary treatment for PH and other cardiovascular diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colamonici, Marco A.</author><author>Epshtein, Yulia</author><author>Chen, Weiguo</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Haloperidol Attenuates Lung Endothelial Cell Permeability In Vitro and In Vivo</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>2186</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>claudin-5</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>haloperidol</keyword><keyword>vascular permeability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells10092186</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Haloperidol Attenuates Lung Endothelial Cell Permeability In Vitro and In Vivo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells10092186</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>We previously reported that claudin-5, a tight junctional protein, mediates lung vascular permeability in a murine model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recently, it has been reported that haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, dose-dependently increases expression of claudin-5 in vitro and in vivo, in brain endothelium. Notably, claudin-5 is highly expressed in both brain and lung tissues. However, the effects of haloperidol on EC barrier function are unknown. We hypothesized that haloperidol increases lung EC claudin-5 expression and attenuates agonist-induced lung EC barrier disruption. Human pulmonary artery ECs were pretreated with haloperidol at variable concentrations (0.1–10 μM) for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for claudin-5, in addition to occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), two other tight junctional proteins. To assess effects on barrier function, EC monolayers were pretreated for 24 h with haloperidol (10 µM) or vehicle prior to treatment with thrombin (1 U/mL), with measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) recorded as a real-time assessment of barrier integrity. In separate experiments, EC monolayers grown in Transwell inserts were pretreated with haloperidol (10 µM) prior to stimulation with thrombin (1 U/mL, 1 h) and measurement of FITC-dextran flux. Haloperidol significantly increased claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 expression levels. Measurements of TER and FITC-dextran Transwell flux confirmed a significant attenuation of thrombin-induced barrier disruption associated with haloperidol treatment. Finally, mice pretreated with haloperidol (4 mg/kg, IP) prior to the intratracheal administration of LPS (1.25 mg/kg, 16 h) had increased lung claudin-5 expression with decreased lung injury as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein content, total cell counts, and inflammatory cytokines, in addition to lung histology. Our data confirm that haloperidol results in increased claudin-5 expression levels and demonstrates lung vascular-protective effects both in vitro and in vivo in a murine ALI model. These findings suggest that haloperidol may represent a novel therapy for the prevention or treatment of ALI and warrants further investigation in this context.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Felix, Rute Castelo</author><author>Anjos, Liliana</author><author>Costa, Rita Alves</author><author>Letsiou, Sophia</author><author>Power, Deborah Mary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cartilage Acidic Protein a Novel Therapeutic Factor to Improve Skin Damage Repair ?</title><secondary-title>Marine Drugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Drugs</full-title></periodical><pages>541</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>electric cell impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>fish skin fibroblast</keyword><keyword>scratch assay</keyword><keyword>vertebrate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/md19100541</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cartilage Acidic Protein a Novel Therapeutic Factor to Improve Skin Damage Repair.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/md19100541</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Fish skin has been gaining attention due to its efficacy as a human-wound-treatment product and to identify factors promoting its enhanced action. Skin fibroblasts have a central role in maintaining skin integrity and secrete extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins, growth factors and cytokines to rapidly repair lesions and prevent further damage or infection. The effects on scratch repair of the ubiquitous but poorly characterized ECM protein, cartilage acidic protein 1 (CRTAC1), from piscine and human sources were compared using a zebrafish SJD.1 primary fibroblast cell line. A classic in vitro cell scratch assay, immunofluorescence, biosensor and gene expression analysis were used. Our results demonstrated that the duplicate sea bass Crtac1a and Crtac1b proteins and human CRTAC-1A all promoted SJD.1 primary fibroblast migration in a classic scratch assay and in an electric cell impedance sensing assay. The immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CRTAC1 enhanced cell migration was most likely caused by actin-driven cytoskeletal changes and the cellular transcriptional response was most affected in the early stage (6 h) of scratch repair. In summary, our results suggest that CRTAC1 may be an important factor in fish skin promoting damage repair.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yueru</author><author>Baccouche, Basma</author><author>Olayinka, Olamide</author><author>Serikbaeva, Anara</author><author>Kazlauskas, Andrius</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Role of the Wnt Pathway in VEGF/Anti-VEGF-Dependent Control of the Endothelial Cell Barrier</title><secondary-title>Investigative Opthalmology &amp; Visual Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative Opthalmology &amp; Visual Science</full-title></periodical><pages>17</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.62.12.17</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Role of the Wnt Pathway in VEGF Anti-VEGF-Dependent Control of the Endothelial Cell Barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.62.12.17</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Purpose: Investigate the contribution of the Wnt pathway to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/anti-VEGF-mediated control of endothelial cell permeability. Methods: High glucose-treated primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were exposed to either VEGF, or VEGF and then anti-VEGF. Changes in gene expression were assayed by RNAseq and qRT-PCR. Permeability was monitored by electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Approaches to activate the Wnt pathway included treatment with LiCl and overexpression of constitutively activated β-catenin. β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity was monitored in HRECs stably expressing a TCF/LEF-driven reporter. Results: VEGF/anti-VEGF altered expression of genes encoding many members of the Wnt pathway. A subset of these genes was regulated in a way that is likely to contribute to control of the endothelial cell barrier. Namely, the VEGF-induced alteration of expression of such genes was reversed by anti-VEGF, and such adjustments occurred at times corresponding to changes in barrier function. While pharmacological and molecular approaches to activate the Wnt pathway had no effect on basal permeability, they suppressed VEGF-induced relaxation. Furthermore, anti-VEGF-mediated restoration of barrier function was unaffected by activation of the Wnt pathway. Conclusions: VEGF/anti-VEGF engages multiple members of the Wnt pathway, and activating this pathway enforces the endothelial barrier by attenuating VEGF-induced relaxation. These data suggest that FDA-approved agents such as LiCl may be an adjuvant to anti-VEGF therapy for patients afflicted with blinding conditions including diabetic retinopathy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Narayanan, Manojkumar</author><author>Kulkarni, Rutuja</author><author>Jiang, Shuxian</author><author>Kashanchi, Fatah</author><author>Prasad, Anil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cocaine augments neuro-inflammation via modulating extracellular vesicle release in HIV-1 infected immune cells</title><secondary-title>Retrovirology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Retrovirology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cocaine</keyword><keyword>Extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>HIV-1</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>cocaine</keyword><keyword>extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>hiv-1</keyword><keyword>macrophages</keyword><keyword>neuroinflammation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12977-021-00570-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cocaine augments neuro-inflammation via modulating extracellular vesicle release in HIV-1 infected immune cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12977-021-00570-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Background Extracellular Vesicles (EV) recently have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 syndromes, including neuroinflammation and HIV-1 associated neurological disorder (HAND). Cocaine, an illicit stimulant drug used worldwide is known to exacerbate these HIV-1 associated neurological syndromes. However, the effects of cocaine on EV biogenesis and roles of EVs in enhancing HIV-1 pathogenesis are not yet well defined. Results Here, we investigated the effects of cocaine on EV biogenesis and release in HIV-1 infected immune cells and explored their roles in elicitation of neuroinflammation. We found that cocaine significantly augmented the release of EVs from uninfected and HIV-1 infected T-cells, DCs and macrophages. Further analysis of the molecular components of EVs revealed enhanced expression of adhesion molecules integrin β1 and LFA-1 in those EVs derived from cocaine treated cells. Intriguingly, in EVs derived from HIV-1 infected cells, cocaine treatment significantly increased the levels of viral genes in EVs released from macrophages and DCs, but not in T-cells. Exploring the molecular mechanism to account for this, we found that DCs and macrophages showed enhanced expression of the cocaine receptor Sigma 1-Receptor compared to T-cells. In addition, we found that cocaine significantly altered the integrity of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in HIV-1 infected macrophages and DCs compared to untreated HIV-1 infected cells. Characterizing further the molecular mechanisms involved in how cocaine increased EV release, we found that cocaine decreased the expression of the interferon-inducible protein BST-2; this resulted in altered trafficking of intracellular virus containing vesicles and EV biogenesis and release. We also observed EVs released from cocaine treated HIV-1 infected macrophages and DCs enhanced HIV-1 trans-infection to T-cells compared to those from untreated and HIV-1 infected cells. These EVs triggered release of proinflammatory cytokines in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and altered monolayer integrity. Conclusions Taken together, our results provide a novel mechanism which helps to elucidate the enhanced prevalence of neurological disorders in cocaine using HIV-1 infected individuals and offers insights into developing novel therapeutic strategies against HAND in these hosts.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, Song-Song</author><author>Zou, Qing-Cui</author><author>Xiong, Wen-Jing</author><author>Cui, Ning-Yi</author><author>Wang, Ke</author><author>Liu, Hao-Xuan</author><author>Lou, Wen-Juan</author><author>Higazy, Doaa</author><author>Zhang, Ya-Ge</author><author>Cui, Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell-Derived HMGB1 Facilitates Monocyte Adhesion and Transmigration to Promote JEV Neuroinvasion</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>August</issue><keywords><keyword>HMGB1</keyword><keyword>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)</keyword><keyword>adhesion</keyword><keyword>frontiers in cellular and</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>hmgb1</keyword><keyword>infection microbiology</keyword><keyword>japanese encephalitis virus</keyword><keyword>jev</keyword><keyword>monocyte</keyword><keyword>neuroinvasion</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>transmigration</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcimb.2021.701820</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell-Derived HMGB1 Facilitates Monocyte Adhesion and Transmigration to Promote JEV Neuroinvasion.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffcimb.2021.701820</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) induces high morbidity and mortality, including potentially permanent neurological sequelae. However, the mechanisms by which viruses cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invade into the central nervous system (CNS) remain unclear. Here, we show that extracellular HMGB1 facilitates immune cell transmigration. Furthermore, the migration of immune cells into the CNS dramatically increases during JEV infection which may enhance viral clearance, but paradoxically expedite the onset of Japanese encephalitis (JE). In this study, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were utilized for the detection of HMGB1 release, and leucocyte, adhesion, and the integrity of the BBB in vitro . Genetically modified JEV-expressing EGFP (EGFP-JEV) and the BBB model were established to trace JEV-infected immune cell transmigration, which mimics the process of viral neuroinfection. We find that JEV causes HMGB1 release from BMECs while increasing adhesion molecules. Recombinant HMGB1 enhances leukocyte-endothelium adhesion, facilitating JEV-infected monocyte transmigration across endothelia. Thus, JEV successfully utilizes infected monocytes to spread into the brain, expanding inside of the brain, and leading to the acceleration of JE onset, which was facilitated by HMGB1. HMGB1-promoted monocyte transmigration may represent the mechanism of JEV neuroinvasion, revealing potential therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gheorghiu, Mihaela</author><author>Polonschii, Cristina</author><author>Popescu, Octavian</author><author>Gheorghiu, Eugen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Advanced optogenetic-based biosensing and related biomaterials</title><secondary-title>Materials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Materials</full-title></periodical><pages>5-12</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell dynamics</keyword><keyword>Cell-based biosensors</keyword><keyword>Optogenetic (light-responsive) biomaterials</keyword><keyword>Optogenetic control</keyword><keyword>Time-lapse multiparametric assays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ma14154151</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Advanced Optogenetic-Based Biosensing and Related Biomaterials.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fma14154151</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review;Theory</label><abstract>The ability to stimulate mammalian cells with light, brought along by optogenetic control, has significantly broadened our understanding of electrically excitable tissues. Backed by advanced (bio)materials, it has recently paved the way towards novel biosensing concepts supporting bio-analytics applications transversal to the main biomedical stream. The advancements concerning enabling biomaterials and related novel biosensing concepts involving optogenetics are reviewed with particular focus on the use of engineered cells for cell-based sensing platforms and the available toolbox (from mere actuators and reporters to novel multifunctional opto-chemogenetic tools) for optogenetic-enabled real-time cellular diagnostics and biosensor development. The key advantages of these modified cell-based biosensors concern both significantly faster (minutes instead of hours) and higher sensitivity detection of low concentrations of bioactive/toxic analytes (below the threshold concentrations in classical cellular sensors) as well as improved standardization as warranted by unified analytic platforms. These novel multimodal functional electro-optical label-free assays are reviewed among the key elements for optogenetic-based biosensing standardization.

Porcine bacterial pathogens, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Glaesserella (Haemophilus) parasuis, and Pasteurella multocida, breach this barrier to lead to local or systematic infections. Here, we demonstrated that respiratory bacterial pathogen infection disrupted the airway epithelial intercellular junction protein, E-cadherin, thus contributing to impaired epithelial cell integrity. E-cadherin knocking-out in newborn pig tracheal cells via CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology confirmed that E-cadherin was sufficient to suppress the paracellular transmigration of these porcine respiratory bacterial pathogens, including G. parasuis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, and B. bronchiseptica. The E-cadherin ectodomain cleavage by these pathogens was probably attributed to bacterial HtrA/DegQ protease, but not host HtrA1, MMP7 and ADAM10, and the prominent proteolytic activity was further confirmed by a serine-to-alanine substitution mutation in the active center of HtrA/DegQ protein. Moreover, deletion of the htrA gene in G. parasuis led to severe defects in E-cadherin ectodomain cleavage, cell adherence and paracellular transmigration in vitro, as well as bacterial breaking through the tracheal epithelial cells, systemic invasion and dissemination in vivo. This common pathogenic mechanism shared by other porcine respiratory bacterial pathogens explains how these bacterial pathogens destroy the airway epithelial cell barriers and proliferate in respiratory mucosal surface or other systemic tissues.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Young, Tamara L.</author><author>Mostovenko, Ekaterina</author><author>Denson, Jesse L.</author><author>Begay, Jessica G.</author><author>Lucas, Selita N.</author><author>Herbert, Guy</author><author>Zychowski, Katherine</author><author>Hunter, Russell</author><author>Salazar, Raul</author><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Fraser, Kelly</author><author>Erdely, Aaron</author><author>Ottens, Andrew K.</author><author>Campen, Matthew J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pulmonary delivery of the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat diminishes multiwalled carbon nanotube-induced circulating bioactivity without reducing pulmonary inflammation</title><secondary-title>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomarker</keyword><keyword>Carbon nanotubes</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Matrix metalloproteinase</keyword><keyword>Multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)</keyword><keyword>Nanomaterials</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Serum-bioactivity</keyword><keyword>carbon nanotubes</keyword><keyword>matrix</keyword><keyword>multiwall carbon nanotube</keyword><keyword>mwcnt</keyword><keyword>nanomaterials</keyword><keyword>nanoparticles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12989-021-00427-w</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pulmonary delivery of the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat diminishes multiwalled carbon nanotube-induced circulating bioactivity without reducing pulmonary inflammation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-021-00427-w</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are an increasingly utilized engineered nanomaterial that pose the potential for signifcant risk of exposure-related health outcomes. The mechanism(s) underlying MWCNTinduced toxicity to extrapulmonary sites are still being defned. MWCNT-induced serum-borne bioactivity appears to dysregulate systemic endothelial cell function. The serum compositional changes after MWCNT exposure have been identifed as a surge of fragmented endogenous peptides, likely derived from matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. In the present study, we utilize a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, Marimastat, along with a previously described oropharyngeal aspiration model of MWCNT administration to investigate the role of MMPs in MWCNT-derived serum peptide generation and endothelial bioactivity. Results: C57BL/6 mice were treated with Marimastat or vehicle by oropharyngeal aspiration 1 h prior to MWCNT treatment. Pulmonary neutrophil infltration and total bronchoalveolar lavage fuid protein increased independent of MMP blockade. The lung cytokine profle similarly increased following MWCNT exposure for major infammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), with minimal impact from MMP inhibition. However, serum peptidomic analysis revealed diferential peptide compositional profles, with MMP blockade abrogating MWCNT-derived serum peptide fragments. The serum, in turn, exhibited diferential potency in terms of infammatory bioactivity when incubated with primary murine cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Serum from MWCNT-treated mice led to infammatory responses in endothelial cells that were signifcantly blunted with serum from Marimastat-treated mice. Conclusions: Thus, MWCNT exposure induced pulmonary infammation that was largely independent of MMP activity but generated circulating bioactive peptides through predominantly MMP-dependent pathways. This MWCNT-induced lung-derived bioactivity caused pathological consequences of endothelial infammation and barrier disruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stierschneider, Anna</author><author>Grünstäudl, Petra</author><author>Colleselli, Katrin</author><author>Atzler, Josef</author><author>Klein, Christian T</author><author>Hundsberger, Harald</author><author>Wiesner, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Light-Inducible Spatio-Temporal Control of TLR4 and NF- κ B-Gluc Reporter in Human Pancreatic Cell Line</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>9232</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22179232</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Light-Inducible Spatio-Temporal Control of TLR4 and NF-κB-Gluc Reporter in Human Pancreatic Cell Line.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms22179232</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Proliferation</label><abstract>Augmented Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression was found in nearly 70% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is correlated with increased tumorigenesis and progression. In this study, we engineered a new light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain-based optogenetic cell line (opto-TLR4 PANC-1) that enables time-resolved activation of the NF-κB and extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 signalling pathway upon blue light-sensitive homodimerisation of the TLR4-LOV fusion protein. Continuous stimulation with light indicated strong p65 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation even after 24 h, whereas brief light exposure peaked at 8 h and reached the ground level 24 h post-illumination. The cell line further allows a voltage-dependent TLR4 activation, which can be continuously monitored, turned on by light or off in the dark. Using this cell line, we performed different phenotypic cell-based assays with 2D and 3D cultures, with the aim of controlling cellular activity with spatial and temporal precision. Light exposure enhanced cell attachment, the formation and extension of invadopodia, and cell migration in 3D spheroid cultures, but no significant changes in proliferation or viability could be detected. We conclude that the opto-TLR4 PANC-1 cell line is an ideal tool for investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms of TLR4, thereby providing strategies for new therapeutic options.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xueying</author><author>Wang, Fei</author><author>Lin, Lin</author><author>Liang, Wan</author><author>Liu, Songtao</author><author>Hua, Lin</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Peng, Zhong</author><author>Wu, Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptome Differences in Pig Tracheal Epithelial Cells in Response to Pasteurella Multocida Infection</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>August</issue><keywords><keyword>Pasteurella multocida</keyword><keyword>RNA-Seq</keyword><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>dysfunction</keyword><keyword>frontiers in veterinary science</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>new-born pig tracheal epithelial</keyword><keyword>new-born pig tracheal epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>pasteurella multocida</keyword><keyword>respiratory epithelial barriers</keyword><keyword>rna-seq</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fvets.2021.682514</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Transcriptome Differences in Pig Tracheal Epithelial Cells in Response to Pasteurella Multocida Infection.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffvets.2021.682514</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity;TEER</label><abstract>Pasteurella multocida generally colonizes mammalian/bird respiratory tracts and mainly causes respiratory disorders in both humans and animals. To date, the effects of P. multocida infection on the respiratory epithelial barriers and molecules in host respiratory epithelial cells in their response to P. multocida infection are still not well-known. In this study, we used newborn pig tracheal epithelial (NPTr) cells as an in vitro model to investigate the effect of P. multocida infection on host respiratory epithelial barriers. By detecting the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of NPTr cells and the expression of several known molecules associated with cell adherens and junctions, we found that P. multocida infection disrupted the barrier functions of NPTr cells. By performing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we determined 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) encoding gene VEGFA , which participated in biological processes (GO:0034330, GO:0045216, and GO:0098609) closely related to epithelial adhesion and barrier functions.

Although tissue kallikrein (TK) has used in the treatment of stroke in China, the role of TK in modulating BBB permeability is not clear. Methods: We investigated the effect of different doses of TK on BBB by in vivo assessments of Evans blue (EB) and sodium-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) leakage and in vitro assessments of the integrity of BBB and monolayers of microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). The expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and bradykinin receptormediated signaling in BMVECs was detected. Results: A significant increase in BBB permeability was observed in the mice treated with high dose of TK. However, standard and medium doses of TK could only enable sodiumFITC to enter the brain. The result of in vitro study indicated that high-doses of TK, but not standard and medium-dose of TK, reduced normal BBB integrity accompanied by a decreased expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), upregulated the mRNA levels of bradykinin 2 receptor (B2R) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the abundance of B2R. Moreover, standard-dose of TK exacerbated lipopolysaccharide-induced BBB hyperpermeability, upregulated the mRNA levels of bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increased the abundance of B1R and reduced the abundance of ZO-1; these effects were inhibited by TK inhibitor. Conclusion: TK can disrupt tight junctions and increase normal BBB permeability via B2Rdependent eNOS signaling pathway, aggravate impairment of BBB via B1R-dependent iNOS signaling pathway, and consequently serve as a useful adjunctive treatment for enhancing the efficacy of other neurotherapeutics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ronja, Anna</author><author>Binder, Dorothea</author><author>Spiess, Andrej-nikolai</author><author>Pfaffl, Michael W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling and Differential Quantification of Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Growth Curves</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><pages>5286</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>adherent cells</keyword><keyword>area under the curve</keyword><keyword>auc</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>four-</keyword><keyword>impedance vs</keyword><keyword>ipec-j2</keyword><keyword>parameter logistic</keyword><keyword>segmented regression</keyword><keyword>smoothing spline</keyword><keyword>time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s21165286</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Modelling and Differential Quantification of Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Growth Curves.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fs21165286</url></web-urls></urls><label>Modeling;Proliferation;Theory</label><abstract>Measurement of cell surface coverage has become a common technique for the assessment of growth behavior of cells. As an indirect measurement method, this can be accomplished by monitoring changes in electrode impedance, which constitutes the basis of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). ECIS typically yields growth curves where impedance is plotted against time, and changes in single cell growth behavior or cell proliferation can be displayed without significantly impacting cell physiology. To provide better comparability of ECIS curves in different experimental settings, we developed a large toolset of R scripts for their transformation and quantification. They allow importing growth curves generated by ECIS systems, edit, transform, graph and analyze them while delivering quantitative data extracted from reference points on the curve. Quantification is implemented through three different curve fit algorithms (smoothing spline, logistic model, segmented regression). From the obtained models, curve reference points such as the first derivative maximum, segmentation knots and area under the curve are then extracted. The scripts were tested for general applicability in real-life cell culture experiments on partly anonymized cell lines, a calibration setup with a cell dilution series of impedance versus seeded cell number and finally IPEC-J2 cells treated with 1% and 5% ethanol.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Kyle H</author><author>Murphy, Hayley A</author><author>Chapman, Heather</author><author>George, Eric M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syncytialization alters the extracellular matrix and barrier function of placental trophoblasts</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpcell.00177.2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00177.2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The human placenta is of vital importance for proper nutrient and waste exchange, immune regulation, and overall fetal health and growth. Specifically, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, which extends outward from the placental chorionic villi into maternal blood, acts on a molecular level to regulate and maintain this barrier. Importantly, placental barrier dysfunction has been linked to diseases of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. To help facilitate our understanding of the interface, and develop therapeutics to repair or prevent dysfunction of the placental barrier, in vitro models of the placental ECM would be of great value. In this study we aimed to characterize the ECM of an in vitro model of the placental barrier using syncytialized BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. Syncytialization caused a marked change in syndecans, integral proteoglycans of the ECM, which matched observations of in vivo placental ECM. Syndecan-1 expression increased greatly and predominated the other variants. Barrier function of the ECM, as measured by electrical impedance, increased significantly during and after syncytialization, while the ability of THP-1 monocytes to adhere to syncytialized BeWos was greatly reduced compared to non-syncytialized controls. Furthermore, ECIS measurements indicated that ECM degradation with MMP-9, but not heparanase, decreased barrier function. This decrease in ECIS-measured barrier function was not associated with any changes in THP-1 adherence to syncytialized BeWos treated with heparanase or MMP9. Thus, syncytialization of BeWos provides a physiologically accurate placental ECM with a barrier function matching that seen in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campagna, Roberto</author><author>Mateuszuk, Łukasz</author><author>Wojnar-Lason, Kamila</author><author>Kaczara, Patrycja</author><author>Tworzydło, Anna</author><author>Kij, Agnieszka</author><author>Bujok, Robert</author><author>Mlynarski, Jacek</author><author>Wang, Yu</author><author>Sartini, Davide</author><author>Emanuelli, Monica</author><author>Chlopicki, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in endothelium protects against oxidant stress-induced endothelial injury</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Cell Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Cell Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>1868</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>NNMT</keyword><keyword>Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34153425</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbamcr.2021.119082</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2021.119082</url></web-urls></urls><label>Proliferation</label><abstract>Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT, EC 2.1.1.1.) plays an important role in the growth of many different tumours and is also involved in various non-neoplastic disorders. However, the presence and role of NNMT in the endothelium has yet to be specifically explored. Here, we characterized the functional activity of NNMT in the endothelium and tested whether NNMT regulates endothelial cell viability. NNMT in endothelial cells (HAEC, HMEC-1 and EA.hy926) was inhibited using two approaches: pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme by NNMT inhibitors (5-amino-1-methylquinoline – 5MQ and 6-methoxynicotinamide – JBSF-88) or by shRNA-mediated silencing. Functional inhibition of NNMT was confirmed by LC/MS/MS-based analysis of impaired MNA production. The effects of NNMT inhibition on cellular viability were analyzed in both the absence and presence of menadione. Our results revealed that all studied endothelial lines express relatively high levels of functionally active NNMT compared with cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Although the aldehyde oxidase 1 enzyme was also expressed in the endothelium, the further metabolites of N1-methylnicotinamide (N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide) generated by this enzyme were not detected, suggesting that endothelial NNMT-derived MNA was not subsequently metabolized in the endothelium by aldehyde oxidase 1. Menadione induced a concentration-dependent decrease in endothelial viability as evidenced by a decrease in cell number that was associated with the upregulation of NNMT and SIRT1 expression in the nucleus in viable cells. The suppression of the NNMT activity either by NNMT inhibitors or shRNA-based silencing significantly decreased the endothelial cell viability in response to menadione. Furthermore, NNMT inhibition resulted in nuclear SIRT1 expression downregulation and upregulation of the phosphorylated form of SIRT1 on Ser47. In conclusion, our results suggest that the endothelial nuclear NNMT/SIRT1 pathway exerts a cytoprotective role that safeguards endothelial cell viability under oxidant stress insult.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Long</author><author>Shi, Fukun</author><author>Guo, Jinsong</author><author>Wang, Qun</author><author>Kolb, Juergen F.</author><author>Wang, Weidong</author><author>Wu, Xiaodong</author><author>Zhuang, Jie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedimetric characterization of normal and cancer cell responses after nano-pulse stimulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>cell-to-substrate distance</keyword><keyword>impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>nano-pulse stimulation</keyword><keyword>paracellular distance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1361-6463/abdd69</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/abdd69/meta?casa_token=wGsTZkbRT9IAAAAA:fQvfauoOSVydxDOJy1RprHZF2GjSWwtFgw2WWzk2algLxfyo2qwO5hETS7FIcrWuqy8B4tDoLsC_x6UyH0Te</url></web-urls></urls><label>Electroporation</label><abstract>This work aimed to investigate the potential selective effects of nano-pulse stimulation (NPS) on adherent cancer and normal cells using impedance spectroscopy. A constant phase element was used to separate the impedance of electrode polarization from the overall measured impedance. Its amplitude was further related to cell-to-substrate distance, D cs, which describes the gap between cells and substrate. Dielectric properties of subcellular components were extracted based on a single-shell dielectric model for individual cells and were consequently used to calculate the induced transmembrane potentials (TMPs). Afterward, a Cole-Cole model was utilized to represent the impedance of cell monolayers. The model parameter, R 0, representing resistance at low frequency, was related to the paracellular distance, D cc. Results showed that cancer cells could suffer a higher degree of electroporation than normal cells when exposed to the same NPS. This selective NPS effect was reflected by a greater decrease of the Cole model parameter, α, and larger induced TMPs for cancer cells. D cc was pulse number-dependent for both types of cells after exposure (four and eight pulses, 100 ns, 660 V). D cs showed lingering effects even 24 h after exposure to 8 ns pulses for both cancer and normal cells, suggesting that intense NPS can induce long-term changes of the cell-to-substrate interface.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Huan</author><author>Wei, Wenbin</author><author>Cao, Qi</author><author>Xu, Manman</author><author>Chen, Qichao</author><author>Lv, Yujin</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Dai, Menghong</author><author>Xu, Xiaojuan</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sialylated Lipooligosaccharide Contributes to Glaesserella parasuis Penetration of Porcine Respiratory Epithelial Barrier</title><secondary-title>ACS Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>661-671</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Glaesserella parasuis</keyword><keyword>LOS sialylation</keyword><keyword>Siglec1</keyword><keyword>TGFβ1</keyword><keyword>respiratory epithelial barrier</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33645216</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00850</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00850?ref=pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;TEER</label><abstract>Pathogens utilize various mechanisms to escape host immunological surveillance, break down different tissue barriers, and cause infection. Sialylation is an important surface modification of bacterial outer membrane components, especially the lipooligosaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. It is widely involved in multiple microbe-host interactions, such as bacterial virulence regulation, host recognition, and immune evasion. There are some sialylation modifications on the lipooligosaccharide structure of Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) virulent strains. However, the role of lipooligosaccharide sialylation modification in the process of G. parasuis infection and penetration of the porcine respiratory epithelial barrier is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of lsgB-mediated lipooligosaccharide sialylation in G. parasuis invasion of the host respiratory epithelial barrier. Specifically, G. parasuis lsgB-mediated lipooligosaccharide sialylation and sialylated-lipooligosaccharide interacted with Siglec1 on porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/21 and triggered the subsequent generation of TGFβ1 through Siglec1/Dap12/Syk/p38 signaling cascade. TGFβ1 decreased the tracheal epithelial tight junctions and the expression of extracellular adhesion molecule fibronectin, thus assisting G. parasuis invasion and entry to the respiratory epithelial barrier. Characterizing the potential effects and mechanisms of lipooligosaccharide sialylation-mediated TGFβ1 production would further expand our current knowledge on the pathogenesis of G. parasuis which will contribute to better prevention and control of G. parasuis infection in piglets.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xiao Ling</author><author>Chen, Mei Xuan</author><author>Lou, Xue Fang</author><author>Du, Yu Yin</author><author>Shu, Gao Feng</author><author>Qi, Jing</author><author>Zhu, Meng Lu</author><author>Ying, Xiao Ying</author><author>Yu, Lian</author><author>Ji, Jian Song</author><author>Du, Yong Zhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sialic acid-modified mesoporous polydopamine induces tumor vessel normalization to enhance photodynamic therapy by inhibiting VE-cadherin internalization</title><secondary-title>Chemical Engineering Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical Engineering Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>414</volume><keywords><keyword>3PO</keyword><keyword>Mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>PDT</keyword><keyword>Tumor vascular normalization</keyword><keyword>VE-cadherin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cej.2021.128743</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.128743</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Tumor hypoxia do harm to the therapeutic efficiency of photodynamic therapy (PDT) since sufficient local O2 concentration is necessary for the generation of toxic singlet O2 (1O2). Herein, a sialic acid-PEG-modified mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticle dual loaded with indocyanine green and 3PO-loaded (SPMI/3) was fabricated. Owing to the specific combination between sialic acid and E-selectin overexpressed on the inflammatory endothelial cells around tumors, SPMI/3 demonstrated a 1.39-fold higher accumulation than that of the PMI/3-treated group. After laser irradiation, SPMI/3 revealed a potent anti-tumor efficacy due to the combination therapy of PDT and photothermal therapy in the early stage of treatment. Later, thanks to the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor induced by PDT, the slowly released 3PO from SPMI/3 reduced by 65.20% endocytosis of VE-cadherin compared to the PBS group. Accordingly, SPMI/3 normalized tumor vessels by increasing laminin and pericyte coverage, contributing to the decreased vascular permeability and improved tissue hypoxia. All these improvements contributed to the normalized tumor vasculature and inhibition of metastasis. In conclusion, this finding provides a novel strategy to enhance PDT therapy via tumor vessel normalization.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koirala, Ramesh</author><author>Priest, Andrew Vae</author><author>Yen, Chi-fu</author><author>Cheah, Joleen S</author><author>Pannekoek, Willem-jan</author><author>Gloerich, Martijn</author><author>Yamada, Soichiro</author><author>Sivasankar, Sanjeevi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inside-out regulation of E-cadherin conformation and adhesion</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>1-49</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>30</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2104090118</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Cadherin cell–cell adhesion proteins play key roles in tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. Cadherin ectodomains bind in two conformations, X-dimers and strand-swap dimers, with different adhesive properties. However, the mechanisms by which cells regulate ectodomain conformation are unknown. Cadherin intracellular regions associate with several actin-binding proteins including vinculin, which are believed to tune cell–cell adhesion by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show at the single-molecule level, that vinculin association with the cadherin cytoplasmic region allosterically converts weak X-dimers into strong strand-swap dimers and that this process is mediated by myosin II–dependent changes in cytoskeletal tension. We also show that in epithelial cells, ∼70% of apical cadherins exist as strand-swap dimers while the remaining form X-dimers, providing two cadherin pools with different adhesive properties. Our results demonstrate the inside-out regulation of cadherin conformation and establish a mechanistic role for vinculin in this process.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, Erika</author><author>Xu, Fenguyn</author><author>Joffre, Jérémie</author><author>Nguyen, Nina</author><author>Wilhelmsen, Kevin</author><author>Hellman, Judith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ERK1/2 has divergent roles in LPS-induced microvascular endothelial cell cytokine production and permeability</title><secondary-title>Shock</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Shock</full-title></periodical><pages>349-356</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>LPS</keyword><keyword>NFκB</keyword><keyword>TLR4</keyword><keyword>acute inflammation</keyword><keyword>endothelial activation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>32826812</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SHK.0000000000001639</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.lww.com/shockjournal/Abstract/2021/03000/ERK1_2_Has_Divergent_Roles_in_LPS_Induced.10.aspx</url></web-urls></urls><label>Permeability</label><abstract>Endothelial cells play a major role in inflammatory responses to infection and sterile injury. Endothelial cells express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and are activated by LPS to express inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and to undergo functional changes, including increased permeability. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mediates pro-inflammatory signaling in monocytes and macrophages, but the role of ERK1/2 in LPS-induced activation of microvascular endothelial cells has not been defined. We therefore studied the role of ERK1/2 in LPS-induced inflammatory activation and permeability of primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC). Inhibition of ERK1/2 augmented LPS-induced IL-6 and vascular cell adhesion protein (VCAM-1) production by HMVEC. ERK1/2 siRNA knockdown also augmented IL-6 production by LPS-treated HMVEC. Conversely, ERK1/2 inhibition abrogated permeability and restored cell-cell junctions of LPS-treated HMVEC. Consistent with the previously described pro-inflammatory role for ERK1/2 in leukocytes, inhibition of ERK1/2 reduced LPS-induced cytokine/chemokine production by primary human monocytes. Our study identifies a complex role for ERK1/2 in TLR4-activation of HMVEC, independent of myeloid differentiation primary response gene (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) signaling pathways. The activation of ERK1/2 limits LPS-induced IL-6 production by HMVEC, while at the same time promoting HMVEC permeability. Conversely, ERK1/2 activation promotes IL-6 production by human monocytes. Our results suggest that ERK1/2 may play an important role in the nuanced regulation of endothelial cell inflammation and vascular permeability in sepsis and injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martino, Nina</author><author>Ramos, Ramon Bossardi</author><author>Lu, Shuhan</author><author>Leyden, Kara</author><author>Tomaszek, Lindsay</author><author>Sadhu, Sudeshna</author><author>Fredman, Gabrielle</author><author>Jaitovich, Ariel</author><author>Vincent, Peter A.</author><author>Adam, Alejandro P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial SOCS3 maintains homeostasis and promotes survival in endotoxemic mice</title><secondary-title>JCI Insight</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JCI Insight</full-title></periodical><pages>1-21</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>vascular biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34138760</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/jci.insight.147280</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.147280</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Permeability;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>SOCS3 is the main inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. This pathway is activated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major mediator of the cytokine storm during shock. To determine its role in the vascular response to shock, we challenged mice lacking SOCS3 in the adult endothelium (SOCS3iEKO) with a nonlethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SOCS3iEKO mice died 16–24 hours postinjection after severe kidney failure. Loss of SOCS3 led to an LPS-induced type I IFN–like program and high expression of prothrombotic and proadhesive genes. Consistently, we observed intraluminal leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil extracellular trap–osis (NETosis), as well as retinal venular leukoembolization. Notably, heterozygous mice displayed an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a gene dose effect. In vitro studies were performed to study the role of SOCS3 protein levels in the regulation of the inflammatory response. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, pulse-chase experiments showed that SOCS3 protein had a half-life less than 20 minutes. Inhibition of SOCS3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation led to protein accumulation and a stronger inhibition of IL-6 signaling and barrier function loss. Together, our data demonstrate that the regulation of SOCS3 protein levels is critical to inhibit IL-6–mediated endotheliopathy during shock and provide a promising therapeutic avenue to prevent multiorgan dysfunction through stabilization of endothelial SOCS3.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Summers, Megan E.</author><author>Richmond, Bradley W.</author><author>Kropski, Jonathan A.</author><author>Majka, Sarah A.</author><author>Bastarache, Julie A.</author><author>Hatzopoulos, Antonis K.</author><author>Bylund, Jeffery</author><author>Ghosh, Moumita</author><author>Petrache, Irina</author><author>Foronjy, Robert F.</author><author>Geraghty, Patrick</author><author>Majka, Susan M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Balanced Wnt/Dickkopf-1 signaling by mesenchymal vascular progenitor cells in the microvascular niche maintains distal lung structure and function</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>C119-C131</pages><volume>320</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33085496</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpcell.00277.2020</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00277.2020</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The well-described Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) plays a role in angiogenesis as well as in regulation of growth factor signaling cascades in pulmonary remodeling associated with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) including emphysema and fibrosis. However, the specific mechanisms by which DKK1 influences mesenchymal vascular progenitor cells (MVPCs), microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the microvascular niche have not been elucidated. In this study, we show that knockdown of DKK1 in Abcg2pos lung mouse adult tissue resident MVPCs alters lung stiffness, parenchymal collagen deposition, microvessel muscularization and density as well as loss of tissue structure in response to hypoxia exposure. To complement the in vivo mouse modeling, we also identified cell- or disease-specific responses to DKK1, in primary lung chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) MVPCs, COPD MVECs, and SMCs, supporting a paradoxical disease-specific response of cells to well-characterized factors. Cell responses to DKK1 were dose dependent and correlated with varying expressions of the DKK1 receptor, CKAP4. These data demonstrate that DKK1 expression is necessary to maintain the microvascular niche whereas its effects are context specific. They also highlight DKK1 as a regulatory candidate to understand the role of Wnt and DKK1 signaling between cells of the microvascular niche during tissue homeostasis and during the development of chronic lung diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samsonov, M.

Using both in vitro and ex vivo methods of barrier function measurement, including Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS), a TRITC-dextran Transwell permeability assay, and a FITC-dextran cardiovascular leakage protocol involving Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts, αCT1 was found to protect the endothelium from thrombin-induced breakdown in cell–cell contacts. Barrier protection was accompanied by significant remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton, characterized by a redistribution of F-actin away from the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions of the cell, towards the endothelial cell periphery, in association with alterations in cellular chiral orientation distribution. In line with observations of increased cortical F-actin, αCT1 upregulated cell–cell border localization of endothelial VE-cadherin, the tight junction protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO1), and the Gap Junction Protein (GJ) Connexin43 (Cx43). A ZO1 binding-incompetent variant of αCT1, αCT1-I, indicated that these effects on barrier function and barrier-associated proteins, were likely associated with Cx43 CT sequences retaining ability to interact with ZO1. These results implicate the Cx43 CT and its interaction with ZO1, in the regulation of endothelial barrier function, while revealing the therapeutic potential of αCT1 in the treatment of vascular edema.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colunga Biancatelli, Ruben M.

To that end, we intratracheally instilled the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1SP) in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that overexpress human ACE2 and examined signs of COVID-19-associated lung injury 72 h later. Controls included K18-hACE2 mice that received saline or the intact SP and wild-type (WT) mice that received S1SP. K18-hACE2 mice instilled with S1SP exhibited a decline in body weight, dramatically increased white blood cells and protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines in BALF and serum, histological evidence of lung injury, and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways in the lung. K18-hACE2 mice that received either saline or SP exhibited little or no evidence of lung injury. WT mice that received S1SP exhibited a milder form of COVID-19 symptoms, compared with the K18-hACE2 mice. Furthermore, S1SP, but not SP, decreased cultured human pulmonary microvascular transendothelial resistance (TER) and barrier function. This is the first demonstration of a COVID-19-like response by an essential virus-encoded protein by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. This model of COVID-19-induced ALI may assist in the investigation of new therapeutic approaches for the management of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kong, Chunli</author><author>Beukema, Martin</author><author>Wang, Min</author><author>de Haan, Bart J.</author><author>de Vos, Paul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human milk oligosaccharides and non-digestible carbohydrates prevent adhesion of specific pathogens via modulating glycosylation or inflammatory genes in intestinal epithelial cells</title><secondary-title>Food &amp; Function</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Food &amp; Function</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Royal Society of Chemistry</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/d1fo00872b</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1039/D1FO00872B</url></web-urls></urls><label>Inflammation;TEER</label><abstract>Human milk oligosaccharides 2′-FL and pectins inhibited pathogen adhesion through modulating glycosylation and inflammatory genes in intestinal epithelial cells. Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) are known to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens to the gut epithelium, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Here, the effects of 2′-FL, 3-FL, DP3–DP10, DP10–DP60 and DP30–DP60 inulins and DM7, DM55 and DM69 pectins were studied on pathogen adhesion to Caco-2 cells. As the growth phase influences virulence, E. coli ET8, E. coli LMG5862, E. coli O119, E. coli WA321, and S. enterica subsp. enterica LMG07233 from both log and stationary phases were tested. Specificity for enteric pathogens was tested by including the lung pathogen K. pneumoniae LMG20218. Expression of the cell membrane glycosylation genes of galectin and glycocalyx and inflammatory genes was studied in the presence and absence of 2′-FL or NDCs. Inhibition of pathogen adhesion was observed for 2′-FL, inulins, and pectins. Pre-incubation with 2′-FL downregulated ICAM1 , and pectins modified the glycosylation genes. In contrast, K. pneumoniae LMG20218 downregulated the inflammatory genes, but these were restored by pre-incubation with pectins, which reduced the adhesion of K. pneumoniae LMG20218. In addition, DM69 pectin significantly upregulated the inflammatory genes. 2′-FL and pectins but not inulins inhibited pathogen adhesion to the gut epithelial Caco-2 cells through changing the cell membrane glycosylation and inflammatory genes, but the effects were molecule-, pathogen-, and growth phase-dependent.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fujiwara-Sumiyoshi, Shiori</author><author>Ueda, Yuhki</author><author>Fujikawa, Mika</author><author>Osaki, Miho</author><author>Yamanaka, Naoki</author><author>Matsumoto, Tatsumi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate promotes microvascular stabilization and barrier integrity of dermal microvascular endothelial cells via activation of the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 pathway</title><secondary-title>Journal of Dermatological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Dermatological Science</full-title></periodical><pages>25-32</pages><volume>103</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Microvascular permeability</keyword><keyword>Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate</keyword><keyword>PDGF-BB</keyword><keyword>Tie2</keyword><keyword>angiopoietin-1</keyword><keyword>claudin-5</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology</publisher><accession-num>34148739</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jdermsci.2021.05.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2021.05.008</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background: Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is a heparinoid and MPS-containing formulations are widely used as moisturizers for dry skin and to treat peripheral vascular insufficiency. Although MPS has therapeutic effects in skin diseases with microvascular abnormalities, the effects of MPS on microvascular function remain incompletely understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional activities of MPS on human pericytes (HPC) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) in vitro, and on microvascular permeability of the skin. Methods: The protein expression of angiopoietin (Ang)-1 in HPC, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and phosphorylated tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 2 (Tie2) in HDMEC were measured in the presence or absence of MPS. The vascular barrier was evaluated by the expressions of claudin-5 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Results: In HPC, MPS dose-dependently enhanced Ang-1 secretion, which activated Tie2 in HDMEC. In HDMEC, MPS significantly increased the production of PDGF-BB, which is important for the recruitment of HPC to the vascular endothelium, and significantly increased the phosphorylation of Tie2, which results in the activation of the Ang-1/Tie2 signaling. MPS significantly increased the expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 and TEER in the HDMEC. Moreover, the intradermal injection of MPS prevented vascular endothelial growth factor-induced increase in vascular permeability in mouse skin. Conclusion: We found that MPS promoted microvascular stabilization and barrier integrity in HDMEC via Ang-1/Tie2 activation. These results suggest that MPS might improve microvascular abnormalities in various diseases accompanied by disturbances in Ang-1/Tie2 signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Weili</author><author>Wu, Ye</author><author>Chen, Ning</author><author>Wang, Qixue</author><author>Wang, Yunfei</author><author>Li, Yansheng</author><author>Li, Sidi</author><author>Han, Xing</author><author>Yang, Eryan</author><author>Tong, Fei</author><author>Wu, Jialing</author><author>Yuan, Xubo</author><author>Kang, Chunsheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early administration of MPC-n(IVIg) selectively accumulates in ischemic areas to protect inflammation-induced brain damage from ischemic stroke</title><secondary-title>Theranostics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theranostics</full-title></periodical><pages>8197-8217</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>immunomodulatory</keyword><keyword>intravenous immunoglobulin</keyword><keyword>ischemic stroke</keyword><keyword>selective accumulation</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7150/thno.58947</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.thno.org/v11p8197.htm</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Ischemic stroke is an acute and severe neurological disease, which leads to disability and death. Immunomodulatory therapies exert multiple remarkable protective effects during ischemic stroke. However, patients suffering from ischemic stroke do not benefit from immunomodulatory therapies due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their off-target effects. Methods: We presented a delivery strategy to optimize immunomodulatory therapies by facilitating BBB penetration and selectively delivering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to ischemic regions using 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-nanocapsules, MPC-n(IVIg), synthesized using MPC monomers and ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) crosslinker via in situ polymerization. In vitro and in vivo experiments verify the effect and safety of MPC-n(IVIg). Results: MPC-n(IVIg) efficiently crosses the BBB and IVIg selectively accumulates in ischemic areas in a high-affinity choline transporter 1 (ChT1)-overexpression dependent manner via endothelial cells in ischemic areas. Moreover, earlier administration of MPC-n(IVIg) more efficiently deliver IVIg to ischemic areas. Furthermore, the early administration of low-dosage MPC-n(IVIg) decreases neurological deficits and mortality by suppressing stroke-induced inflammation in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a promising strategy to efficiently deliver the therapeutics to the ischemic target brain tissue and lower the effective dose of therapeutic drugs for treating ischemic strokes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ruter, Dana L.</author><author>Liu, Ziqing</author><author>Ngo, Kimlynn M.</author><author>X, Shaka</author><author>Marvin, Allison</author><author>Buglak, Danielle B.</author><author>Kidder, Elise J.</author><author>Bautch, Victoria L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SMAD6 transduces endothelial cell flow responses required for blood vessel homeostasis</title><secondary-title>Angiogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Angiogenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>387-398</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>BMP</keyword><keyword>Blood flow</keyword><keyword>Blood vessels</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Notch</keyword><keyword>PCDH12</keyword><keyword>SMAD</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer Netherlands</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><accession-num>33779885</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10456-021-09777-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-021-09777-7</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Fluid shear stress provided by blood flow instigates a transition from active blood vessel network expansion during development, to vascular homeostasis and quiescence that is important for mature blood vessel function. Here we show that SMAD6 is required for endothelial cell flow-mediated responses leading to maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Concomitant manipulation of the mechanosensor Notch1 pathway and SMAD6 expression levels revealed that SMAD6 functions downstream of ligand-induced Notch signaling and transcription regulation. Mechanistically, full-length SMAD6 protein was needed to rescue Notch loss-induced flow misalignment. Endothelial cells depleted for SMAD6 had defective barrier function accompanied by upregulation of proliferation-associated genes and down regulation of junction-associated genes. The vascular protocadherin PCDH12 was upregulated by SMAD6 and required for proper flow-mediated endothelial cell alignment, placing it downstream of SMAD6. Thus, SMAD6 is a required transducer of flow-mediated signaling inputs downstream of Notch1 and upstream of PCDH12, as vessels transition from an angiogenic phenotype to maintenance of a homeostatic phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holzner, Silvio</author><author>Bromberger, Sophie</author><author>Wenzina, Judith</author><author>Neumüller, Karin</author><author>Holper, Tina-Maria</author><author>Petzelbauer, Peter</author><author>Bauer, Wolfgang</author><author>Weber, Benedikt</author><author>Schossleitner, Klaudia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphorylated cingulin localises GEF-H1 at tight junctions to protect vascular barriers in blood endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cell Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cell Science</full-title></periodical><volume>134</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>AMPK</keyword><keyword>cingulin</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>guanine nucleotide exchange factors</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword><keyword>vascular barrier function</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/JCS.258557</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Phosphorylated cingulin localises GEF-H1 at tight junctions to protect vascular barriers in blood endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/doi/10.1242/jcs.258557/271185/Phosphorylated-cingulin-localises-GEF-H1-at-tight</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Cell-cell junctions of blood endothelial cells are critical barriers in inflammatory diseases.

The N-terminal region contains a binding motif for the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Phosphorylation of TIMAP on Ser331, Ser333 and Ser337 side chains was shown to regulate the activity of the TIMAP-PP1c complex. Several studies, however, reported an additional side chain of TIMAP. Ser69 is located near to the PP1c binding motif and NLS, therefore, we hypothesized that the phosphorylation of this side chain perhaps may regulate the interaction between TIMAP and PP1c, or may affect the nuclear transport of TIMAP. Materials and Methods: To study the significance of Ser69 phosphorylation, GST-tagged or c-myc-tagged wild type, phosphomimic S69D and phosphonull S69A recombinant TIMAP proteins were expressed in bacteria or endothelial cells, respectively. Protein-protein interactions of the wild type or mutant forms of TIMAP were studied by pull-down and Western blot. Localization of TIMAP S69 mutants in pulmonary artery endothelial cells was detected by immunofluorescent staining and expression and localization of the recombinants were investigated by subcellular fractionation and Western blot. Results: Modifications of Ser69 of TIMAP had no effect on binding of PP1c, ERM or RACK1. However, S69D TIMAP showed enhanced membrane localization and an increased number of membrane protrusions were observed in the cells overexpressing this phosphomimic mutant. Furthermore, significantly faster wound healing and migration rate of the S69D mutant overexpressing cells were detected by endothelial barrier resistance measurements (ECIS). Specific interaction was shown between TIMAP and polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a potential kinase to phosphorylate Ser69. Conclusions: Altogether, our results indicate that Ser69 phosphorylation by PLK4 may evoke an enrichment of TIMAP in the plasma membrane region and may play an important role in endothelial cell migration without affecting the PP1c binding ability of TIMAP.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Király, Nikolett</author><author>Thalwieser, Zsófia</author><author>Fonódi, Márton</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author><author>Boratkó, Anita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dephosphorylation of annexin A2 by protein phosphatase 1 regulates endothelial cell barrier</title><secondary-title>IUBMB Life</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IUBMB Life</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>73</volume><keywords><keyword>annexin a2</keyword><keyword>pkc</keyword><keyword>protein dephosphorylation</keyword><keyword>protein phosphatase 1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/iub.2538</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2538</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration</label><abstract>Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a multifunctional protein expressed in nearly all human tissues and cell types, playing a role in various signaling pathways. It is subjected to phosphorylation, but no specific protein phosphatase has been identified in its posttranslational regulation yet. Using pull-down assay followed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis we found that ANXA2 interacts with TIMAP (TGF-beta-inhibited membrane-associated protein) in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. TIMAP is highly expressed in endothelial cells, where it acts as a regulatory and targeting subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). TIMAP plays an important role in the regulation of the endothelial barrier maintenance through the dephosphorylation of its several substrate proteins. In the present work, phosphorylation of Ser25 side chain in ANXA2 by protein kinase C (PKC) was shown both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation level of ANXA2 at Ser25 increased greatly by inhibition of PP1 and by depletion of its regulatory subunit, TIMAP, implying a role of this PP1 holoenzyme in the dephosphorylation of ANXA2. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionations revealed a diffuse subcellular localization for the endogenous ANXA2, but phospho-Ser25 ANXA2 was mainly detected in the membrane. ANXA2 depletion lowered the basal endothelial barrier and inhibited cell migration, but had no significant effect on cell proliferation or viability. ANXA2 depleted cells failed to respond to PMA treatment, indicating an intimately involvement of phospho-ANXA2 in PKC signaling. Moreover, phosphorylation of ANXA2 disrupted its interaction with S100A10 suggesting a phosphorylation dependent multiple regulatory role of ANXA2 in endothelial cells. Our results demonstrate the pivotal role of PKC-ANXA2-PP1 pathway in endothelial cell signaling, especially in barrier function and cell migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Figueroa-Lozano, Susana</author><author>Akkerman, Renate</author><author>Beukema, Martin</author><author>van Leeuwen, Sander S.</author><author>Dijkhuizen, Lubbert</author><author>de Vos, Paul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2′-Fucosyllactose impacts the expression of mucus-related genes in goblet cells and maintains barrier function of gut epithelial cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Functional Foods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Functional Foods</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>85</volume><keywords><keyword>2′-fucosyllactose</keyword><keyword>Barrier function</keyword><keyword>Goblet cells</keyword><keyword>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)</keyword><keyword>TEER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jff.2021.104630</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104630</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Scope: Cost-effective microbial biosynthesis of 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL) allows its application in infant formula.

Dysfunction of this formation due to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) progresses the establishment of neurological disorders including stroke and traumatic brain injury. Heat shock protein 90 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory agents, and their activities are mediated, at least in part, by P53. This is a tumor suppressor protein which regulates the opposing activities of Rac1 and RhoA in the cellular cytoskeleton. In the present study we investigated the role of Hsp90 inhibitors in the H2O2-induced brain endothelium breakdown, by employing human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Our findings suggest that H2O2 downregulates P53 by enhancing the P53 suppressor mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), as well as by increasing the apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor 1 (APE1/Ref1). The H2O2 - triggered violation of the brain endothelium barrier was reflected in measurements of transendothelial resistance, and the increased expression of the key cytoskeletal modulators cofilin and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). Treatment of the hCMEC/D3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitors counteracted those events, and reduced the generation of the hydrogen peroxide - induced reactive oxygen species. Hence, our study suggests that Hsp90 inhibition supports the BBB integrity, and may represent a promising therapeutic approach for disorders associated with brain endothelium breakdown; including COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Qing</author><author>de Vries, Maaike</author><author>Nwozor, Kingsley Okechukwu</author><author>Noordhoek, Jacobien A.</author><author>Brandsma, Corry Anke</author><author>Boezen, H.

FAM13A is one of the genes often found to be associated with COPD, however its function in the pathophysiology of COPD is incompletely understood. We studied its role in airway epithelial barrier integrity and cigarette smoke-induced epithelial responses. Materials and Methods: Protein level and localization of FAM13A was assessed with immunohistochemistry in lung tissue from COPD patients and non-COPD controls. In vitro, FAM13A expression was determined in the absence or presence of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) from COPD patients and controls by western blotting. FAM13A was overexpressed in cell line 16HBE14o- and its effect on barrier function was monitored real-time by electrical resistance. Expression of junctional protein E-cadherin and β-catenin was assessed by western blotting. The secretion of neutrophil attractant CXCL8 upon CSE exposure was measured by ELISA. Results: FAM13A was strongly expressed in airway epithelium, but significantly weaker in airways of COPD patients compared to non-COPD controls. In COPD-derived AECs, but not those of controls, FAM13A was significantly downregulated by CSE. 16HBE14o- cells overexpressing FAM13A built up epithelial resistance significantly more rapidly, which was accompanied by higher E-cadherin expression and reduced CSE-induced CXCL8 levels. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the expression of FAM13A is lower in airway epithelium of COPD patients compared to non-COPD controls. In addition, cigarette smoking selectively downregulates airway epithelial expression of FAM13A in COPD patients. This may have important consequences for the pathophysiology of COPD, as the more rapid build-up of epithelial resistance upon FAM13A overexpression suggests improved (re)constitution of barrier function. The reduced epithelial secretion of CXCL8 upon CSE-induced damage suggests that lower FAM13A expression upon cigarette smoking may facilitate epithelial-driven neutrophilia.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herrera, Matthew</author><author>Molina, Patricia</author><author>Souza-Smith, Flavia M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethanol-induced lymphatic endothelial cell permeability via MAP-kinase regulation</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>C104-C116</pages><volume>321</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Alcohol</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic</keyword><keyword>MAPK</keyword><keyword>Tight junction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33909502</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpcell.00039.2021</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00039.2021</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Chronic alcohol alters the immune system enhancing the susceptibility to inflammation, bacterial, and viral infections in alcohol users. We have shown that alcohol causes increased permeability of mesenteric lymphatic vessels in alcohol-fed rats. The mechanisms of alcohol-induced lymphatic leakage are unknown. Endothelial cell monolayer permeability is controlled by junctional proteins complexes called tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ), and each can be regulated by MAPK activation. We hypothesize that ethanol induces lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) permeability via disruption of LEC TJ through MAPK activation. An in vitro model of rat LECs was used. Ethanol-supplemented medium was added at concentrations of 0, 25, and 50 mM to confluent cells. Resistance-based barrier function, transwell permeability, cell viability, TJ, AJ, and MAPK protein activity, TJ and AJ gene expressions, and the role of p38 MAPK in barrier function regulation were measured. Ethanol increased the permeability of LECs compared to controls that was not associated with decreased cell viability. LECs treated with 50 mM ethanol showed an increase in phosphorylated levels of p38. No significant changes in TJ and AJ gene or protein expressions were observed after ethanol treatment. p38 inhibition prevented ethanol-induced increases in permeability. These findings suggest that p38 may play a role in the regulation of ethanol-induced LEC permeability, but altered permeability may not be associated with decreased TJ or AJ protein expression. Further investigation into junctional protein localization is needed to better understand the effects of ethanol on lymphatic endothelial cell-to-cell contacts and hyperpermeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernández, Daniel Martin</author><author>García, Pablo Pérez</author><author>Martín, María E.</author><author>Daza, Paula</author><author>Serrano-Viseas, Juan Alfonso</author><author>Huertas, Gloria</author><author>Yúfera, Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of electrical fields on neuroblastoma (N2A) cell differentiation: Preliminary results</title><secondary-title>BIODEVICES 2021 - 14th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices; Part of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2021</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BIODEVICES 2021 - 14th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices; Part of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2021</full-title></periodical><pages>152-159</pages><volume>1</volume><keywords><keyword>Biomedical circuits</keyword><keyword>Electrical Pulse Stimulation (EPS)</keyword><keyword>Microelectrodes</keyword><keyword>Neuroblastoma (N2A)</keyword><keyword>Stem cell differentiation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><isbn>9789897584909</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5220/0010320101520159</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2021/103201/103201.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>Differentiation</label><abstract>This work describes Electrical Stimulations (ES) assays on stem cells. The neuroblastoma (N2A) cell linage was submitted to several electrical fields to enable and enhance its differentiation toward neurons. Both Direct Current (DC) and Alternated Current (AC) time dependent electric field protocols were applied to N2A cell culture under differentiation conditions, obtaining different responses. Control and electrically excited samples' number of differentiated cells and neurite lengths were measure after differentiation. Results showed that DC fields have a strong influence on N2A differentiation since the percentage of differentiated cells and the neurites lengths were the highest. In addition, a significant alignment of neurites measured with the applied electrical field has been detected, which demonstrates the high sensitivity of differentiation processes to electrical field polarity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xianyao</author><author>Yang, Yichen</author><author>Wang, Nianxue</author><author>Wu, Xijun</author><author>Xu, Jianwei</author><author>Zhou, Yanhua</author><author>Zhao, Xing</author><author>He, Zhixu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mesenchymal stem cell carriers enhance antitumor efficacy induced by oncolytic reovirus in acute myeloid leukemia</title><secondary-title>International Immunopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Immunopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>December 2020</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute myeloid leukemia</keyword><keyword>Antitumor efficacy</keyword><keyword>CXCL10</keyword><keyword>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells</keyword><keyword>Oncolytic reovirus</keyword><keyword>Virotherapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>33571747</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107437</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107437</url></web-urls></urls><label>Virology</label><abstract>Chemotherapy is the main treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the therapeutic efficacy is modest, and most commonly manifests as relapse from remission. Thus, improving long-term AML survival is a crucial clinical challenge. In recent years, oncolytic virotherapy has provided an alternative approach for AML treatment. The use of oncolytic reoviruses has been explored in more than 30 clinical trials for safety and feasibility issues. However, like other oncolytic viruses, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) reduce therapeutic efficacy. To tackle this problem, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) were used to deliver reovirus using in vitro and in vivo models. Human UC-MSCs were successfully loaded with reovirus, without impairing biological function. We also observed in vitro protective effects of hUC-MSCs on reovirus in the presence of NAbs. In the immunocompromised AML mouse model, hUC-MSCs effectively carried reoviruses to tumor lesions and significantly prolonged the survival of AML xenografts in mice in the presence of a high titer anti-reovirus antibody (p = 0.001). However, reovirus-induced activation of AKT, stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and NF-κB signaling led to the maintenance of intrinsic migratory properties and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from hUC-MSCs, particularly CXCL10. In immuno-competent AML mice, MSCs carrying reovirus triggered immune responses, and eventually inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, these results suggest that MSCs as carriers of oncolytic reoviruses can enhance the antitumor efficacy of virotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tomasek, Toria</author><author>Ware, Lorraine B.</author><author>Bastarache, Julie A.</author><author>Meegan, Jamie E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-free hemoglobin-mediated human lung microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction is not mediated by cell death</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>199-206</pages><volume>556</volume><keywords><keyword>Barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>Cell death</keyword><keyword>Endothelial</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><accession-num>33848934</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.161</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.161</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Barrier Function</label><abstract>Circulating cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) contributes to endothelial injury in several inflammatory and hemolytic conditions. We and others have shown that CFH causes increased endothelial permeability, but the precise mechanisms of CFH-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction are not fully understood. Based on our previous study in a mouse model of sepsis demonstrating that CFH increased apoptosis in the lung, we hypothesized that CFH causes endothelial barrier dysfunction through this cell death mechanism. We first confirmed that CFH causes human lung microvascular barrier dysfunction in vitro that can be prevented by the hemoglobin scavenger, haptoglobin. While CFH caused a small but significant decrease in cell viability measured by the membrane impermeable DNA dye Draq7 in human lung microvascular endothelial cells, CFH did not increase apoptosis as measured by TUNEL staining or Western blot for cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, inhibitors of apoptosis (Z-VAD-FMK), necrosis (IM-54), necroptosis (necrostatin-1), ferroptosis (ferrostatin-1), or autophagy (3-methyladenine) did not prevent CFH-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction. We conclude that although CFH may cause a modest decrease in cell viability over time, cell death does not contribute to CFH-mediated lung microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kubra, Khadeja-Tul</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brefeldin A and kifunensine modulate LPS-induced lung endothelial hyperpermeability in human and bovine cells</title><secondary-title>Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology</full-title></periodical><pages>C214-C220</pages><volume>321</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Edema</keyword><keyword>Endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>Hypertension</keyword><keyword>Junctional proteins</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>TNF-Alpha</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>34153378</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mce.2021.111368</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.111368</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Uterine artery endothelium undergoes a form of functional adaptation during pregnancy because of an increase in Cx43 communication, resulting in increased Ca2+/IP3 exchange and more synchronous and sustained vasodilator production. We have shown previously that acute exposure to growth factors and TNF can block this adaptation through ERK and/or Src-mediated Cx43 phosphorylation. In preeclampsia such adapted function is already missing, but while elevated TNF is associated with this condition, particularly after 28 weeks (late PE), elevated circulating VEGF165 is not. Given PE is a long term condition emerging in the second half of pregnancy, and is often associated with added edema, we now compare the chronic effects of these two factors on the cell monolayer in order to establish if the breakdown of junctional adherens and tight junctional assemblies in which Cx43 resides could also explain loss of vasodilatory function. We report that while TNF can degrade monolayer integrity even in the 0.1–1 ng/ml physiologic range, VEGF up to 10 ng/ml does not. In addition, the progressive action of TNF is mediated through Src and ERK signaling to promote internalization and destruction of VE-Cadherin (VE-Cad) and ZO-1, as well as the expression and secretion of a variety of proteases. At least one protein degraded from the extracellular space is VE-Cad, resulting in release of a shed VE-Cad protein product, and consistent with monolayer breakdown being sensitive to both Src and MEK/ERK kinase inhibitors and the general protease inhibitor GM6001. We conclude that the greater association of TNF with ‘late’ PE is as much due to its longer term destabilizing effects on junctional assemblies as it is to acute closure of Cx43 channels themselves. New therapies aimed at stabilizing these junctional assemblies may help treat this hypertensive condition.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klar, Stefanie</author><author>Poether, Dierk-christoph</author><author>Reinert, Jessica</author><author>Hüttig, Nicole</author><author>Linsel, Gunter</author><author>Jäckel, Udo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of impedance measurement to investigate in vitro inhalation toxicity of bacteria</title><secondary-title>Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>32</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>In vitro</keyword><keyword>Lung epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>NuLi-1</keyword><keyword>Occupational health</keyword><keyword>bacteria</keyword><keyword>cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>in vitro</keyword><keyword>lung epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>nuli-1</keyword><keyword>occupational health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology</publisher><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12995-021-00317-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Application of impedance measurement to investigate in vitro inhalation toxicity of bacteria.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12995-021-00317-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Background Workers of agriculture and intensive life stock farming are exposed to highly contaminated workplaces. Bioaerosol exposures are suspected to trigger respiratory health effects of the workers. So far, risk evaluation of bioaerosols has been assessed through the infectivity of comprising biological agents that is classified in Europe by four risk groups according to the criteria of Directive 2000/54EC of the European Parliament. However, this directive additionally requires the risk assessment of allergenic and toxigenic effects without further elaboration. The aim of our study was to establish an in vitro screening system that is able to measure inhalative toxic effects of bacteria and their metabolites. Methods In this study, we analyzed three bacterial toxins and five culture supernatants of selected bacteria with known toxicity as model agents exposed to the lung epithelial cell line NuLi-1. We used electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) method to monitor real-time cell changes and the viability test Prestoblue™. Results We confirmed concentration dependent cytotoxic effects of the selected toxins in NuLi-1 cells over a period of up to 48 h. Each toxin resulted in a different but specific impedance profile over time according to their mode of action, whereas viability assay showed the metabolic activity of the cells at a chosen time point without revealing any information on their mode of action. Furthermore, dose-response-relationships were monitored. Tested model bacteria (Streptoccous pneumoniae, Acinetobacter radioresistens, Aerococcus viridans, Aeromonas hydrophila) reacted according to their expected toxicity except one bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis). The established assays revealed the concentration dependent onset and intensity of bacterial cytotoxicity and the viability of the cells at 24 h and 48 h exposure. Conclusion Impedance measurement and the viability assay Prestoblue™ in combination are suitable as sensitive screening methods to analyze toxic potential of bacteria and can therefor support the risk assessment of workplaces in terms of the directive 2000/54/EC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khan, Alamzeb</author><author>Ni, Weiming</author><author>Lopez-Giraldez, Francesc</author><author>Kluger, Martin S.</author><author>Pober, Jordan S.</author><author>Pierce, Richard W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tumor necrosis factor-induced ArhGEF10 selectively activates RhoB contributing to human microvascular endothelial cell tight junction disruption</title><secondary-title>FASEB Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor</keyword><keyword>capillary leak</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>transendothelial electrical resistance</keyword><keyword>vascular dysfunction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33948992</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.202002783RR</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002783RR</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Capillary endothelial cells (ECs) maintain a semi-permeable barrier between the blood and tissue by forming inter-EC tight junctions (TJs), regulating selective transport of fluid and solutes. Overwhelming inflammation, as occurs in sepsis, disrupts these TJs, leading to leakage of fluid, proteins, and small molecules into the tissues. Mechanistically, disruption of capillary barrier function is mediated by small Rho-GTPases, such as RhoA, -B, and -C, which are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and disrupted by GTPase-activating factors (GAPs). We previously reported that a mutation in a specific RhoB GAP (p190BRhoGAP) underlays a hereditary capillary leak syndrome. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment disrupts TJs in cultured human microvascular ECs, a model of capillary leak. This response requires new gene transcription and involves increased RhoB activation. However, the specific GEF that activates RhoB in capillary ECs remains unknown. Transcriptional profiling of cultured tight junction-forming human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) revealed that 17 GEFs were significantly induced by TNF. The function of each candidate GEF was assessed by short interfering RNA depletion and trans-endothelial electrical resistance screening. Knockown of ArhGEF10 reduced the TNF-induced loss of barrier which was phenocopied by RhoB or dual ArhGEF10/RhoB knockdown. ArhGEF10 knockdown also reduced the extent of TNF-induced RhoB activation and disruption at tight junctions. In a cell-free assay, immunoisolated ArhGEF10 selectively catalyzed nucleotide exchange to activate RhoB, but not RhoA or RhoC. We conclude ArhGEF10 is a TNF-induced RhoB-selective GEF that mediates TJ disruption and barrier loss in human capillary endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karki, Pratap</author><author>Cha, Boyoung</author><author>Zhang, Chen Ou</author><author>Li, Yue</author><author>Ke, Yunbo</author><author>Promnares, Kamoltip</author><author>Kaibuchi, Kozo</author><author>Yoshimura, Akihiko</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G.</author><author>Birukova, Anna A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microtubule-dependent mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of SOCS1 in endothelial dysfunction and lung injury</title><secondary-title>FASEB Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>lung injury</keyword><keyword>microtubules</keyword><keyword>vascular endothelium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33724556</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.202001477RR</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001477RR</url></web-urls></urls><label>Permeability;TEER</label><abstract>Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) provide negative regulation of inflammatory reaction. The role and precise cellular mechanisms of SOCS1 in control of endothelial dysfunction and barrier compromise associated with acute lung injury remain unexplored. Our results show that siRNA-mediated SOCS1 knockdown augmented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and enhanced inflammatory response. Consistent with in vitro data, EC-specific SOCS1 knockout mice developed more severe lung vascular leak and accumulation of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SOCS1 overexpression exhibited protective effects against LPS-induced endothelial permeability and inflammation, which were dependent on microtubule (MT) integrity. Biochemical and image analysis of unstimulated EC showed SOCS1 association with the MT, while challenge with LPS or MT depolymerizing agent colchicine impaired this association. SOCS1 directly interacted with N2 domains of MT-associated proteins CLIP-170 and CLASP2. Furthermore, N-terminal region of SOCS1 was indispensable for these interactions and SOCS1-ΔN mutant lacking N-terminal 59 amino acids failed to rescue LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction. Depletion of endogenous CLIP-170 or CLASP2 abolished SOCS1 interaction with Toll-like receptor-4 and Janus kinase-2 leading to impairment of SOCS1 inhibitory effects on LPS-induced inflammation. Altogether, these findings suggest that endothelial barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects of SOCS1 are critically dependent on its targeting to the MT.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ng'ang'a, Peter Njenga</author><author>Siukstaite, Lina</author><author>Lang, Alexander E.</author><author>Bakker, Hans</author><author>Römer, Winfried</author><author>Aktories, Klaus</author><author>Schmidt, Gudula</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Involvement of N-glycans in binding of Photorhabdus luminescens Tc toxin</title><secondary-title>Cellular Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>bacterial toxin</keyword><keyword>glycan</keyword><keyword>receptor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33720490</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cmi.13326</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.13326</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity;TEER</label><abstract>Photorhabdus luminescens Tc toxins are large tripartite ABC-type toxin complexes, composed of TcA, TcB and TcC proteins. Tc toxins are widespread and have shown a tropism for a variety of targets including insect, mammalian and human cells. However, their receptors and the specific mechanisms of uptake into target cells remain unknown. Here, we show that the TcA protein TcdA1 interacts with N-glycans, particularly Lewis X/Y antigens. This is confirmed using N-acetylglucosamine transferase I (Mgat1 gene product)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Lec1 cells, which are highly resistant to intoxication by the Tc toxin complex most likely due to the absence of complex N-glycans. Restoring Mgat1 gene activity, and hence complex N-glycan biosynthesis, recapitulated the sensitivity of these cells to the toxin. Exogenous addition of Lewis X trisaccharide partially inhibits intoxication in wild-type cells. Additionally, sialic acid also largely reduced binding of the Tc toxin. Moreover, proteolytic activation of TcdA1 alters glycan-binding and uptake into target cells. The data suggest that TcdA1-binding is most likely multivalent, and carbohydrates probably work cooperatively to facilitate binding and intoxication.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouwels, Simon D.</author><author>Wiersma, Valerie R.</author><author>Fokkema, Immeke E.</author><author>Berg, Marijn</author><author>ten Hacken, Nick H.T.</author><author>van den Berge, Maarten</author><author>Heijink, Irene</author><author>Faiz, Alen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute cigarette smoke-induced eQTL affects formyl peptide receptor expression and lung function</title><secondary-title>Respirology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Respirology</full-title></periodical><pages>233-240</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</keyword><keyword>cigarette smoking</keyword><keyword>formyl peptide receptor</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>quantitative trait loci</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33078507</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/resp.13960</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13960</url></web-urls></urls><label>Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background and objective: Cigarette smoking is one of the most prevalent causes of preventable deaths worldwide, leading to chronic diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoke is known to induce significant transcriptional modifications throughout the respiratory tract. However, it is largely unknown how genetic profiles influence the smoking-related transcriptional changes and how changes in gene expression translate into altered alveolar epithelial repair responses. Methods: We performed a candidate-based acute cigarette smoke-induced eQTL study, investigating the association between SNP and differential gene expression of FPR family members in bronchial epithelial cells isolated 24 h after smoking and after 48 h without smoking. The effects FPR1 on lung epithelial integrity and repair upon damage in the presence and absence of cigarette smoke were studied in CRISPR-Cas9-generated lung epithelial knockout cells. Results: One significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) inducible eQTL (rs3212855) was identified that induced a &gt;2-fold change in gene expression. The minor allele of rs3212855 was associated with significantly higher gene expression of FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3 upon smoking. Importantly, the minor allele of rs3212855 was also associated with lower lung function. Alveolar epithelial FPR1 knockout cells were protected against CSE-induced reduction in repair capacity upon wounding. Conclusion: We identified a novel smoking-related inducible eQTL that is associated with a smoke-induced increase in the expression of FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3, and with lowered lung function. in vitro FPR1 down-regulation protects against smoke-induced reduction in lung epithelial repair.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pham, Tan Phát</author><author>van Bergen, Anke S.</author><author>Kremer, Veerle</author><author>Glaser, Simone F.</author><author>Dimmeler, Stefanie</author><author>Boon, Reinier A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LncRNA AERRIE Is Required for Sulfatase 1 Expression, but Not for Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>endmt</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>non-coding rna</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22158088</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158088</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>Endothelial cells can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype through a process called Endothelial‐to‐Mesenchymal transition (EndMT). This event is found in embryonic development, but also in pathological conditions. Blood vessels lose their ability to maintain vascular homeostasis and ultimately develop atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, or fibrosis. An increase in inflammatory signals causes an upregulation of EndMT transcription factors, mesenchymal markers, and a decrease in endothelial markers. In our study, we show that the induction of EndMT results in an increase in long non‐coding RNA AERRIE expression. JMJD2B, a known EndMT regulator, induces AERRIE and subsequently SULF1. Silencing of AERRIE shows a partial regulation of SULF1 but showed no effect on the endothelial and mesenchymal markers. Additionally, the overexpression of AERRIE results in no significant changes in EndMT markers, suggesting that AERRIE is marginally regulating mesenchymal markers and transcription factors. This study identifies AERRIE as a novel factor in EndMT, but its mechanism of action still needs to be elucidated.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xin, Ling</author><author>Liu, Chang</author><author>Liu, Yinhua</author><author>Mansel, Robert E.</author><author>Davies, Eleri</author><author>Jiang, Wen G.</author><author>Martin, Tracey A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SIKs suppress tumor function and regulate drug resistance in breast cancer</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3537-3557</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>drug resistance</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>salt-inducible kinase</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1538-7445.sabcs20-ps4-41</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8332863/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Salt-inducible kinases (SIKs), belonging to an AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) family, have an evolving role in tumourigenesis and metastasis in many solid tumours.

In clinical cohort of breast cancer, the expression of SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3 increased expression of SIKs was associated with good clinical outcome in breast cancer cohort. In vitro, reduced expression of SIK2 and SIK3, by way of knockdown increased the proliferation of breast cancer cells. However, SIK2 and SIK3 had contrasting effects on adhesion in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of SIK2 only enhanced the adhesion of triple negative breast cancer cell, while knockdown of SIK3 can decrease the adhesion of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of SIK1 and SIK3 was seen to increase the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, reduced SIKs, even triple knockdown of SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3 rendered the breast cancer cells to confer chemoresistance to paclitaxel and cisplatin.

In this study, we aimed to dissect the role of different mitochondrial components; specifically, those of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), in maintaining the barrier functionality of RPE. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology was used to collect multi-frequency electrical impedance data to assess in real-time the barrier formation of the RPE cells. For this purpose, the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line—ARPE-19—was used and treated with varying concentrations of specific mitochondrial inhibitors that target different steps in OxPhos: Rotenone for complex I (the largest protein complex in the electron transport chain (ETC)); oligomycin for ATP synthase; and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) for uncoupling ATP synthesis from the accompanying ETC. Furthermore, data were modeled using the ECIS-Zθ software to investigate in depth the effects of these inhibitors on three separate barrier parameters: cell–cell interactions (Rb), cell–matrix interactions (α), and the cell membrane capacitance (Cm). The viability of ARPE-19 cells was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay. The ECIS program’s modeling demonstrated that FCCP and thus OxPhos uncoupling disrupt the barrier function in the ARPE-19 cells across all three components of the total resistance (Rb, α, and Cm) in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, oligomycin and thus ATP synthase inhibition mostly affects the ARPE-19 cells' attachment to their substrate evident by a significant decrease in α resistance in a dose-dependent manner, both at the end and throughout the duration of the experiment. On the contrary, rotenone and complex I inhibition mostly affect the ARPE-19 paracellular resistance Rb in a dose-dependent manner compared to basolateral resistance α or Cm. Our results clearly demonstrate differential roles for different mitochondrial components in maintaining RPE cell functionality in which uncoupling of OxPhos is a major contributing factor to the disruption barrier function. Such differences can be used in investigating gene expression as well as for screening of selective agents that improve the OxPhos coupling efficiency to be used in the therapeutic approach for treating RPE-related retinal diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giblin, Meredith</author><author>Smith, Taylor E.</author><author>Winkler, Garrett</author><author>Pendergrass, Hannah A.</author><author>Kim, Minjae J.</author><author>Capozzi, Megan E.</author><author>Yang, Rong</author><author>McCollum, Gary W.</author><author>Penn, John S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) regulation of IL-1β-induced retinal vascular inflammation</title><secondary-title>BBA Molecular Basis of Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BBA Molecular Basis of Disease</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy</keyword><keyword>Muller cell</keyword><keyword>inflammation' endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166238</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166238</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Chronic low-grade retinal inflammation is an essential contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). It is characterized by increased retinal cell expression and secretion of a variety of inflammatory cytokines; among these, IL-1β has the reputation of being a major driver of cytokine-induced inflammation. IL-1β and other cytokines drive inflammatory changes that cause damage to retinal cells, leading to the hallmark vascular lesions of DR; these include increased leukocyte adherence, vascular permeability, and capillary cell death. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a transcriptional regulator of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules and is expressed in retinal cells. Consequently, it may influence multiple pathogenic steps early in DR. We investigated the NFAT-dependency of IL-1β-induced inflammation in human Müller cells (hMC) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMEC). Our results show that an NFAT inhibitor, Inhibitor of NFAT-Calcineurin Association-6 (INCA-6), decreased IL-1β-induced expression of IL-1β and TNFα in hMC, while having no effect on VEGF, CCL2, or CCL5 expression. We also demonstrate that INCA-6 attenuated IL-1β-induced increases of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, CCL2, and CCL5 (inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), and ICAM-1 and E-selectin (leukocyte adhesion molecules) expression in hRMEC. INCA-6 similarly inhibited IL-1β-induced increases in leukocyte adhesion in both hRMEC monolayers in vitro and an acute model of retinal inflammation in vivo. Finally, INCA-6 rescued IL-1β-induced permeability in both hRMEC monolayers in vitro and an acute model of retinal inflammation in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate the potential of NFAT inhibition to mitigate retinal inflammation secondary to diabetes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Huilei</author><author>Chen, James</author><author>Jandu, Sandeep</author><author>Melucci, Sean</author><author>Savage, William</author><author>Nandakumar, Kavitha</author><author>Kang, Sara K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Probing tissue transglutaminase mediated vascular smooth muscle cell aging using a novel transamidation-de fi cient Tgm2 -C277S mouse model</title><secondary-title>Cell Death Discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Death Discovery</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>197</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41420-021-00543-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Probing tissue transglutaminase mediated vascular smooth muscle cell aging using a novel transamidation-deficient Tgm2-C277S mouse model.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41420-021-00543-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Growth;Proliferation</label><abstract>Tissue transglutaminase (TG2), a multifunctional protein of the transglutaminase family, has putative transamidation-independent functions in aging-associated vascular stiffening and dysfunction. Developing preclinical models will be critical to fully understand the physiologic relevance of TG2’s transamidation-independent activity and to identify the specific function of TG2 for therapeutic targeting. Therefore, in this study, we harnessed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to introduce a mutation at cysteine 277 in the active site of the mouse Tgm2 gene. Heterozygous and homozygous Tgm2-C277S mice were phenotypically normal and were born at the expected Mendelian frequency. TG2 protein was ubiquitously expressed in the Tgm2-C277S mice at levels similar to those of wild-type (WT) mice. In the Tgm2-C277S mice, TG2 transglutaminase function was successfully obliterated, but the transamidation-independent functions ascribed to GTP, fibronectin, and integrin binding were preserved. In vitro, a remodeling stimulus led to the significant loss of vascular compliance in WT mice, but not in the Tgm2-C277S or TG2−/− mice. Vascular stiffness increased with age in WT mice, as measured by pulse-wave velocity and tensile testing. Tgm2-C277S mice were protected from age-associated vascular stiffening, and TG2 knockout yielded further protection. Together, these studies show that TG2 contributes significantly to overall vascular modulus and vasoreactivity independent of its transamidation function, but that transamidation activity is a significant cause of vascular matrix stiffening during aging. Finally, the Tgm2-C277S mice can be used for in vivo studies to explore the transamidation-independent roles of TG2 in physiology and pathophysiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Htwe, Yu Maw</author><author>Wang, Huashan</author><author>Belvitch, Patrick</author><author>Meliton, Lucille</author><author>Bandela, Mounica</author><author>Letsiou, Eleftheria</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Group V Phospholipase A2 Mediates Endothelial Dysfunction and Acute Lung Injury Caused by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>1731</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>ali</keyword><keyword>ards</keyword><keyword>bacterial</keyword><keyword>claims in</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>gvpla 2</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>intravital microscopy</keyword><keyword>mdpi stays neutral</keyword><keyword>mrsa</keyword><keyword>pla 2 g5</keyword><keyword>publisher</keyword><keyword>s note</keyword><keyword>secretory phospholipase a 2</keyword><keyword>spla 2 -v</keyword><keyword>usa300</keyword><keyword>with regard to jurisdictional</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><isbn>1312996803</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells10071731</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Group V Phospholipase A2 Mediates Endothelial Dysfunction and Acute Lung Injury Caused by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells10071731</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Lung endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of acute lung injury (ALI) and clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous studies have identified the lipid-generating enzyme, group V phospholipase A2 (gVPLA2), as a mediator of lung endothelial barrier disruption and inflammation. The current study aimed to determine the role of gVPLA2 in mediating lung endothelial responses to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300 strain), a major cause of ALI/ARDS. In vitro studies assessed the effects of gVPLA2 inhibition on lung endothelial cell (EC) permeability after exposure to heat-killed (HK) MRSA. In vivo studies assessed the effects of intratracheal live or HK-MRSA on multiple indices of ALI in wild-type (WT) and gVPLA2-deficient (KO) mice. In vitro, HK-MRSA increased gVPLA2 expression and permeability in human lung EC. Inhibition of gVPLA2 with either the PLA2 inhibitor, LY311727, or with a specific monoclonal antibody, attenuated the barrier disruption caused by HK-MRSA. LY311727 also reduced HK-MRSA-induced permeability in mouse lung EC isolated from WT but not gVPLA2-KO mice. In vivo, live MRSA caused significantly less ALI in gVPLA2 KO mice compared to WT, findings confirmed by intravital microscopy assessment in HK-MRSA-treated mice. After targeted delivery of gVPLA2 plasmid to lung endothelium using ACE antibody-conjugated liposomes, MRSA-induced ALI was significantly increased in gVPLA2-KO mice, indicating that lung endothelial expression of gVPLA2 is critical in vivo. In summary, these results demonstrate an important role for gVPLA2 in mediating MRSA-induced lung EC permeability and ALI. Thus, gVPLA2 may represent a novel therapeutic target in ALI/ARDS caused by bacterial infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hao, Chengcheng</author><author>Cui, Yuxin</author><author>Lane, Jane</author><author>Jia, Shuqin</author><author>Ji, Jiafu</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distinctive Prognostic Value and Cellular Functions of Osteopontin Splice Variants in Human Gastric Cancer</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells10071820</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Distinctive Prognostic Value and Cellular Functions of Osteopontin Splice Variants in Human Gastric Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/7/1820/htm#</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background: Osteopontin (OPN) splice variants are identified as predictors of tumour progression and therapeutic resistance in certain types of solid tumours. However, their roles in gastric cancer (GC) remain poorly characterized. The current study sought to assess the prognostic value of the three OPN splice variants (namely OPN-a, OPN-b, and OPN-c) in gastric cancer and their potential functions within gastric cancer cells. Methods: RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed using our clinical cohort of gastric carcinomas and matched normal tissues (n = 324 matched pairs). Transcript levels were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. Three OPN splice variants overexpressed cell lines were created from the gastric cancer cell line HGC-27. Subsequently, biological functions, including cell growth, adhesion, migration, and invasion, were studied. The potential effects of OPN isoforms on cisplatin and 5-Fu were evaluated by detecting cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the HGC-27-derived cell lines. Results: Compared with normal tissues, the expression levels of three splice variants were all elevated in gastric cancer tissues in an order of OPN-a &gt; OPN-b &gt; OPN-c. The OPN-a level significantly increased with increasing TNM staging and worse clinical outcome. There appeared to be a downregulation for OPN-c in increasing lymph node status (p &lt; 0.05), increasing TNM staging, and poor differentiation. High levels of OPN-a and OPN-b were correlated with short overall survival and disease-free survival of gastric cancer patients. However, the low expression of OPN-c was significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Functional analyses further showed that ectopic expression of OPN-c suppressed in vitro proliferation, adhesiveness, migration, and invasion properties of HGC-27 cells, while the opposite role was seen for OPN-a. Cellular ROS detection indicated that OPN-a and OPN-c significantly promoted ROS production after treatment with 5-Fu comparing to OPN-vector, while only OPN-a markedly induced ROS production after treatment with cisplatin. Conclusion: Our results suggest that OPN splice variants have distinguished potential to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer. Three OPN variants exert distinctive functions in gastric cancer cells. Focusing on specific OPN isoforms could be a novel direction for developing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in gastric cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merrick, Michael</author><author>Mimlitz, Michael</author><author>Weeder, Catherine</author><author>Akhter, Haris</author><author>Bray, Allie</author><author>Walther, Andrew</author><author>Nwakama, Chisom</author><author>Bamesberger, Joe</author><author>Djam, Honour</author><author>Abid, Kaamil</author><author>Ekpenyong, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro radiotherapy and chemotherapy alter migration of brain cancer cells before cell death</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>101071</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>Sep 2021</issue><keywords><keyword>Brain cancer</keyword><keyword>Brain metastasis</keyword><keyword>Chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>Glioblastoma</keyword><keyword>Migration</keyword><keyword>Neuronal cells</keyword><keyword>Radioresistance</keyword><keyword>Radiosensitivity</keyword><keyword>Radiotherapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.07.23.218636</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In vitro radiotherapy and chemotherapy alter migration of brain cancer cells before cell death.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.101071</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Migration</label><abstract>Although radiotherapy and most cancer drugs target the proliferation of cancer cells, it is metastasis, the complex process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor to other tissues and organs of the body where they form new tumors, that leads to over 90% of all cancer deaths. Thus, there is an urgent need for anti-metastasis strategies alongside chemotherapy and radiotherapy. An important step in the metastatic cascade is migration. It is the first step in metastasis via local invasion. Here we address the question whether ionizing radiation and/or chemotherapy might inadvertently promote metastasis and/or invasiveness by enhancing cell migration. We used a standard laboratory irradiator, Faxitron CellRad, to irradiate both non-cancer (HCN2 neurons) and cancer cells (T98G glioblastoma) with 2 Gy, 10 Gy and 20 Gy of X-rays. Paclitaxel (5 μM) was used for chemotherapy. We then measured the attachment and migration of the cells using an electric cell substrate impedance sensing device. Both the irradiated HCN2 cells and T98G cells showed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) enhanced migration compared to non-irradiated cells, within the first 20 to 40 hours following irradiation with 20 Gy. Our results suggest that cell migration should be a therapeutic target in anti-metastasis/anti-invasion strategies for improved radiotherapy and chemotherapy outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wan, Wencui</author><author>Zhu, Wei</author><author>Wu, Yan</author><author>Long, Yang</author><author>Liu, Hongzhuo</author><author>Wan, Weiwei</author><author>Wan, Guangming</author><author>Yu, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extract Moderated Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cellular Senescence Through NAMPT / SIRT1 / NLRP3 Pathway</title><secondary-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3129-3143</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>July</issue><keywords><keyword>cellular senescence</keyword><keyword>inflammasome</keyword><keyword>nicotinamide</keyword><keyword>nlrp3</keyword><keyword>phosphoribosyltransferase</keyword><keyword>retinal pigment epithelium</keyword><keyword>sirtuin 1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/JIR.S306456</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extract Moderated Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cellular Senescence Through NAMPT-SIRT1-NLRP3 Pathway.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.2147%2FJIR.S306456</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;TEER24</label><abstract>Background Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cellular senescence is an important process in degenerative retinal disorders. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) alleviates senescence-related degenerative disorders; however, the potential effects of GSPE intake on RPE cellular senescence through regulating NAMPT/SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway remain unclear. Methods The effects of GSPE on NAMPT expression and NAD+ contents were detected with Western blot and assay kit in both in-vivo and in-vitro AMD models. Senescence-related biomarkers, including p16, p21 expressions and β-gal staining, were conducted in different groups. The protective effects of GSPE treatment on the mitochondrial homeostasis and barrier function of RPE cells were detected using mtDNA lesions analyses, JC-1 staining, ZO1 staining and trans-epithelial cell resistance (TEER) detection. The expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in different groups would be conducted with qPCR. To demonstrate the potential effects of NAMPT/SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway after GSPE treatment, the protein levels of relevant key regulators after applications of NAMPT inhibitor, Fk866, and SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527. Results GSPE significantly improves the NAMPT expression and NAD+ content in aging mice, and thus alleviates the RPE cellular senescence. In advanced in-vitro studies, GSPE significantly up-regulated NAMPT content and thus relieved H2O2 induced NAD+ depression through analyzing the NAD+ contents in different groups. In advanced analyses, it was reported that GSPE could alleviate mitochondrial permeability, mtDNA damage, ZO1 expression and SASP levels in aging RPE cells. Thus, GSPE treatment significantly decreased senescence-related protein p16 and p21, as well as SASP levels in in-vitro aging model, and it was demonstrated that GSPE could illustrate a significant anti-aging effect. The Western blot data in GSPE treatment of aging RPE cells demonstrated that GSPE could significantly improve NAMPT and SIRT1 levels, and thus depressed NLRP3 expression. Conclusion This study indicated that GSPE alleviated RPE cellular senescence through NAMPT/SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway. This study highlighted the potential effects of GSPE on degenerative retinopathy through the crosstalk of NAD+ metabolism, SIRT1 function and NLRP3 activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Li, Liang</author><author>Huo, Dong</author><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Yang, Xiaopei</author><author>Dai, Menghong</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meningitic Escherichia coli α ‑ hemolysin aggravates blood – brain barrier disruption via targeting TGFβ1 ‑ triggered hedgehog signaling</title><secondary-title>Molecular Brain</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Brain</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>116</issue><keywords><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>hedgehog</keyword><keyword>intercellular communication</keyword><keyword>tgfβ1</keyword><keyword>α-hemolysin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13041-021-00826-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Meningitic Escherichia coli α-hemolysin aggravates blood–brain barrier disruption via targeting TGFβ1-triggered hedgehog signaling.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13041-021-00826-2</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infectious disease with severe neurological sequelae and a high mortality rate, in which Escherichia coli is one of the primary Gram-negative etiological bacteria. Meningitic E. coli infection is often accompanied by an elevated blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. BBB is the structural and functional barrier composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, and pericytes, and we have previously shown that astrocytes-derived TGFβ1 physiologically maintained the BBB permeability by triggering a non-canonical hedgehog signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Here, we subsequently demonstrated that meningitic E. coli infection could subvert this intercellular communication within BBB by attenuating TGFBRII/Gli2-mediated such signaling. By high-throughput screening, we identified E. coli α-hemolysin as the critical determinant responsible for this attenuation through Sp1-dependent TGFBRII reduction and triggering Ca2+ influx and protein kinase A activation, thus leading to Gli2 suppression. Additionally, the exogenous hedgehog agonist SAG exhibited promising protection against the infection-caused BBB dysfunction. Our work revealed a hedgehog-targeted pathogenic mechanism during meningitic E. coli-caused BBB disruption and suggested that activating hedgehog signaling within BBB could be a potential protective strategy for future therapy of bacterial meningitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Surolia, Ranu</author><author>Li, Fu Jun</author><author>Wang, Zheng</author><author>Kashyap, Mahendra</author><author>Srivastava, Ritesh Kumar</author><author>Traylor, Amie M.</author><author>Singh, Pooja</author><author>Dsouza, Kevin G.</author><author>Kim, Harrison</author><author>Pittet, Jean Francois</author><author>Zmijewski, Jaroslaw W.</author><author>Agarwal, Anupam</author><author>Athar, Mohammad</author><author>Ahmad, Aftab</author><author>Antony, Veena B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NETosis in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury following cutaneous chemical burns</title><secondary-title>JCI Insight</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JCI Insight</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34027893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/jci.insight.147564</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NETosis in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury following cutaneous chemical burns.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1172%2Fjci.insight.147564</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Despite the high morbidity and mortality among patients with extensive cutaneous burns in the intensive care unit due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, effective therapeutics remain to be determined. This is primarily because the mechanisms leading to acute lung injury (ALI) in these patients remain unknown. We test the hypothesis that cutaneous chemical burns promote lung injury due to systemic activation of neutrophils, in particular, toxicity mediated by the deployment of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We also demonstrate the potential benefit of a peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor to prevent NETosis and to preserve microvascular endothelial barrier function, thus reducing the severity of ALI in mice. Our data demonstrated that phenylarsine oxide (PAO) treatment of neutrophils caused increased intracellular Ca2+-associated PAD4 activity. A dermal chemical burn by lewisite or PAO resulted in PAD4 activation, NETosis, and ALI. NETs disrupted the barrier function of endothelial cells in human lung microvascular endothelial cell spheroids. Citrullinated histone 3 alone caused ALI in mice. Pharmacologic or genetic abrogation of PAD4 inhibited lung injury following cutaneous chemical burns. Cutaneous burns by lewisite and PAO caused ALI by PAD4-mediated NETosis. PAD4 inhibitors may have potential as countermeasures to suppress detrimental lung injury after chemical burns.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nocca, Giuseppina</author><author>Avenio, Giuseppe D</author><author>Amalfitano, Adriana</author><author>Chronopoulou, Laura</author><author>Mordente, Alvaro</author><author>Palocci, Cleofe</author><author>Grigioni, Mauro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controlled Release of 18-β-Glycyrrhetinic Acid from Core-Shell Nanoparticles: Effects on Cytotoxicity and Intracellular Concentration in HepG2 Cell Line</title><secondary-title>Materials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Materials</full-title></periodical><pages>3893</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>affil-</keyword><keyword>claims in</keyword><keyword>cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>drug delivery</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>mdpi stays neutral</keyword><keyword>nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>published maps and institutional</keyword><keyword>publisher</keyword><keyword>s note</keyword><keyword>with regard to jurisdictional</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ma14143893</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Controlled Release of 18-β-Glycyrrhetinic Acid from Core-Shell Nanoparticles Effects on Cytotoxicity and Intracellular Concentration in HepG2 Cell Line.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14143893</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Growth;Proliferation</label><abstract>18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a pentacyclic triterpene with promising hepatoprotective and anti-Hepatocellular carcinoma effects. GA low water solubility however reduces its biodistribution and bioavailability, limiting its applications in biomedicine. In this work we used core-shell NPs made of PolyD-L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) coated with chitosan (CS), prepared through an osmosis-based methodology, to efficiently entrap GA.

Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay, as well as with Electric Cells-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS), that provided a real-time continuous monitoring. It was possible to correlate the toxic effect of the different forms of GA with the bioavailability of the drug, evidencing the importance of real-time tests for studying the effects of bioactive substances on cell cultures.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ran, Xiao</author><author>Zhang, Qin</author><author>Li, Shaoping</author><author>Yu, Zhen</author><author>Wan, Li</author><author>Wu, Bin</author><author>Wu, Rongxue</author><author>Li, Shusheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue Kallikrein Exacerbating Sepsis-Induced Endothelial Hyperpermeability is Highly Predictive of Severity and Mortality in Sepsis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Inflammation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>3321-3333</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords><keyword>endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>junction protein</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>tissue kallikrein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/JIR.S317874</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tissue Kallikrein Exacerbating Sepsis-Induced Endothelial Hyperpermeability is Highly Predictive of Severity and Mortality in Sepsis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.2147/JIR.S317874</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Aim: Sepsis, an acute, life-threatening dysregulated response to infection, affects practically all aspects of endothelial function. Tissue kallikrein (TK) is a key enzyme in the kallikrein– kinin system (KKS) which has been implicated in endothelial permeability. Thus, we aimed to establish a potentially novel association among TK, endothelial permeability, and sepsis demonstrated by clinical investigation and in vitro studies. Methods: We performed a clinical investigation with the participation of a total of 76 controls, 42 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients, and 150 patients with sepsis, who were followed-up for 28 days. Circulating TK levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Then, the effect of TK on sepsis-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was evaluated by in vitro study. Results: Data showed a gradual increase in TK level among controls and the patients with SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock (0.288±0.097 mg/l vs 0.335±0.149 vs 0.495±0.170 vs 0.531 ±0.188 mg/l, respectively, P &lt;0.001). Further analysis revealed that plasma TK level was positively associated with the severity and mortality of sepsis and negatively associated with event-free survival during 28 days of follow-up (relative risk, 3.333; 95% CI, 2.255–4.925; p &lt; 0.001). With a septic model of TK and kallistatin in vitro, we found that TK exacerbated sepsis-induced endothelial hyperpermeability by downregulating zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and these could be reversed by kallistatin, an inhibitor of TK. Conclusion: TK can be used in the diagnosis of sepsis and assessment of severity and prognosis of disease. Inhibition of TK may be a novel therapeutic target for sepsis through increasing ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, as well as downregulating endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beckmann, Denise</author><author>Römer-Hillmann, Anja</author><author>Krause, Annika</author><author>Hansen, Uwe</author><author>Wehmeyer, Corinna</author><author>Intemann, Johanna</author><author>de Gorter, David J.J.</author><author>Dankbar, Berno</author><author>Hillen, Jan</author><author>Heitzmann, Marianne</author><author>Begemann, Isabell</author><author>Galic, Milos</author><author>Weinhage, Toni</author><author>Foell, Dirk</author><author>Ai, Rizi</author><author>Kremerskothen, Joachim</author><author>Kiener, Hans P.</author><author>Müller, Sylvia</author><author>Kamradt, Thomas</author><author>Schröder, Christopher</author><author>Leitão, Elsa</author><author>Horsthemke, Bernhard</author><author>Rosenstiel, Philip</author><author>Nordström, Karl</author><author>Gasparoni, Gilles</author><author>Gasparoni, Nina</author><author>Walter, Jörn</author><author>Li, Na</author><author>Yang, Xinyi</author><author>Chung, Ho Ryun</author><author>Pavenstädt, Hermann</author><author>Lindemann, Nico</author><author>Schnittler, Hans J.</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Firestein, Gary S.</author><author>Pap, Thomas</author><author>Korb-Pap, Adelheid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lasp1 regulates adherens junction dynamics and fibroblast transformation in destructive arthritis</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>34131132</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-021-23706-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lasp1 regulates adherens junction dynamics and fibroblast transformation in destructive arthritis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41467-021-23706-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (Lasp1) was originally cloned from metastatic breast cancer and characterised as an adaptor molecule associated with tumourigenesis and cancer cell invasion.

Underlying medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have been associated with increased risk for severe illness. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by surface spike protein binding to host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Isolated S protein of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to induce an innate immune response. Here we investigate the cytokine response of monocytes with and without comorbidities (obesity and hypertension) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the effects of this response on endothelial barrier function. Methods Human CD14+ monocytes (Lonza, Precision for Medicine) from two Caucasian males in their 50s, one with obesity and hypertension (HTN) and one without, were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL [positive control]), recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD, 10 ug/mL) or serum-free media (negative control) for 48 hours. Monocyte conditioned media (MCM) was collected and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4) were analyzed by multiplex ELISA. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) from a healthy donor were exposed to MCM from healthy or HTN subjects. Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Briefly, HLMVECs were seeded on ECIS chambers to proliferate until impedance plateaued. Half of the media was then replaced with MCM. Differences in impedance drops were compared among various conditions. Western blotting was used to investigate Spike RBD internalization. Results Spike RBD and resulted in increased IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, and TNF-alpha compared to negative control (Fig1A). Monocytes from HTN subject showed increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12p70 compared to those from the healthy subject (Fig 1B). HLMVECs showed moderate long-term barrier disruption, when treated with Spike RBD alone and Spike RBD with MCM from healthy subjects and no difference in transient barrier disruption or recovery. HLMVECs exposed to MCM from HTN subjects showed increased long-term barrier dysfunction, especially with Spike RBD present, and recovery of barrier function was also hampered (Fig 2). Spike RBD was observed to be internalized by both monocytes and HLMVECs. Discussion Spike RBD alone induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by CD14+ monocytes and is further increased in monocytes from the obese/HTN subject. Exposure to Spike RBD and MCM from both healthy and HTN subjects caused significant long-term endothelial barrier dysfunction in HLMVECs with increased dysfunction seen for the obese/HTN MCM. These results are consistent with clinical experience with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased disease severity, and worse outcome in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Further work is being done to characterize the cytokine profile and mechanisms of barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marottoli, Felecia M.</author><author>Trevino, Troy N.</author><author>Geng, Xue</author><author>Arbieva, Zarema</author><author>Kanabar, Pinal</author><author>Maienschein-Cline, Mark</author><author>Lee, James C.</author><author>Lutz, Sarah E.</author><author>Tai, Leon M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Autocrine Effects of Brain Endothelial Cell-Produced Human Apolipoprotein E on Metabolism and Inflammation in vitro</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>June</issue><keywords><keyword>SR9009</keyword><keyword>apolipoprotein E</keyword><keyword>brain endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcell.2021.668296</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Autocrine Effects of Brain Endothelial Cell-Produced Human Apolipoprotein E on Metabolism and Inflammation in vitro.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;Proliferation;TEER</label><abstract>Reports of APOE4 -associated neurovascular dysfunction during aging and in neurodegenerative disorders has led to ongoing research to identify underlying mechanisms. In this study, we focused on whether the APOE genotype of brain endothelial cells modulates their own phenotype. We utilized a modified primary mouse brain endothelial cell isolation protocol that enabled us to perform experiments without subculture. Through initial characterization we found, that compared to APOE3 , APOE4 brain endothelial cells produce less apolipoprotein E (apoE) and have altered metabolic and inflammatory gene expression profiles. Further analysis revealed APOE4 brain endothelial cultures have higher preference for oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis and, accordingly, higher markers of mitochondrial activity. Mitochondrial activity generates reactive oxygen species, and, with APOE4 , there were higher mitochondrial superoxide levels, lower levels of antioxidants related to heme and glutathione and higher markers/outcomes of oxidative damage to proteins and lipids. In parallel, or resulting from reactive oxygen species, there was greater inflammation in APOE4 brain endothelial cells including higher chemokine levels and immune cell adhesion under basal conditions and after low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. In addition, paracellular permeability was higher in APOE4 brain endothelial cells in basal conditions and after high-dose LPS treatment. Finally, we found that a nuclear receptor Rev-Erb agonist, SR9009, improved functional metabolic markers, lowered inflammation and modulated paracellular permeability at baseline and following LPS treatment in APOE4 brain endothelial cells. Together, our data suggest that autocrine signaling of apoE in brain endothelial cells represents a novel cellular mechanism for how APOE regulates neurovascular function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colunga Biancatelli, Ruben M.

To better understand the direct effects of HCl on pulmonary endothelial function, we studied the characteristics of HCl-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in primary cultures of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), defined the involved molecular pathways, and tested the potentially beneficial effects of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors. HCl impaired barrier function in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and was associated with activation of Protein Kinase B (AKT), Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), as well as loss of plasmalemmal VE-cadherin, rearrangement of cortical actin, and appearance of inter-endothelial gaps. Pre-treatment or post-treatment of HLMVEC with AUY-922, a third-generation HSP90 inhibitor, prevented and restored HCl-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. AUY-922 increased the expression of HSP70 and inhibited the activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT. AUY-922 also prevented the HCl-induced activation of RhoA and MLC2 and the internalization of plasmalemmal VE-cadherin. We conclude that, by increasing the expression of cytoprotective proteins, interfering with actomyosin contractility, and enhancing the expression of junction proteins, inhibition of HSP90 may represent a useful approach for the management of HCl-induced endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Chen, Jiaqi</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lncrsph9-4 facilitates meningitic escherichia coli-caused blood–brain barrier disruption via mir-17-5p/mmp3 axis</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>22</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Brain microvascular endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>LncRSPH9-4</keyword><keyword>MMP3</keyword><keyword>MiR-17-5p</keyword><keyword>Tight junctions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22126343</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LncRSPH9-4 Facilitates Meningitic Escherichia coli-Caused Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption via miR-17-5p-MMP3 Axis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms22126343</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) constitute the structural and functional basis for the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and play essential roles in bacterial meningitis. Although the BBB integrity regulation has been under extensive investigation, there is little knowledge regarding the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this event. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of one potential lncRNA, lncRSPH9-4, in meningitic E. coli infection of BMECs. LncRSPH9-4 was cytoplasm located and significantly up-regulated in meningitic E. coli-infected hBMECs. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measurement and Western blot assay demonstrated lncRSPH9-4 overexpression in hBMECs mediated the BBB integrity disruption. By RNA-sequencing analysis, 639 mRNAs and 299 miRNAs were significantly differentiated in response to lncRSPH9-4 overexpression. We further found lncRSPH9-4 regulated the permeability in hBMECs by competitively sponging miR-17-5p, thereby increasing MMP3 expression, which targeted the intercellular tight junctions. Here we reported the infection-induced lncRSPH9-4 aggravated disruption of the tight junctions in hBMECs, probably through the miR-17-5p/MMP3 axis. This finding provides new insights into the function of lncRNAs in BBB integrity during meningitic E. coli infection and provides the novel nucleic acid targets for future treatment of bacterial meningitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vigh, Judit P.</author><author>Kincses, András</author><author>Ozgür, Burak</author><author>Walter, Fruzsina R.</author><author>Santa-Maria, Ana Raquel</author><author>Valkai, Sándor</author><author>Vastag, Mónika</author><author>Neuhaus, Winfried</author><author>Brodin, Birger</author><author>Dér, András</author><author>Deli, Mária A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement across the Blood–Brain Barrier: A Critical Review of Methods</title><secondary-title>Micromachines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Micromachines</full-title></periodical><pages>685</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>cell culture insert</keyword><keyword>claims in</keyword><keyword>electrodes</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>epithelial cell</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>lab-on-a-chip</keyword><keyword>mdpi stays neutral</keyword><keyword>publisher</keyword><keyword>s note</keyword><keyword>transendothelial electrical resistance</keyword><keyword>viscosity</keyword><keyword>with regard to jurisdictional</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/mi12060685</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement across the Blood–Brain Barrier A Critical Review of Methods.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fmi12060685</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;Review;TEER</label><abstract>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) represents the tightest endothelial barrier within the cardiovascular system characterized by very low ionic permeability. Our aim was to describe the setups, electrodes, and instruments to measure electrical resistance across brain microvessels and culture models of the BBB, as well as critically assess the influence of often neglected physical and technical parameters such as temperature, viscosity, current density generated by different electrode types, surface size, circumference, and porosity of the culture insert membrane. We demonstrate that these physical and technical parameters greatly influence the measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance/resistivity (TEER) across BBB culture models resulting in severalfold differences in TEER values of the same biological model, especially in the low-TEER range. We show that elevated culture medium viscosity significantly increases, while higher membrane porosity decreases TEER values. TEER data measured by chopstick electrodes can be threefold higher than values measured by chamber electrodes due to different electrode size and geometry, resulting in current distribution inhomogeneity. An additional shunt resistance at the circumference of culture inserts results in lower TEER values. A detailed description of setups and technical parameters is crucial for the correct interpretation and comparison of TEER values of BBB models.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pao, Hsin-Ping</author><author>Liao, Wen-I.</author><author>Tang, Shih-En</author><author>Wu, Shu-Yu</author><author>Huang, Kun-Lun</author><author>Chu, Shi-Jye</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suppression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by 4-PBA Protects Against Hyperoxia-Induced Acute Lung Injury via Up-Regulating Claudin-4 Expression</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>May</issue><keywords><keyword>4-phenyl butyric acid</keyword><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>claudin-4</keyword><keyword>endoplasmic reticulum stress</keyword><keyword>hyperoxia</keyword><keyword>oxidative stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2021.674316</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Suppression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by 4-PBA Protects Against Hyperoxia-Induced Acute Lung Injury via Up-Regulating Claudin-4 Expression.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2021.674316</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that disrupts ER function can occur in response to a wide variety of cellular stress factors leads to the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER. Many studies have shown that ER stress amplified inflammatory reactions and was involved in various inflammatory diseases. However, little is known regarding the role of ER stress in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI). This study investigated the influence of ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), in mice with HALI. Treatment with 4-PBA in the hyperoxia groups significantly prolonged the survival, decreased lung edema, and reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators, lactate dehydrogenase, and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and increased claudin-4 protein expression in lung tissue. Moreover, 4-PBA reduced the ER stress-related protein expression, NF-κB activation, and apoptosis in the lung tissue. In in vitro study, 4-PBA also exerted a similar effect in hyperoxia-exposed mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12). However, when claudin-4 siRNA was administrated in mice and MLE-12 cells, the protective effect of 4-PBA was abrogated. These results suggested that 4-PBA protected against hyperoxia-induced ALI via enhancing claudin-4 expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanz-rubio, David</author><author>Khalyfa, Abdelnaby</author><author>Qiao, Zhuanhong</author><author>Ullate, Jorge</author><author>Marin, Jos M</author><author>Kheirandish-gozal, Leila</author><author>Gozal, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-Selective Altered Cargo Properties of Extracellular Vesicles Following In Vitro Exposures to Intermittent Hypoxia</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>5604</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>adipocytes</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>claims in</keyword><keyword>cvd</keyword><keyword>evs</keyword><keyword>exosomes</keyword><keyword>extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>insulin resistance</keyword><keyword>intermittent hypoxia</keyword><keyword>macrophages</keyword><keyword>mdpi stays neutral</keyword><keyword>osa</keyword><keyword>publisher</keyword><keyword>s note</keyword><keyword>thp1 cells</keyword><keyword>with regard to jurisdictional</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22115604</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cell-Selective Altered Cargo Properties of Extracellular Vesicles Following In Vitro Exposures to Intermittent Hypoxia.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms22115604</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying these morbidities remain poorly delineated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communications, play pivotal roles in a multitude of physiological and pathological processes, and could mediate IH-induced cellular effects. Here, the effects of IH on human primary cells and the release of EVs were examined. Microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d), THP1 monocytes, THP1 macrophages M0, THP1 macrophages M1, THP1 macrophages M2, pre-adipocytes, and differentiated adipocytes (HAd) were exposed to either room air (RA) or IH for 24 h. Secreted EVs were isolated and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blotting. The effects of each of the cell-derived EVs on endothelial cell (EC) monolayer barrier integrity, on naïve THP1 macrophage polarity, and on adipocyte insulin sensitivity were also evaluated. IH did not alter EVs cell quantal release, but IH-EVs derived from HMVEC-d (p &lt; 0.01), THP1 M0 (p &lt; 0.01) and HAd (p &lt; 0.05) significantly disrupted HMVEC-d monolayer integrity, particularly after H2O2 pre-conditioning. IH-EVs from HMVEC-d and THP1 M0 elicited M2-polarity changes did not alter insulin sensitivity responses. IH induces cell-selective changes in EVs cargo, which primarily seem to target the emergence of endothelial dysfunction. Thus, changes in EVs cargo from selected cell sources in vivo may play causal roles in some of the adverse outcomes associated with OSA</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Qing</author><author>De Vries, Maaike</author><author>Okechukwu Nwozor, Kingsley</author><author>Noordhoek, Jacobien A.</author><author>Brandsma, Corry-Anke</author><author>Boezen, Marike</author><author>Heijink, Irene</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A protective effect of FAM13A in human bronchial epithelial cells upon exposure to cigarette smoke</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Physiology</full-title></periodical><issue>June</issue><keywords><keyword>COPD-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</keyword><keyword>CXCL8</keyword><keyword>FAM13A</keyword><keyword>airway epithelium</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>copd-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</keyword><keyword>cxcl8</keyword><keyword>fam13a</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.pa2396</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://A Protective Role of FAM13A in Human Airway Epithelial Cells Upon Exposure to Cigarette Smoke Extract.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.690936</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation upon inhalation of noxious particles, e.g., cigarette smoke. FAM13A is one of the genes often found to be associated with COPD, however its function in the pathophysiology of COPD is incompletely understood. We studied its role in airway epithelial barrier integrity and cigarette smoke-induced epithelial responses. Materials and Methods: Protein level and localization of FAM13A was assessed with immunohistochemistry in lung tissue from COPD patients and non-COPD controls. In vitro, FAM13A expression was determined in the absence or presence of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) from COPD patients and controls by western blotting. FAM13A was overexpressed in cell line 16HBE14o- and its effect on barrier function was monitored real-time by electrical resistance. Expression of junctional protein E-cadherin and β-catenin was assessed by western blotting. The secretion of neutrophil attractant CXCL8 upon CSE exposure was measured by ELISA. Results: FAM13A was strongly expressed in airway epithelium, but significantly weaker in airways of COPD patients compared to non-COPD controls. In COPD-derived AECs, but not those of controls, FAM13A was significantly downregulated by CSE. 16HBE14o- cells overexpressing FAM13A built up epithelial resistance significantly more rapidly, which was accompanied by higher E-cadherin expression and reduced CSE-induced CXCL8 levels. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the expression of FAM13A is lower in airway epithelium of COPD patients compared to non-COPD controls. In addition, cigarette smoking selectively downregulates airway epithelial expression of FAM13A in COPD patients. This may have important consequences for the pathophysiology of COPD, as the more rapid build-up of epithelial resistance upon FAM13A overexpression suggests improved (re)constitution of barrier function. The reduced epithelial secretion of CXCL8 upon CSE-induced damage suggests that lower FAM13A expression upon cigarette smoking may facilitate epithelial-driven neutrophilia.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bolitho, Christine</author><author>Moscova, Michelle</author><author>Baxter, Robert C.</author><author>Marsh, Deborah J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Amphiregulin increases migration and proliferation of epithelial ovarian cancer cells by inducing its own expression via PI3-kinase signaling.</title><secondary-title>Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology</full-title></periodical><pages>104743</pages><keywords><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3-K)</keyword><keyword>amphiregulin (AREG)</keyword><keyword>epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)</keyword><keyword>ovarian cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mce.2021.111338</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Amphiregulin increases migration and proliferation of epithelial ovarian cancer cells by inducing its own expression via PI3-kinase signaling..pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.111338</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and its expression has been found to correlate with advanced stage and poor prognosis. The EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) has been investigated as a target for human cancer therapy and is known to have an autocrine role in many cancers. A cytokine array identified AREG as one of several cytokines upregulated by EGF in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) dependent manner in EOC cells. To investigate the functional role of AREG in EOC, its effect on cellular migration and proliferation was assessed in two EOC cells lines, OV167 and SKOV3. AREG increased both migration and proliferation of EOC cell line models through activation of PI3-K signaling, but independent of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Through an AREG autocrine loop mediated via PI3-K, upregulation of AREG led to increased levels of both AREG transcript and secreted AREG, while downregulation of endogenous AREG decreased the ability of exogenous AREG to induce cell migration and proliferation. Further, inhibition of endogenous AREG activity or metalloproteinase activity decreased EGF-induced EOC migration and proliferation, indicating a role for soluble endogenous AREG in mediating the functional effects of EGFR in inducing migration and proliferation in EOC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hucklesby, James J.

Despite widespread use of these systems individually, direct comparisons between these platforms have not been published. To compare these instruments, the responses of human brain endothelial monolayers to TNFα and IL1β were measured on all three platforms simultaneously. All instruments detected transient changes in impedance in response to the cytokines, although the response magnitude varied, with ECIS being the most sensitive. ECIS and cellZscope were also able to attribute responses to particular endothelial barrier components by modelling the multifrequency impedance data acquired by these instruments; in contrast the limited frequency xCELLigence data cannot be modelled. Consistent with its superior impedance sensing, ECIS exhibited a greater capacity than cellZscope to distinguish between subtle changes in modelled endothelial monolayer properties. The reduced resolving ability of the cellZscope platform may be due to its electrode configuration, which is necessary to allow access to the basolateral compartment, an important advantage of this instrument. Collectively, this work demonstrates that instruments must be carefully selected to ensure they are appropriate for the experimental questions being asked when assessing endothelial barrier properties.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoepel, Willianne</author><author>Chen, Hung-Jen</author><author>Geyer, Chiara E.</author><author>Allahverdiyeva, Sona</author><author>Manz, Xue D.</author><author>de Taeye, Steven W.</author><author>Aman, Jurjan</author><author>Mes, Lynn</author><author>Steenhuis, Maurice</author><author>Griffith, Guillermo R.</author><author>Bonta, Peter I.</author><author>Brouwer, Philip J.M.</author><author>Caniels, Tom G.</author><author>van der Straten, Karlijn</author><author>Golebski, Korneliusz</author><author>Jonkers, René E.</author><author>Larsen, Mads D.</author><author>Linty, Federica</author><author>Nouta, Jan</author><author>van Roomen, Cindy P.A.A.</author><author>van Baarle, Frank E.H.P.</author><author>van Drunen, Cornelis M.</author><author>Wolbink, Gertjan</author><author>Vlaar, Alexander P.J.</author><author>de Bree, Godelieve J.</author><author>Sanders, Rogier W.</author><author>Willemsen, Lisa</author><author>Neele, Annette E.</author><author>van de Beek, Diederik</author><author>Rispens, Theo</author><author>Wuhrer, Manfred</author><author>Bogaard, Harm Jan</author><author>van Gils, Marit J.</author><author>Vidarsson, Gestur</author><author>de Winther, Menno</author><author>den Dunnen, Jeroen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High titers and low fucosylation of early human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG promote inflammation by alveolar macrophages</title><secondary-title>Science Translational Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science Translational Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>eabf8654</pages><volume>8654</volume><issue>May</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33979301</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scitranslmed.abf8654</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://High titers and low fucosylation of early human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG promote inflammation by alveolar macrophages.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscitranslmed.abf8654</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;Virology</label><abstract>Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific IgG in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Notably, low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified Fcγ Receptor (FcγR) IIa and FcγRIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by anti-spike IgG can be specifically counteracted by fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk kinase.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schoenwaelder, Nina</author><author>Salewski, Inken</author><author>Engel, Nadja</author><author>Krause, Mareike</author><author>Schneider, Björn</author><author>Müller, Michael</author><author>Riess, Christin</author><author>Lemcke, Heiko</author><author>Skorska, Anna</author><author>Grosse-Thie, Christina</author><author>Junghanss, Christian</author><author>Maletzki, Claudia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The individual effects of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors on head and neck cancer cells—a systematic analysis</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Combination strategies</keyword><keyword>Immunogenic cell death</keyword><keyword>Targeted therapy</keyword><keyword>Xenograft model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers13102396</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Individual Effects of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors on Head and Neck Cancer Cells—A Systematic Analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcancers13102396</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi´s) display cytotoxic activity against different malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). By coordinating the DNA damage response, these substances may be combined with cytostatics to enhance cytotoxicity. Here, we investigated the influence of different CDKi´s (palbociclib, dinaciclib, THZ1) on two HNSCC cell lines in monotherapy and combination therapy with clinically-approved drugs (5-FU, Cisplatin, cetuximab). Apoptosis/necrosis, cell cycle, invasiveness, senescence, radiation-induced γ-H2AX DNA double-strand breaks, and effects on the actin filament were studied. Furthermore, the potential to increase tumor immunogenicity was assessed by analyzing Calreticulin translocation and immune relevant surface markers. Finally, an in vivo mouse model was used to analyze the effect of dinaciclib and Cisplatin combination therapy. Dinaciclib, palbociclib, and THZ1 displayed anti-neoplastic activity after low-dose treatment, while the two latter substances slightly enhanced radiosensitivity. Dinaciclib decelerated wound healing, decreased invasiveness, and induced MHC-I, accompanied by high amounts of surface-bound Calreticulin. Numbers of early and late apoptotic cells increased initially (24 h), while necrosis dominated afterward. Antitumoral effects of the selective CDKi palbociclib were weaker, but combinations with 5-FU potentiated effects of the monotherapy. Additionally, CDKi and CDKi/chemotherapy combinations induced MHC I, indicative of enhanced immunogenicity. The in vivo studies revealed a cell line-specific response with best tumor growth control in the combination approach. Global acting CDKi’s should be further investigated as targeting agents for HNSCC, either individually or in combination with selected drugs. The ability of dinaciclib to increase the immunogenicity of tumor cells renders this substance a particularly interesting candidate for immune-based oncological treatment regimens.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quijada, Hector</author><author>Bermudez, Tadeo</author><author>Kempf, Carrie L.</author><author>Valera, Daniel G.</author><author>Garcia, Alexander N.</author><author>Camp, Sara M.</author><author>Song, Jin H.</author><author>Franco, Evelyn</author><author>Burt, Jessica K.</author><author>Sun, Belinda</author><author>Mascarenhas, Joseph B.</author><author>Burns, Kimberlie</author><author>Gaber, Amir</author><author>Oita, Radu C.</author><author>Reyes Hernon, Vivian</author><author>Barber, Christy</author><author>Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana</author><author>Sun, Xiaoguang</author><author>Cress, Anne E.</author><author>Martin, Diego</author><author>Liu, Zhonglin</author><author>Desai, Ankit A.</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author><author>Bime, Christian</author><author>Sammani, Saad</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial eNAMPT amplifies pre-clinical acute lung injury: efficacy of an eNAMPT-neutralising monoclonal antibody</title><secondary-title>European Respiratory Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Respiratory Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>2002536</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/13993003.02536-2020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial eNAMPT amplifies pre-clinical acute lung injury efficacy of an eNAMPT-neutralising monoclonal antibody.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02536-2020</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>RATIONALE The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the serious unmet need for effective therapies that reduce ARDS mortality. We explored whether extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and a master regulator of innate immunity and inflammation, is a potential ARDS therapeutic target. METHODS Wild type C57BL/6J or endothelial cell (EC)-cNAMPT-/- knockout mice (targeted EC NAMPT deletion) were exposed to either a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (&quot;one-hit&quot;) or a combined LPS/ventilator (&quot;two-hit&quot;)-induced acute inflammatory lung injury model. A NAMPT-specific mAb imaging probe (99mTc-ProNamptorTM) was used to detect NAMPT expression in lung tissues. Either an eNAMPT-neutralising goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) or a humanised monoclonal antibody (ALT-100 mAb) were utilised in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS Immunohistochemical, biochemical, and imaging studies validated time-dependent increases in NAMPT lung tissue expression in both preclinical ARDS models. Intravenous delivery of either eNAMPT-neutralising pAb/mAb significantly attenuated inflammatory lung injury (H &amp; E staining, BAL protein, BAL PMNs, plasma IL-6) in both preclinical models. In vitro human lung EC studies demonstrated eNAMPT-neutralising antibodies (pAb, mAb) to strongly abrogate eNAMPT-induced TLR4 pathway activation and EC barrier disruption. In vivo studies in wild type and EC-cNAMPT-/- mice confirmed a highly significant contribution of EC-derived NAMPT to the severity of inflammatory lung injury in both preclinical ARDS models. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight both the role of EC-derived eNAMPT and the potential for biologic targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway. In combination with predictive eNAMPT biomarker and NAMPT genotyping assays, this offers the opportunity to identify high-risk ARDS subjects for delivery of personalised medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Starikova, Eleonora</author><author>Mammedova, Jennet</author><author>Ozhiganova, Arina</author><author>Lebedeva, Aleksandra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protective Role of Mytilus edulis Hydrolysate in Lipopolysaccharide-Galactosamine Acute Liver Injury</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>May</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphar.2021.667572</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Protective Role of Mytilus edulis Hydrolysate in Lipopolysaccharide-Galactosamine Acute Liver Injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.667572</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Acute liver injury in its terminal phase trigger systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multiple organ failure. An uncontrolled inflammatory reaction is difficult to treat and contributes to high mortality. Therefore, to solve this problem a search for new therapeutic approaches remains urgent. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of M. edulis hydrolysate (N2-01) against Lipopolysaccharide-D-Galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN)-induced murine acute liver injure and the underlying mechanisms. N2-01 analysis, using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) metabolomic and proteomic platforms, confirmed composition, molecular-weight distribution, and high reproducibility between M. edulis hydrolysate manufactured batches. N2-01 efficiently protected mice against LPS/D-GalN-induced acute liver injury. The most prominent result (100% survival rate) was obtained by the constant subcutaneous administration of small doses of the drug. N2-01 decreased Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression from 4.648 ± 0.445 to 1.503 ± 0.091 Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in activated Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) from 7.473 ± 0.666 to 2.980 ± 0.130 ng/ml in vitro. The drug increased Nitric Oxide (NO) production by HUVECs from 27.203 ± 2.890 to 69.200 ± 4.716 MFI but significantly decreased inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) expression from 24.030 ± 2.776 to 15.300 ± 1.290 MFI and NO production by murine peritoneal lavage cells from 6.777 ± 0.373 µm to 2.175 ± 0.279 µm. The capability of the preparation to enhance the endothelium barrier function and to reduce vascular permeability was confirmed in Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensor (ECIS) test in vitro and Miles assay in vivo. These results suggest N2-01 as a promising agent for treating a wide range of conditions associated with uncontrolled inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sung, Junsik</author><author>Wang, Lixin</author><author>Long, Dingpei</author><author>Yang, Chunhua</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PepT1-Knockout Mice Harbor a Protective Metabolome Beneficial for Intestinal Wound Healing</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology</full-title></periodical><issue>March</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpgi.00299.2020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PepT1-Knockout Mice Harbor a Protective Metabolome Beneficial for Intestinal Wound Healing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.00299.2020</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Genetic knockout (KO) of peptide transporter-1 (PepT1) protein is known to provide resistance to acute colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in mouse models. However, it was unclear which molecule(s) or pathway(s) formed the basis for these protective effects. Recently, we demonstrated that the PepT1 -/- microbiota is sufficient to protect against colitis and CAC. Given that PepT1 KO alters the gut microbiome and thereby changes the intestinal metabolites that are ultimately reflected in the feces, we investigated the fecal metabolites of our PepT1 KO mice. Using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted-metabolomics technique, we found that the fecal metabolites were significantly different between the KO and normal wild-type (WT) mice. Among the altered fecal metabolites, tuberonic acid (TA) was seven-fold higher in KO mouse feces than in WT mouse feces. Accordingly, we studied whether the increased TA could direct an anti-inflammatory effect. Using in vitro models, we discovered that TA not only prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in macrophages but also improved the epithelial cell healing processes. Our results suggest that TA, and possibly other fecal metabolites, play a crucial role in the pathway(s) associated with the anti-colitis effects of PepT1 KO.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vreeken, Dianne</author><author>Bruikman, Caroline Suzanne</author><author>Stam, Wendy</author><author>Martinus, Stefan</author><author>Cox, Leonardus</author><author>Nagy, Zsófia</author><author>Zhang, Huayu</author><author>Gils, Janine Maria Van</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Downregulation of Endothelial Plexin A4 Under Inflammatory Conditions Impairs Vascular Integrity</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>May</issue><keywords><keyword>atherosclerosis</keyword><keyword>endothelial function</keyword><keyword>frontiers in cardiovascular medicine</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>neuroimmune guidance cues</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>plexin</keyword><keyword>semaphorin</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcvm.2021.633609</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Downregulation of Endothelial Plexin A4 Under Inflammatory Conditions Impairs Vascular Integrity.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Objective: Besides hyperlipidemia, inflammation is an important determinant in the initiation and the progression of atherosclerosis. As Neuroimmune Guidance Cues (NGCs) are emerging as regulators of atherosclerosis, we set out to investigate the expression and function of inflammation-regulated NGCs. Methods and results: NGC expression in human monocytes and endothelial cells was assessed using a publicly available RNA dataset. Next, the mRNA levels of expressed NGCs were analyzed in primary human monocytes and endothelial cells after stimulation with IL1β or TNFα. Upon stimulation a total of 14 and 19 NGCs in monocytes and endothelial cells, respectively, were differentially expressed. Since plexin A4 (PLXNA4) was strongly downregulated in endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions, the role of PLXNA4 in endothelial function was investigated. Knockdown of PLXNA4 in endothelial cells markedly impaired the integrity of the monolayer leading to more elongated cells with an inflammatory phenotype. In addition, these cells showed an increase in actin stress fibers and decreased cell-cell junctions. Functional assays revealed decreased barrier function and capillary network formation of the endothelial cells, while vascular leakage and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes was increased. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that pro-inflammatory conditions result in differential expression of NGCs in endothelial cells and monocytes, both culprit cell types in atherosclerosis. Specifically, endothelial PLXNA4 is reduced upon inflammation, while PLXNA4 maintains endothelial barrier function thereby preventing vascular leakage of fluids as well as cells. Taken together, PLXNA4 may well have a causal role in atherogenesis that deserves further investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Young-mee</author><author>Krantz, Sarah</author><author>Jambusaria, Ankit</author><author>Toth, Peter T</author><author>Gunarathna, Isuru</author><author>Park, Gye Young</author><author>Rehman, Jalees</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitofusin-2 stabilizes adherens junctions and suppresses endothelial inflammation via modulation of β-catenin signaling</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2736</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute inflammation</keyword><keyword>Adherens junctions</keyword><keyword>Circulation</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-021-23047-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mitofusin-2 stabilizes adherens junctions and suppresses endothelial inflammation via modulation of β-catenin signaling.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23047-6</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Endothelial barrier integrity is ensured by the stability of the adherens junction (AJ) complexes comprised of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin as well as accessory proteins such as β-catenin and p120-catenin. Disruption of the endothelial barrier due to disassembly of AJs results in tissue edema and the influx of inflammatory cells. Using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, we observe that the mitochondrial protein Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) co-localizes at the plasma membrane with VE-cadherin and β-catenin in endothelial cells during homeostasis. Upon inflammatory stimulation, Mfn2 is sulfenylated, the Mfn2/β-catenin complex disassociates from the AJs and Mfn2 accumulates in the nucleus where Mfn2 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Endothelial-specific deletion of Mfn2 results in inflammatory activation, indicating an anti-inflammatory role of Mfn2 in vivo. Our results suggest that Mfn2 acts in a non-canonical manner to suppress the inflammatory response by stabilizing cell–cell adherens junctions and by binding to the transcriptional activator β-catenin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lay, Abigail C.</author><author>Hale, Lorna J.</author><author>Stowell-Connolly, Holly</author><author>Pope, Robert J.P.</author><author>Nair, Viji</author><author>Ju, Wenjun</author><author>Marquez, Eva</author><author>Rollason, Ruth</author><author>Hurcombe, Jenny A.</author><author>Hayes, Bryony</author><author>Roberts, Timothy</author><author>Gillam, Lawrence</author><author>Allington, Jonathan</author><author>Nelson, Robert G.</author><author>Kretzler, Matthias</author><author>Holly, Jeff M.P.</author><author>Perks, Claire M.</author><author>McArdle, Craig A.</author><author>Welsh, Gavin I.</author><author>Coward, Richard J.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IGFBP-1 expression is reduced in human type 2 diabetic glomeruli and modulates β1-integrin/FAK signalling in human podocytes</title><secondary-title>Diabetologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetologia</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Diabetic nephropathy</keyword><keyword>FAK</keyword><keyword>Fkhr</keyword><keyword>FoxO1</keyword><keyword>Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>IGFBP-1</keyword><keyword>Motility</keyword><keyword>Podocyte</keyword><keyword>β1-integrin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Diabetologia</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00125-021-05427-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://IGFBP-1 expression is reduced in human type 2 diabetic glomeruli and modulates β1-integrin FAK signalling in human podocytes.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Aims/hypothesis: Podocyte loss or injury is one of the earliest features observed in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure worldwide. Dysfunction in the IGF axis, including in IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), is associated with DKD, particularly in the early stages of disease progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles of IGFBPs in the development of type 2 DKD, focusing on podocytes. Methods: IGFBP expression was analysed in the Pima DKD cohort, alongside data from the Nephroseq database, and in ex vivo human glomeruli. Conditionally immortalised human podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells were studied in vitro, where IGFBP-1 expression was analysed using quantitative PCR and ELISAs. Cell responses to IGFBPs were investigated using migration, cell survival and adhesion assays; electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing; western blotting; and high-content automated imaging. Results: Data from the Pima DKD cohort and from the Nephroseq database demonstrated a significant reduction in glomerular IGFBP-1 in the early stages of human type 2 DKD. In the glomerulus, IGFBP-1 was predominantly expressed in podocytes and controlled by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) activity. In vitro, IGFBP-1 signalled to podocytes via β1-integrins, resulting in increased phosphorylation of focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), increasing podocyte motility, adhesion, electrical resistance across the adhesive cell layer and cell viability. Conclusions/interpretation: This work identifies a novel role for IGFBP-1 in the regulation of podocyte function and that the glomerular expression of IGFBP-1 is reduced in the early stages of type 2 DKD, via reduced FoxO1 activity. Thus, we hypothesise that strategies to maintain glomerular IGFBP-1 levels may be beneficial in maintaining podocyte function early in DKD.

The function of this netrin-4 in vascular biology after development has remained unclear. We found that the expression of netrin-4 is highly regulated in endothelial cells and is important for quiescent healthy endothelium. Netrin-4 expression is upregulated in endothelial cells cultured under laminar flow conditions, while endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha resulted in decreased netrin-4 expression. Targeted reduction of netrin-4 in endothelial cells resulted in increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Besides, these endothelial cells were more prone to monocyte adhesion and showed impaired barrier function, measured with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, as well as in an ‘organ-on-a-chip’ microfluidic system. Importantly, endothelial cells with reduced levels of netrin-4 showed increased expression of the senescence-associated markers cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1 and -2A, an increased cell size and decreased ability to proliferate. Consistent with the gene expression profile, netrin-4 reduction was accompanied with more senescent associated β-galactosidase activity, which could be rescued by adding netrin-4 protein. Finally, using human decellularized kidney extracellular matrix scaffolds, we found that pre-treatment of the scaffolds with netrin-4 increased numbers of endothelial cells adhering to the matrix, showing a pro-survival effect of netrin-4. Taken together, netrin-4 acts as an anti-senescence and anti-inflammation factor in endothelial cell function and our results provide insights as to maintain endothelial homeostasis and supporting vascular health.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palliyage, Gayathri H.</author><author>Hussein, Noor</author><author>Mimlitz, Michael</author><author>Weeder, Catherine</author><author>Alnasser, Marya H A</author><author>Ekpenyong, Andrew</author><author>Tiwari, Amit K</author><author>Chauhan, Harsh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel Curcumin-Resveratrol Solid Nanoparticles Synergistically Inhibit Proliferation of Melanoma Cells</title><secondary-title>Pharmaceutical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmaceutical Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-021-03043-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-021-03043-7</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Proliferation</label><abstract>Polyphenols such as curcumin (Cur) and resveratrol (Res) have been recently shown to have potential to inhibit proliferation of highly aggressive melanoma cells. This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of a topical delivery system, using a solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded delivery systems, that can enhance the skin penetration and anti-cancer efficacy of combination of these polyphenols. Negatively charged Cur-Res SLNs with a mean diameter of 180.2 ± 7.7 nm were prepared using high shear homogenization method. Cur-Res SLNs were found to be stable up to 2 weeks under 4°C. The in vitro release study showed that Res was released five time more than curcumin. The permeability of resveratrol was about 1.67 times that of curcumin from the SLN-gel formulation which was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than from SLN suspension. More than 70% of Cur-Res SLNs were bound to skin locally in a skin binding study suggesting potentially utility of Cur-Res SLNs in the treatment of localized melanoma. In fact, the electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measurements suggested that Cur-Res combination has potential to stop cell migration of B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, both, Cur-Res SLNs and Cur-Res solution at the ratio of 3:1 demonstrated a strong synergistic inhibition of SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell proliferation. Further evaluation of Cur-Res SLNs in vivo melanoma models are warranted to establish the clinical utility of Cur-Res formulations in melanoma therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guerra, Michael H.</author><author>Yumnamcha, Thangal</author><author>Ebrahim, Abdul Shukkur</author><author>Berger, Elizabeth A.</author><author>Singh, Lalit Pukhrambam</author><author>Ibrahim, Ahmed S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time monitoring the effect of cytopathic hypoxia on retinal pigment epithelial barrier functionality using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (Ecis) biosensor technology</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>22</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>ARPE-19</keyword><keyword>Age related macular degeneration (AMD)</keyword><keyword>Alpha resistance</keyword><keyword>Barrier integrity</keyword><keyword>Capacitance</keyword><keyword>CoCl2</keyword><keyword>Cytopathic hypoxia</keyword><keyword>Diabetic macular edema (DME)</keyword><keyword>ECIS modeling</keyword><keyword>Impedance</keyword><keyword>Rb resistance</keyword><keyword>Retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE)</keyword><keyword>Seahorse</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22094568</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Real-Time Monitoring the Effect of Cytopathic Hypoxia on Retinal Pigment Epithelial Barrier Functionality Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) Biosensor Technology.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;Modeling;Proliferation</label><abstract>Disruption of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE barrier integrity is a hallmark feature of various retinal blinding diseases, including diabetic macular edema and age-related macular degen-eration, but the underlying causes and pathophysiology are not completely well-defined. One of the most conserved phenomena in biology is the progressive decline in mitochondrial function with aging leading to cytopathic hypoxia, where cells are unable to use oxygen for energy production. Therefore, this study aimed to thoroughly investigate the role of cytopathic hypoxia in compromising the barrier functionality of RPE cells. We used Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) system to monitor precisely in real time the barrier integrity of RPE cell line (ARPE-19) after treatment with various concentrations of cytopathic hypoxia-inducing agent, Cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2). We further investigated how the resistance across ARPE-19 cells changes across three separate parameters: Rb (the electrical resistance between ARPE-19 cells), α (the resistance between the ARPE-19 and its substrate), and Cm (the capacitance of the ARPE-19 cell membrane). The viability of the ARPE-19 cells and mitochondrial bioenergetics were quantified with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and seahorse technology, respectively. ECIS measurement showed that CoCl2 reduced the total impedance of ARPE-19 cells in a dose dependent manner across all tested frequencies. Specifically, the ECIS program’s modelling demonstrated that CoCl2 affected Rb as it begins to drastically decrease earlier than α or Cm, although ARPE-19 cells’ viability was not compromised. Using seahorse technology, all three concentrations of CoCl2 significantly impaired basal, maximal, and ATP-linked respirations of ARPE-19 cells but did not affect proton leak and non-mitochondrial bioenergetic. Concordantly, the expression of a major paracellular tight junction protein (ZO-1) was reduced significantly with CoCl2- treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that the ARPE-19 cells have distinct dielectric properties in response to cytopathic hypoxia in which disruption of barrier integrity between ARPE-19 cells precedes any changes in cells’ viability, cell-substrate contacts, and cell membrane permeability. Such differences can be used in screening of selective agents that improve the assembly of RPE tight junction without compromising other RPE barrier parameters.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuhn, M.

Dairy cattle are routinely supplemented with the vitamin E analog α-tocopherol to mitigate the severity of oxidative stress. Nonetheless, oxidative stress remains a disease predisposing condition for many dairy cattle. A better method of optimizing the antioxidant functions of vitamin E is needed. α-Tocopherol is only 1 of 8 analogs of vitamin E, all of which have varying antioxidant properties in other mammals, albeit a shorter physiological half-life compared with α-tocopherol. A primary bovine mammary endothelial cell oxidant challenge model was used to determine functions of certain vitamin E analogs. The aim of this study was to determine if other analogs, namely γ-tocopherol or γ-tocotrienol, have antioxidative functions in bovine cells and if these functions may protect cellular viability and endothelial function from oxidant damage. Physiological (10 μM) and supraphysiological (50 μM) concentrations of γ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol had a greater capacity to reduce accumulated reactive oxygen species derived from a nitric oxide donating pro-oxidant antagonist, when compared with α-tocopherol, after 30 min to 6 h of treatment. Further, γ-tocotrienol (10 μM) decreased cell cytotoxicity to a greater amount than other analogs at like concentrations, whereas γ-tocopherol (10 μM) reduced lipid peroxidation and apoptosis more effectively than other analogs. Last, α-tocopherol (5 and 10 μM) and γ-tocopherol (5 and 10 μM) significantly slowed pro-oxidant induced loss of endothelial cell barrier integrity over a 48-h period using an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system. Concerningly, γ-tocotrienol drastically reduced the endothelial barrier integrity at only 5 μM despite no apparent effect on cellular viability at like concentrations. γ-Tocotrienol, however, was also the only analog to show significant cytotoxicity and reductions in viability at supraphysiological doses (25 and 50 μM). Our results suggest that γ-tocopherol has antioxidant activities that reduces cellular damage and loss of function due to oxidant challenge as effectively as α-tocopherol. These data set the foundation for further investigation into the antioxidant properties of vitamin E analogs in other bovine cells types or whole animal models.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karki, Pratap</author><author>Ke, Yunbo</author><author>Zhang, Chen Ou</author><author>Li, Yue</author><author>Tian, Yufeng</author><author>Son, Sophia</author><author>Yoshimura, Akihiko</author><author>Kaibuchi, Kozo</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G.</author><author>Birukova, Anna A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SOCS3 microtubule interaction via CLIP-170 and CLASP2 is critical for modulation of endothelial inflammation and lung injury</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>100239</pages><volume>296</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V</publisher><accession-num>33372035</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.RA120.014232</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SOCS3–microtubule interaction via CLIP-170 and CLASP2 is critical for modulation of endothelial inflammation and lung injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.014232</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 induce endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption and trigger an inflammatory response in part by activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. The protein suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is a negative regulator of JAK-STAT, but its role in modulation of lung EC barrier dysfunction caused by bacterial pathogens has not been investigated. Using human lung ECs and EC-specific SOCS3 knockout mice, we tested the hypothesis that SOCS3 confers microtubule (MT)-mediated protection against endothelial dysfunction. SOCS3 knockdown in cultured ECs or ECspecific SOCS3 knockout in mice resulted in exacerbated lung injury characterized by increased permeability and inflammation in response to IL-6 or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA). Ectopic expression of SOCS3 attenuated HKSAinduced EC dysfunction, and this effect required assembled MTs. SOCS3 was enriched in the MT fractions, and treatment with HKSA disrupted SOCS3 MT association. We discovered that in addition to its known partners gp130 and JAK2 SOCS3 interacts with MT plus-end binding proteins CLIP-170 and CLASP2 via its N-Terminal domain. The resulting SOCS3 CLIP-170/CLASP2 complex was essential for maximal SOCS3 anti-inflammatory effects. Both IL-6 and HKSA promoted MT disassembly and disrupted SOCS3 interaction with CLIP-170 and CLASP2. Moreover, knockdown of CLIP-170 or CLASP2 impaired SOCS3 JAK2 interaction and abolished the antiinflammatory effects of SOCS3. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time an interaction between SOCS3 and CLIP-170/CLASP2 and reveal that this interaction is essential to the protective effects of SOCS3 in lung endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Si Han</author><author>Tung, Tse Hua</author><author>Chiu, Sheng Po</author><author>Chou, Hsin Yi</author><author>Hung, Yu Han</author><author>Lai, Yi Ting</author><author>Lee, Yu Wei</author><author>Lee, Shiao Pieng</author><author>Lo, Chun Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detecting effects of low levels of fccp on stem cell micromotion and wound-healing migration by time-series capacitance measurement</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Capacitance</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>High frequency</keyword><keyword>Micromotion</keyword><keyword>Mitochondria</keyword><keyword>Wound-healing migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s21093017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Detecting Effects of Low Levels of FCCP on Stem Cell Micromotion and Wound-Healing Migration by Time-Series Capacitance Measurement.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/s21093017</url></web-urls></urls><label>Micromotion;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Electric cell–substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) has been used as a real-time impedancebased method to quantify cell behavior in tissue culture. The method is capable of measuring both the resistance and capacitance of a cell-covered microelectrode at various AC frequencies. In this study, we demonstrate the application of high-frequency capacitance measurement (f = 40 or 64 kHz) for the sensitive detection of both the micromotion and wound-healing migration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Impedance measurements of cell-covered electrodes upon the challenge of various concentrations of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), from 0.1 to 30 μM, were conducted using ECIS. FCCP is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thereby reducing mitochondrial ATP production. By numerically analyzing the time-series capacitance data, a dose-dependent decrease in hMSC micromotion and wound-healing migration was observed, and the effect was significantly detected at levels as low as 0.1 μM. While most reported works with ECIS use the resistance/impedance time series, our results suggest the potential use of high-frequency capacitance time series for assessing migratory cell behavior such as micromotion and wound-healing migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weng, Rueyhung R.</author><author>Lu, Hsuan-Hsuan</author><author>Lin, Chien-Ting</author><author>Fan, Chia-Chi</author><author>Lin, Rong-Shan</author><author>Huang, Tai-Chung</author><author>Lin, Shu-Yung</author><author>Huang, Yi-Jhen</author><author>Juan, Yi-Hsiu</author><author>Wu, Yi-Chieh</author><author>Hung, Zheng-Ci</author><author>Liu, Chi</author><author>Lin, Xuan-Hui</author><author>Hsieh, Wan-Chen</author><author>Chiu, Tzu-Yuan</author><author>Liao, Jung-Chi</author><author>Chiu, Yen-Ling</author><author>Chen, Shih-Yu</author><author>Yu, Chong-Jen</author><author>Tsai, Hsing-Chen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epigenetic modulation of immune synaptic-cytoskeletal networks potentiates γδ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in lung cancer</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>33846331</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-021-22433-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Epigenetic modulation of immune synaptic-cytoskeletal networks potentiates γδ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in lung cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22433-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>cytotoxicity</label><abstract>γδ T cells are a distinct subgroup of T cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune system and can attack cancer cells in an MHC-unrestricted manner. Trials of adoptive γδ T cell transfer in solid tumors have had limited success. Here, we show that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) upregulate surface molecules on cancer cells related to γδ T cell activation using quantitative surface proteomics. DNMTi treatment of human lung cancer potentiates tumor lysis by ex vivo-expanded Vδ1-enriched γδ T cells. Mechanistically, DNMTi enhances immune synapse formation and mediates cytoskeletal reorganization via coordinated alterations of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. Genetic depletion of adhesion molecules or pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization abolishes the potentiating effect of DNMTi. Clinically, the DNMTi-associated cytoskeleton signature stratifies lung cancer patients prognostically. These results support a combinatorial strategy of DNMTis and γδ T cell-based immunotherapy in lung cancer management.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cui, Yuxin</author><author>Li, Zhilei</author><author>Cao, Junxia</author><author>Lane, Jane</author><author>Birkin, Emily</author><author>Dong, Xuefei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The G4 Resolvase DHX36 Possesses a Prognosis Signi fi cance and Exerts Tumour Suppressing Function Through Multiple Causal Regulations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>April</issue><keywords><keyword>3D spheroid</keyword><keyword>3d spheroid</keyword><keyword>DHX36</keyword><keyword>dhx36</keyword><keyword>drug</keyword><keyword>frontiers in oncology</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>lung cancer</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>single-cell culture</keyword><keyword>transcriptomics</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fonc.2021.655757</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The G4 Resolvase DHX36 Possesses a Prognosis Significance and Exerts Tumour Suppressing Function Through Multiple Causal Regulations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.655757</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in both men and women worldwide. The nucleic acid G4 structures have been implicated in the transcriptional programmes of cancer-related genes in some cancers such as lung cancer. However, the role of the dominant G4 resolvase DHX36 in the progression of lung cancer remains unknown. In this study, by bioinformatic analysis of public datasets (TCGA and GEO), we find DHX36 is an independent prognosis indicator in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with subtype dependence. The stable lentiviral knockdown of the DHX36 results in accelerated migration and aggregation of the S-phase subpopulation in lung cancer cells. The reduction of DHX36 level de-sensitises the proliferation response of lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel with cell dependence. The knockdown of this helicase leads to promoted tumour growth, demonstrated by a 3D fluorescence spheroid lung cancer model, and the stimulation of cell colony formation as shown by single-cell cultivation. High throughput proteomic array indicates that DHX36 functions in lung cancer cells through regulating multiple signalling pathways including activation of protein activity, protein autophosphorylation, Fc-receptor signalling pathway, response to peptide hormone and stress-activated protein kinase signalling cascade. A causal transcriptomic analysis suggests that DHX36 is significantly associated with mRNA surveillance, RNA degradation, DNA replication and Myc targets. Therefore, we unveil that DHX36 presents clinical significance and plays a role in tumour suppression in lung cancer, and propose a potentially new concept for an anti-cancer therapy based on helicase-specific targeting.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cui, Yuxin</author><author>Li, Liting</author><author>Li, Zhilei</author><author>Yin, Jie</author><author>Lane, Jane</author><author>Ji, Jiafu</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dual effects of targeting S100A11 on suppressing cellular metastatic properties and sensitizing drug response in gastric cancer</title><secondary-title>Cancer Cell International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Cell International</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>243</issue><keywords><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Clinical significance</keyword><keyword>Drug resistance</keyword><keyword>Gastric cancer</keyword><keyword>Invasion</keyword><keyword>S100A11</keyword><keyword>adhesion</keyword><keyword>clinical significance</keyword><keyword>drug resistance</keyword><keyword>gastric cancer</keyword><keyword>invasion</keyword><keyword>s100a11</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12935-021-01949-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dual effects of targeting S100A11 on suppressing cellular metastatic properties and sensitizing drug response in gastric cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-021-01949-1</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Abstract Background: S100A11 is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. The dysregulated expression of the S100A11 gene has been implicated in tumour metastasis. However, the role of S100A11 protein in tumour cell response to chemotherapeutic drugs has not been characterised. Methods: Transcript levels of S100A11 in gastric cancer were evaluated using an in-house patient cohort. Protein expression of S100A11 in gastric cancer was estimated by immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray. The stable gastric cancer cell lines were established using lentiviral shRNA vectors. The knockdown of S100A11 was validated by qRT-PCR, PCR, and Western blot. The cellular function of S100A11 was estimated by assays of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. The cell cytotoxic assay was performed to investigate the response to chemotherapeutic drugs. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (HCPC) was applied to unveil the dimensional role of S100A11 among all S100 family members in gastric cancer. Results: High expression of S100A11 is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients (p&lt;0.001, HR=1.85) and is an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer. We demonstrate that S100A11 plays its role as a tumour promoter through regulating the MMP activity and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The stable knockdown of S100A11 suppresses the metastatic properties of gastric cancer cells, which include enhancing cell adhesion, but decelerating cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the knockdown of S100A11 gene expression dramatically induces the cellular response of gastric cancer cells to the frst-line chemotherapeutic drugs fuoropyrimidine 5-fuorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin. Conclusion: The present study identifes S100A11 as a tumour promoter in gastric cancer. More importantly, the S100A11-specifc targeting potentially presents dual therapeutic benefts by not only controlling tumour progression but also sensitising chemotherapeutic cytotoxic response.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pape, Thorben</author><author>Idowu, Temitayo O</author><author>Etzrodt, Valerie</author><author>Stahl, Klaus</author><author>Seeliger, Benjamin</author><author>Haller, Hermann</author><author>David, Sascha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modulation of The Permeability-Inducing Factor Angiopoietin-2 Through Bifonazole in Systemic Inflammation</title><secondary-title>Shock</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Shock</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SHK.0000000000001777</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.lww.com/shockjournal/Abstract/9000/Modulation_of_The_Permeability_Inducing_Factor.97272.aspx</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background: Vascular barrier breakdown in sepsis represents a key component of the maladaptive host response to infection and the release of endothelial Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2) is a mechanistic driver of endothelial hyperpermeability. Angpt-2 is associated with morbidity and mortality but a targeted therapeutic approach is not available. We screened for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs that might have off-target effects decreasing Angpt-2 and therefore, ameliorating capillary leakage. Methods: Endothelial cells were isolated from human umbilical veins (HUVECs) and used for in vitro studies at baseline and after stimulation (FDA-library screening, RT-PCR, ELISA, immunocytochemistry, MTT assay). On the functional level, we assessed real-time transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) using an ECIS (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) device. Results: We found that the anti-fungal Bifonazole (BIFO) reduces spontaneous Angpt-2 release in a time- and dose-dependent manner after 8, 12 and 24 h (24 h: veh: 15.6 ± 0.7 vs. BIFO: 8.6 ± 0.8 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, we observed a reduction in its intra-cellular content by 33% (p &lt; 0.001). Stimulation with tumor necrosis factor α induced a strong release of Angpt-2 that could analogously be blocked by additional treatment with BIFO (veh: 1.58 ± 0.2 vs. BIFO: 1.02 ± 0.1, p &lt; 0.0001). Quantification of endothelial permeability by TER revealed that BIFO was sufficient to reduce Thrombin-induced barrier breakdown (veh: 0.82 ± 0.1 vs. BIFO: 1.01 ± 0.02, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The antifungal BIFO reduces both release and biosynthesis of the endothelial-destabilizing factor Angpt-2 in vitro thereby improving vascular barrier function. Additional studies are needed to further investigate the underlying mechanism and to translate these findings to in vivo models.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Brien, Brendan J</author><author>Singer, Harold A</author><author>Adam, Alejandro P</author><author>Ginnan, Roman G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CaMKIIδ is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a JAK/STAT3-dependent manner to promote angiogenesis</title><secondary-title>FASEB J</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB J</full-title></periodical><pages>21437</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.202002755R</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002755r</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Proliferation</label><abstract>Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a ubiquitous serine threonine kinase with established roles in physiological and pathophysiological vascular remodeling. Based on our previous study demonstrating that CaMKIIδ promotes thrombin-induced endothelial permeability and recent reports that CaMKII may contribute to inflammatory remodeling in the heart, we investigated CaMKIIδ-dependent regulation of endothelial function downstream of an interleukin-6 (IL-6)/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis. Upon treatment with IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL-6r), CaMKIIδ expression is significantly induced in HUVEC. Using pharmacological inhibitors of JAK and siRNA targeting STAT3, we demonstrated that activation of STAT3 is sufficient to induce CaMKIIδ expression. Under these conditions, rather than promoting IL-6-induced permeability, we found that CaMKIIδ promotes endothelial cell migration as measured by live cell imaging of scratch wound closure and single-cell motility analysis. In a similar manner, endothelial cell proliferation was attenuated upon knockdown of CaMKIIδ as determined by growth curves, cell cycle analysis, and capacitance of cell-covered electrodes as measured by ECIS. Using inducible endothelial-specific STAT3 knockout mice, we demonstrate that STAT3 signaling promotes developmental angiogenesis in the neonatal mouse retina assessed at postnatal day 6. CaMKIIδ expression in retinal endothelium was attenuated in these animals as measured by qPCR. STAT3's effects on angiogenesis were phenocopied by the endothelial-specific knockout of CaMKIIδ, with significantly reduced vascular outgrowth and number of junctions in the developing P6 retina. For the first time, we demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of CaMKIIδ by STAT3 promotes endothelial motility, proliferation, and in vivo angiogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Fanlu</author><author>Xiao, Yuejun</author><author>Neupane, Sandesh</author><author>Ptak, Signe Helle</author><author>Römer, Ramona</author><author>Xiong, Junyu</author><author>Ohmes, Julia</author><author>Seekamp, Andreas</author><author>Fretté, Xavier</author><author>Alban, Susanne</author><author>Fuchs, Sabine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of Fucoidan Extracts from Different Fucus Species on Adult Stem Cells and Molecular Mediators in In Vitro Models for Bone Formation and Vascularization</title><secondary-title>Marine drugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine drugs</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>bone vascularization</keyword><keyword>fucoidan</keyword><keyword>mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)</keyword><keyword>outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><accession-num>33805470</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/md19040194</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Influence of Fucoidan Extracts from Different Fucus Species on Adult Stem Cells and Molecular Mediators in In Vitro Models for Bone Formation and Vascularization.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fmd19040194</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Barrier Function;Proliferation</label><abstract>Fucoidans, sulfated polysaccharides extracted from brown algae, are marine products with the potential to modulate bone formation and vascularization processes. The bioactivity and safety of fucoidans are highly associated with their chemical structure, which may vary with algae species and extraction method. Thus, in depth evaluation of fucoidan extracts in terms of endotoxin content, cytotoxicity, and their detailed molecular biological impact on the individual cell types in bone is needed. In this study, we characterized fucoidan extracts from three different Fucus species including Fucus vesiculosus (Fv), Fucus serratus (Fs), and Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens (Fe) for their chemical features, endotoxin content, cytotoxicity, and bioactive effects on human outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as in vitro models for bone function and vascularization. Extracts contained mainly high molecular weight (HMW) fucoidans and were free of endotoxins that may cause inflammation or influence vascularization. OEC tolerated fucoidan concentrations up to 200 µg/mL, and no indication of cytotoxicity was observed. The inflammatory response, however, investigated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and endothelial barrier assessed by impedance measurement differed for the individual extracts. MSC in comparison with endothelial cells were more sensitive to fucoidans and showed partly reduced metabolic activity and proliferation at higher doses of fucoidans. Further results for MSC indicated impaired osteogenic functions in alkaline phosphatase and calcification assays. All tested extracts consistently lowered important molecular mediators involved in angiogenesis, such a VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), ANG-1 (angiopoietin 1), and ANG-2 (angiopoietin 2), as indicated by RT-PCR and ELISA. This was associated with antiangiogenic effects at the functional level using selected extracts in co-culture models to mimic bone vascularization processes during bone regeneration or osteosarcoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagner, Grzegorz Karol</author><author>Jaszek, Magdalena</author><author>Staniec, Bernard</author><author>Prendecka, Monika</author><author>Pigo, Dominika</author><author>Belcarz, Anna</author><author>Stefaniuk, Dawid</author><author>Matuszewska, Anna</author><author>Tudruj, Ewa Pietrykowska</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lasius fuliginosus Nest Carton as a Source of New Promising Bioactive Extracts with Chemopreventive Potential</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4392</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms22094392</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lasius fuliginosus Nest Carton as a Source of New Promising Bioactive Extracts with Chemopreventive Potential.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094392</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Proliferation</label><abstract>Six new water extracts (E1–E6) were obtained from nest carton produced by jet black ants Lasius fuliginosus and tested for their biochemical and bioactive properties, including antioxidative and anticancer effects. The present study demonstrated significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the content of individual biochemical constituents, as well as bioactive properties between the investigated samples. All tested extracts demonstrated antioxidant properties (determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) methods), and the highest antioxidative potential was recorded in extracts E1 and E2 (188.96 and 313.67 μg/mL of ascorbic acid equivalent for ABTS and 176.42 and 202.66 μg/mL for DPPH reagent). Furthermore the six extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity towards human melanoma cells of the A-375 CRL-1619 line in a dose-dependent manner. The most interesting chemopreventive activity was exhibited by extract E2, which inhibited the proliferation of A-375 cells to the greatest extent, while having a minimal effect on Vero cells. The effect on cancer cells has been confirmed using the Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) technique. Significant impedance changes have been detected in A-375 and Vero cells following the administration of extract E2. The obtained results are really promising and constitute the basis for further research on the nest carton of jet black ant.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Qin</author><author>Zheng, Mei</author><author>Betancourt, Cristian E</author><author>Liu, Lifeng</author><author>Sitikov, Albert</author><author>Sladojevic, Nikola</author><author>Zhao, Qiong</author><author>Zhang, John H</author><author>Liao, James K</author><author>Wu, Rongxue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increase in Blood-Brain Barrier ( BBB ) Permeability Is Regulated by MMP3 via the ERK Signaling Pathway</title><secondary-title>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</full-title></periodical><volume>2021</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2021/6655122</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Increase in Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeability Is Regulated by MMP3 via the ERK Signaling Pathway.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2021%2F6655122</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Background The blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulates the exchange of molecules between the brain and peripheral blood and is composed primarily of microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), which form the lining of cerebral blood vessels and are linked via tight junctions (TJs). The BBB is regulated by components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) remodels the ECM's basal lamina, which forms part of the BBB. Oxidative stress is implicated in activation of MMPs and impaired BBB. Thus, we investigated whether MMP3 modulates BBB permeability. Methods Experiments included in vivo assessments of isoflurane anesthesia and dye extravasation from brain in wild-type (WT) and MMP3-deficient (MMP3-KO) mice, as well as in vitro assessments of the integrity of monolayers of WT and MMP3-KO BMVECs and the expression of junction proteins. Results Compared to WT mice, measurements of isoflurane usage and anesthesia induction time were higher in MMP3-KO mice and lower in WT that had been treated with MMP3 (WT+MMP3), while anesthesia emergence times were shorter in MMP3-KO mice and longer in WT+MMP3 mice than in WT. Extravasation of systemically administered dyes was also lower in MMP3-KO mouse brains and higher in WT+MMP3 mouse brains, than in the brains of WT mice. The results from both TEER and Transwell assays indicated that MMP3 deficiency (or inhibition) increased, while MMP3 upregulation reduced barrier integrity in either BMVEC or the coculture. MMP3 deficiency also increased the abundance of TJs and VE-cadherin proteins in BMVECs, and the protein abundance declined when MMP3 activity was upregulated in BMVECs, but not when the cells were treated with an inhibitor of extracellular signal related-kinase (ERK). Conclusion MMP3 increases BBB permeability following the administration of isoflurane by upregulating the ERK signaling pathway, which subsequently reduces TJ and VE-cadherin proteins in BMVECs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Chang</author><author>Jiang, Wen G.</author><author>Zhang, Lijian</author><author>Hargest, Rachel</author><author>Martin, Tracey A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sipa1 is a modulator of hgf/met induced tumour metastasis via the regulation of tight junction‐based cell to cell barrier function</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)</keyword><keyword>Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</keyword><keyword>N‐ methyl‐N′‐nitroso‐guanidine human osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Signal induced proliferation associated 1 (SIPA1)</keyword><keyword>Tight junction (TJ)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers13071747</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SIPA1 Is a Modulator of HGF MET Induced Tumour Metastasis via the Regulation of Tight Junction Based Cell to Cell Barrier Function.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. SIPA1 is a mitogen induced GTPase activating protein (GAP) and may hamper cell cycle progression. SIPA1 has been shown to be involved in MET signaling and may contribute to tight junction (TJ) function and cancer metas-tasis. Methods: Human lung tumour cohorts were analyzed. In vitro cell function assays were performed after knock down of SIPA1 in lung cancer cells with/without treatment. Quantitative poly-merase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were performed to analyze expression of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), MET, and their downstream markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IFC) staining were performed. Results: Higher expression of SIPA1 in lung tumours was associated with a poorer prognosis. Knockdown of SIPA1 decreased invasiveness and proliferation of in vitro cell lines, and the SIPA1 knockdown cells demonstrated leaky barriers. Knockdown of SIPA1 decreased tight junction‐based barrier function by downregulating MET at the protein but not the transcript level, through silencing of Grb2, SOCS, and PKCμ (Protein kinase Cμ), reducing the internalization and recycling of MET. Elevated levels of SIPA1 protein are correlated with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), especially HGF/MET and TJs. The regulation of HGF on barrier function and invasion required the presence of SIPA1. Conclusions: SIPA1 plays an essential role in lung tumourigenesis and metastasis. SIPA1 may be a diagnostic and prognostic predictive biomarker. SIPA1 may also be a potential therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with aberrant MET expression and drug resistance.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amado-Azevedo, Joana</author><author>Stalborch, Anne-Marieke D. van</author><author>Valent, Erik T.</author><author>Nawaz, Kalim</author><author>Bezu, Jan van</author><author>Eringa, Etto C.</author><author>Hoevenaars, Femke P.M.</author><author>Cuyper, Iris M.

We identified the kinase Arg/Abl2 as a mediator of endothelial barrier disruption, but the role of Arg in endothelial monolayer regulation and its relevance in vivo remain poorly understood. Here we show that depletion of Arg in endothelial cells results in the activation of both RhoA and Rac1, increased cell spreading and elongation, redistribution of integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesions to the cell periphery, and improved adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We further show that Arg is activated in the endothelium during inflammation, both in murine lungs exposed to barrier-disruptive agents, and in pulmonary microvessels of septic patients. Importantly, Arg-depleted endothelial cells were less sensitive to barrier-disruptive agents. Despite the formation of F-actin stress fibers and myosin light chain phosphorylation, Arg depletion diminished adherens junction disruption and intercellular gap formation, by reducing the disassembly of cell-matrix adhesions and cell retraction. In vivo, genetic deletion of Arg diminished vascular leak in the skin and lungs, in the presence of a normal immune response. Together, our data indicate that Arg is a central and non-redundant regulator of endothelial barrier integrity, which contributes to cell retraction and gap formation by increasing the dynamics of adherens junctions and cell-matrix adhesions in a Rho GTPase-dependent fashion. Therapeutic inhibition of Arg may provide a suitable strategy for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions characterized by vascular leak.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hankir, Mohammed K</author><author>Seyfried, Florian</author><author>Schellinger, Isabel N</author><author>Schlegel, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Leaky Gut as a Potential Culprit for the Paradoxical Dysglycemic Response to Gastric Bypass-Associated Ileal Microbiota</title><secondary-title>Metabolites</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Metabolites</full-title></periodical><pages>153</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>intestinal epithelial barrier</keyword><keyword>intestinal microbiota</keyword><keyword>roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery</keyword><keyword>systemic endotoxemia</keyword><keyword>type 2 diabetes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fmetabo11030153</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Leaky Gut as a Potential Culprit for the Paradoxical Dysglycemic Response to Gastric Bypass-Associated Ileal Microbiota.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fmetabo11030153</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Altered host-intestinal microbiota interactions are increasingly implicated in the metabolic benefits of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery.

Consistently, application of ileal content from RYGB-treated compared with sham-operated rats onto Caco-2 cell monolayers compromised barrier function and decreased expression of the barrier-stabilizing proteins claudin-4 and desmoglein-2.

It has been demonstrated that actomyosin rearrangement during macrophage differentiation is dependent on Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Myosin phosphatase (MP) target subunit-1 (MYPT1) is one of the major cellular substrates of ROCK, and MP is often a counter enzyme of ROCK; therefore, MP may also control macrophage differentiation. Changes in MP activity and the effects of MP activation were studied on PMA or l,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of monocytic THP-1 cells. During macrophage differentiation, phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 and Thr853 increased significantly, resulting in inhibition of MP. The ROCK inhibitor H1152 and the MP activator epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) attenuated MYPT1 phosphorylation and concomitantly decreased the extent of phosphorylation of 20 kDa myosin light chain. H1152 and EGCG pretreatment also suppressed the expression of CD11b and weakened the PMA-induced adherence of the cells. Our results indicate that MP activation/inhibition contributes to the efficacy of monocyte to macrophage differentiation, and this enzyme may be a target for pharmacological interventions in the control of disease states that are affected by excessive macrophage differentiation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laradji, Amine M.</author><author>Kolesnikov, Alexander V.</author><author>Karakoçak, Bedia B.</author><author>Kefalov, Vladimir J.</author><author>Ravi, Nathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Redox-Responsive Hyaluronic Acid-Based Nanogels for the Topical Delivery of the Visual Chromophore to Retinal Photoreceptors</title><secondary-title>ACS Omega</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS Omega</full-title></periodical><pages>6172-6184</pages><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acsomega.0c05535</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Redox-Responsive Hyaluronic Acid-Based Nanogels for the Topical Delivery of the Visual Chromophore to Retinal Photoreceptors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsomega.0c05535</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Delivering therapeutics to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to various anatomical and physical barriers. While significant improvements have been realized by introducing direct injections to diseased sites, these approaches come with potential side effects that can range from simple inflammation to severe retinal damage. The topical instillation of drugs remains a safer and preferred alternative for patients' compliance. Here, we report the synthesis of penetratin-complexed, redox-responsive hyaluronic acid-based nanogels for the triggered release and delivery of therapeutics to the posterior part of the eye via topical application. The synthesized nanogels were shown to release their load only when exposed to a reducing environment, similar to the cytoplasm. As a model drug, visual chromophore analog, 9-cis-retinal, was loaded into nanogels and efficiently delivered to the mouse retina's photoreceptors when applied topically. Electroretinogram measurements showed a partial recovery of photoreceptor function in all treated eyes versus untreated controls. To the best of our knowledge, this report constitutes the first attempt to use a topically applied triggered-release drug delivery system to target the pigmented layer of the retina, in addition to the first attempt to deliver the visual chromophore topically.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Tyler M</author><author>Houghton, Sean</author><author>Magdeldin, Tarig</author><author>Gabriel, José</author><author>Durán, Barcia</author><author>Minotti, Andrew P</author><author>Snead, Amanda</author><author>Sproul, Andrew</author><author>Nguyen, Duc-huy T</author><author>Xiang, Jenny</author><author>Fine, Howard A</author><author>Rosenwaks, Zev</author><author>Studer, Lorenz</author><author>Rafii, Shahin</author><author>Agalliu, Dritan</author><author>Redmond, David</author><author>Lis, Raphael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pluripotent stem cell-derived epithelium misidentified as brain microvascular endothelium requires ETS factors to acquire vascular fate</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><volume>118</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>blood–brain barrier</keyword><keyword>cellular identity</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>induced pluripotent</keyword><keyword>single-cell RNA sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.2016950118</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pluripotent stem cell-derived epithelium misidentified as brain microvascular endothelium requires ETS factors to acquire vascular fate.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.2016950118</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Cells derived from pluripotent sources in vitro must resemble those found in vivo as closely as possible at both transcriptional and functional levels in order to be a useful tool for studying diseases and developing therapeutics. Recently, differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) with blood–brain barrier (BBB)-like properties has been reported. These cells have since been used as a robust in vitro BBB model for drug delivery and mechanistic understanding of neurological diseases. However, the precise cellular identity of these induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) has not been well described. Employing a comprehensive transcriptomic metaanalysis of previously published hPSC-derived cells validated by physiological assays, we demonstrate that iBMECs lack functional attributes of ECs since they are deficient in vascular lineage genes while expressing clusters of genes related to the neuroectodermal epithelial lineage (Epi-iBMEC). Overexpression of key endothelial ETS transcription factors (ETV2, ERG, and FLI1) reprograms Epi-iBMECs into authentic endothelial cells that are congruent with bona fide endothelium at both transcriptomic as well as some functional levels. This approach could eventually be used to develop a robust human BBB model in vitro that resembles the human brain EC in vivo for functional studies and drug discovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khalyfa, Abdelnaby</author><author>Ericsson, Aaron</author><author>Qiao, Zhuanghong</author><author>Almendros, Isaac</author><author>Farré, Ramon</author><author>Gozal, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulating exosomes and gut microbiome induced insulin resistance in mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia: Effects of physical activity</title><secondary-title>EBioMedicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EBioMedicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>64</volume><keywords><keyword>Exercise</keyword><keyword>Exosomes</keyword><keyword>Extracellular vesicles</keyword><keyword>Gut microbiome</keyword><keyword>Intermittent hypoxia</keyword><keyword>Metabolome</keyword><keyword>OSA</keyword><keyword>Physical activity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103208</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Circulating exosomes and gut microbiome induced insulin resistance in mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia Effects of physical activity.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Gut microbiota (GM) contribute to obesity and insulin resistance (IR).

Fecal microbiota transfers (FMT) were performed in naïve mice (n = 5/group), followed by fecal 16S rRNA sequencing, and systemic IR and exosome-induced effects on adipocyte insulin sensitivity were evaluated. Findings: Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) ordinates revealed B-diversity among IH and FMT recipients that accounted for 64% principal component 1 (PC1) and 12.5% (PC2) of total variance. Dominant microbiota families and genera in IH-exposed and FMT-treated were preserved, and IH-exposed GM and IH-FMT induced increased gut permeability. Plasma exosomes from IH-exposed and IH-FMT mice decreased pAKT/AKT responses to exogenous insulin in adipocytes vs. IH+PA or RA FMT-treated mice (p = 0.001). Interpretation: IH exposures mimicking OSA induce changes in GM, increase gut permeability, and alter plasma exosome cargo, the latter inducing adipocyte dysfunction (increased IR). Furthermore, these alterations improved with PA. Thus, IH leads to perturbations of a singular GM-circulating exosome pathway that disrupts adipocyte homeostasis resulting in metabolic dysfunction, as reflected by IR.

The underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) contributes to IEB maturation and may therefore be the predominant mediator of this process by EGCs. Using GFAPcre x Ai14floxed mice to isolate EGCs by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we confirmed that they synthesize GDNF in vivo as well as in primary cultures demonstrating that EGCs are a rich source of GDNF in vivo and in vitro. Co-culture of EGCs with Caco2 cells resulted in IEB maturation which was abrogated when GDNF was either depleted from EGC supernatants, or knocked down in EGCs or when the GDNF receptor RET was blocked. Further, TNFα-induced loss of IEB function in Caco2 cells and in organoids was attenuated by EGC supernatants or by recombinant GDNF. These barrier-protective effects were blunted when using supernatants from GDNF-deficient EGCs or by RET receptor blockade. Together, our data show that EGCs produce GDNF to maintain IEB function in vitro through the RET receptor.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buzhdygan, Tetyana P</author><author>Rodrigues, Cassidy R</author><author>Mcgary, Hannah M</author><author>Khan, Jana A</author><author>Andrews, Allison M</author><author>Rawls, Scott M</author><author>Ramirez, Servio H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The psychoactive drug of abuse mephedrone differentially disrupts blood- brain barrier properties</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>63</issue><keywords><keyword>BBB</keyword><keyword>Cathinones</keyword><keyword>Mephedrone</keyword><keyword>Neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>Substance abuse</keyword><keyword>bbb</keyword><keyword>cathinones</keyword><keyword>correspondence</keyword><keyword>edu</keyword><keyword>mephedrone</keyword><keyword>neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>servio</keyword><keyword>substance abuse</keyword><keyword>temple</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Journal of Neuroinflammation</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The psychoactive drug of abuse mephedrone differentially disrupts blood-brain barrier properties.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12974-021-02116-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Background Synthetic cathinones are a category of psychostimulants belonging to the growing number of designer drugs also known as “Novel Psychoactive Substances” (NPS). In recent years, NPS have gained popularity in the recreational drug market due to their amphetamine-like stimulant effects, low cost, ease of availability, and lack of detection by conventional toxicology screening. All these factors have led to an increase in NPS substance abuse among the young adults, followed by spike of overdose-related fatalities and adverse effects, severe neurotoxicity, and cerebral vascular complications. Much remains unknown about how synthetic cathinones negatively affect the CNS and the status of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Methods We used in vitro models of the BBB and primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC) to investigate the effects of the synthetic cathinone, 4-methyl methcathinone (mephedrone), on BBB properties. Results We showed that mephedrone exposure resulted in the loss of barrier properties and endothelial dysfunction of primary hBMVEC. Increased permeability and decreased transendothelial electrical resistance of the endothelial barrier were attributed to changes in key proteins involved in the tight junction formation. Elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases, angiogenic growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines can be explained by TLR-4-dependent activation of NF-κB signaling. Conclusions In this first characterization of the effects of a synthetic cathinone on human brain endothelial cells, it appears clear that mephedrone-induced damage of the BBB is not limited by the disruption of the barrier properties but also include endothelial activation and inflammation. This may especially be important in comorbid situations of mephedrone abuse and HIV-1 infections. In this context, mephedrone could negatively affect HIV-1 neuroinvasion and NeuroAIDS progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Etzrodt, Valerie</author><author>Idowu, Temitayo O</author><author>Schenk, Heiko</author><author>Seeliger, Benjamin</author><author>Prasse, Antje</author><author>Thamm, Kristina</author><author>Pape, Thorben</author><author>Deile, Janina Müller</author><author>Meurs, Matijs Van</author><author>Thum, Thomas</author><author>Garg, Ankita</author><author>Geffers, Robert</author><author>Stahl, Klaus</author><author>Parikh, Samir M</author><author>Haller, Hermann</author><author>David, Sascha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of endothelial microRNA 155 on capillary leakage in systemic inflammation</title><secondary-title>Critical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Care</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>76</issue><keywords><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>Respiratory distress syndrome</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>Tight junctions</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>micrornas</keyword><keyword>respiratory distress syndrome</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>tight junctions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><isbn>1305402103</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13054-021-03500-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Role of endothelial microRNA 155 on capillary leakage in systemic inflammation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03500-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background Capillary leakage is a key contributor to the pathological host response to infections. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and the role of microRNAs (MIR) has not been investigated in detail. We hypothesized that specific MIRs might be regulated directly in the endothelium thereby contributing to vascular leakage. Methods SmallRNA sequencing of endotoxemic murine pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) was done to detect regulated vascular MIRs. In vivo models: transgenic zebrafish (flk1:mCherry/l-fabp:eGFP-DPB), knockout/wildtype mouse (B6.Cg-Mir155tm1.1Rsky/J); disease models: LPS 17.5 mg/kgBW and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); in vitro models: stimulated human umbilical vein EC (HUVECs), transendothelial electrical resistance. Results Endothelial MIR155 was identified as a promising candidate in endotoxemic murine pulmonary ECs (25 × upregulation). Experimental overexpression in a transgenic zebrafish line and in HUVECs was sufficient to induce spontaneous vascular leakage. To the contrary, genetic MIR155 reduction protects against permeability both in vitro and in endotoxemia in vivo in MIR155 heterozygote knockout mice thereby improving survival by 40%. A tight junction protein, Claudin-1, was down-regulated both in endotoxemia and by experimental MIR155 overexpression. Translationally, MIR155 was detectable at high levels in bronchoalveolar fluid of patients with ARDS compared to healthy human subjects. Conclusions We found that MIR155 is upregulated in the endothelium in mouse and men as part of a systemic inflammatory response and might contribute to the pathophysiology of vascular leakage in a Claudin-1-dependent manner. Future studies have to clarify whether MIR155 could be a potential therapeutic target.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Joffre, Jérémie</author><author>Lloyd, Elliot</author><author>Wong, Erika</author><author>Chung-Yeh, Che</author><author>Nguyen, Nina</author><author>Xu, Fenguyn</author><author>Legrand, Matthieu</author><author>Hellman, Judith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Catecholaminergic Vasopressors Reduce Toll-Like Receptor Agonist-Induced Microvascular Endothelial Cell Permeability But Not Cytokine Production</title><secondary-title>Critical Care Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Care Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>315-326</pages><volume>Publish Ah</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><isbn>0000000000</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/ccm.0000000000004854</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Catecholaminergic Vasopressors Reduce Toll-Like Receptor Agonist-Induced Microvascular Endothelial Cell Permeability But Not Cytokine Production.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FCCM.0000000000004854</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Catecholaminergic vasopressors are the cornerstone of circulatory shock management. Nevertheless, catecholamines have problematic side effects, arousing a growing interest in noncatecholaminergic agents such as vasopressin or angiotensin-II. However, their respective effects on sepsis-associated microvascular endothelial dysfunction such as permeability or inflammation remain elusive. We investigated the role of catecholamines and other vasopressors on Toll-like receptor agonists-induced microvascular endothelial permeability and inflammation. SETTING: University research laboratory/cell research. SUBJECTS: Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from multiple donors. INTERVENTION: Confluent monolayers of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were treated with Toll-like receptor agonists (lipopolysaccharide, Poly[I:C], or tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine) in the presence or absence of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin-II. Permeability was inferred from transendothelial resistance, measured using electrical cell impedance sensing, where decreased transendothelial resistance is consistent with increased permeability. Cell-cell junction molecule expression was assessed via immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. We quantified cytokines in supernatants of Toll-like receptor agonist-treated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Epinephrine and norepinephrine both ameliorate lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, or tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine–induced reductions in transendothelial resistance, a surrogate for endothelial permeability. In contrast, the noncatecholaminergic agents, vasopressin, and angiotensin-II did not affect Toll-like receptor agonists-induced reductions in transendothelial resistance. β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonists reduced the effects of the catecholamines on transendothelial resistance, whereas α-adrenergic receptor antagonists did not. We observed that epinephrine and norepinephrine induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and normalized the membrane expression of proteins involved with adherens-junctions (vascular endothelial-cadherin) and tight-junctions (zona occludens-1). Despite having a substantial effect on endothelial permeability, epinephrine and norepinephrine did not affect human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell survival or production of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL-2) induced by Toll-like receptor agonists, suggesting that these functions are regulated separately from permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that treatment with epinephrine or norepinephrine strongly reduces endothelial permeability induced by agonists of multiple Toll-like receptors (Toll-like receptor-2, Toll-like receptor-3, Toll-like receptor-4) in vitro. Our studies suggest that both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors mediate the stabilizing effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author><author>Hussein, Khaled</author><author>Wang, Fang</author><author>Wan, Ming</author><author>Elmasry, Khaled</author><author>Elsherbiny, Nehal</author><author>Saleh, Heba</author><author>Yu, Paul B.</author><author>Tawfik, Amany</author><author>Ibrahim, Ahmed S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Induces Non-Canonical Inflammatory and Oxidative Pathways in Human Retinal Endothelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2020.568795</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Induces Non-Canonical Inflammatory and Oxidative Pathways in Human Retinal Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.568795</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>The mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy (DR), are not yet fully understood. We previously demonstrated an upregulation of retinal bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) in experimental diabetes and in retinas of diabetic human subjects. The purpose of current study was to investigate the role of non-canonical inflammatory pathway in BMP2-induced retinal endothelial cell (REC) barrier dysfunction. For this purpose, we used RT-PCR and western blotting to evaluate the levels of BMP2 signaling components (BMP2, BMP4, BMP receptors), VEGF, phosphorylated p38 MAPK and NFκB, and oxidative stress markers in cultured human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) subjected to BMP2 (50ng/ml) for up to 24 h. Also, effect of high glucose (HG, 30mM D-glucose) on the expression of BMP2 and its downstream genes was examined in HRECs. H2-DCF is a fluorogenic dye that measures the levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was used to measure the pro-oxidative effect of BMP2. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of inhibiting p38 and VEGF signaling on BMP2-induced HRECs barrier dysfunction by measuring the trans-endothelial cell electrical resistance (TER) using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). We also tested the effect of HG on the integrity of HRECs barrier in the presence or absence of inhibitors of BMP2 signaling. Our data reveals that BMP2 and high glucose upregulates BMP components of the BMP signaling pathway (SMAD effectors, BMP receptors, and TGFβ ligand itself) and induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and NFκB with nuclear translocation of NFκB. Inhibition of p38 or NFκB attenuated BMP2-induced VEGF expression and barrier dysfunction in HRECs. Also, inhibition of VEGFR2 attenuated BMP2-induced barrier dysfunction. Moreover, BMP2 induces generation of ROS and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activity in HRECs. Finally, HG upregulated BMP2 and its downstream genes (SMAD, BMP4, ALKs, and TGF-β) in HRECs and BMP2 inhibitors attenuated HG-induced HRECs barrier dysfunction. Our results suggest that in addition to the regular canonical SMAD signaling BMP2 induces non-canonical inflammatory pathway in HRECs via activation of p38/NFκB pathway that causes the upregulation of VEGF and the disruption of HRECs. Inhibition of BMP2 signaling is a potential therapeutic intervention to preserve endothelial cell barrier function in DR.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Zhi</author><author>Dixon, Jendayi</author><author>Guo, Xiaofang</author><author>Deal, Benjamin</author><author>Liao, Qianjin</author><author>Zhou, Yujuan</author><author>Cheng, Feng</author><author>Allen-Gipson, Diane S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Co-inhibition of CD73 and ADORA2B Improves Long-Term Cigarette Smoke Induced Lung Injury</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>CD73</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>adenosine</keyword><keyword>cigarette smoke</keyword><keyword>lung</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphys.2021.614330</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Co-inhibition of CD73 and ADORA2B Improves Long-Term Cigarette Smoke Induced Lung Injury.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphys.2021.614330</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Proliferation;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Adenosine (ADO) involvement in lung injury depends on the activation of its receptors. The ADO A 2A receptor (ADORA2A) and A 2B receptor (ADORA2B) are best described to have both tissue-protective and tissue-destructive processes. However, no approach has been effective in delineating the mechanism(s) involved with ADO shifting from its tissue-protective to tissue-destructive properties in chronic airway injury. Using cigarette smoke (CS) as our model of injury, we chronically exposed Nuli-1 cells to 5% CS extract (CSE) for 3 years establishing a long-term CSE exposure model (LTC). We found significant morphological changes, decreased proliferation, and migration resulting in impaired airway wound closure in LTC. Further investigations showed that long-term CSE exposure upregulates CD73 and ADORA2B expression, increases ADO production, inhibits PKC alpha activity and p-ERK signaling pathway. Knocking down ADORA2B and/or CD73 in LTC activates PKC alpha and increases p-ERK signaling. Knocking down both showed better improvement in wound repair than either alone. In vivo experiments also showed that double knockout CD73 and ADORA2B remarkably improved CS-induced lung injury by activating PKC alpha, reducing the inflammatory cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the production of inflammatory mediator IL-6, inhibiting the fibrosis-like lesions and decreasing collagen deposition surrounding bronchioles. Collectively, long-term CSE exposure upregulates CD73 expression and increases ADO production, which promotes low affinity ADORA2B activation and subsequent diminution of PKC alpha activity and ERK signaling pathway, and inhibition of airway wound repair. Moreover, the data suggesting ADORA2B and CD73 as potential therapeutic targets may be more efficacious in improving chronic CS lung diseases and impaired wound repair.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strzepa, Anna</author><author>Gurski, Cody J.</author><author>Dittel, Landon J.</author><author>Szczepanik, Marian</author><author>Pritchard, Kirkwood A.</author><author>Dittel, Bonnie N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neutrophil-Derived Myeloperoxidase Facilitates Both the Induction and Elicitation Phases of Contact Hypersensitivity</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>contact hypersensitivity</keyword><keyword>frontiers in immunology</keyword><keyword>frontiersin</keyword><keyword>interleukin 1 b</keyword><keyword>myeloperoxidase</keyword><keyword>neutrophil</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>vascular permeability</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2020.608871</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Neutrophil-Derived Myeloperoxidase Facilitates Both the Induction and Elicitation Phases of Contact Hypersensitivity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.608871</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Invasion</label><abstract>Background Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a common skin disorder affecting an estimated 15-20% of the general population. The mouse model of ACD is contact hypersensitivity (CHS), which consists of two phases: induction and elicitation. Although neutrophils are required for both CHS disease phases their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Neutrophils release myeloperoxidase (MPO) that through oxidation of biomolecules leads to cellular damage. Objectives This study investigated mechanisms whereby MPO contributes to CHS pathogenesis. Methods CHS was induced in mice using oxazolone (OX) as the initiating hapten applied to the skin. After 7 days, CHS was elicited by application of OX to the ear and disease severity was measured by ear thickness and vascular permeability in the ear. The role of MPO in the two phases of CHS was determined utilizing MPO-deficient mice and a specific MPO inhibitor. Results During the CHS induction phase MPO-deficiency lead to a reduction in IL-1β production in the skin and a subsequent reduction in migratory dendritic cells (DC) and effector T cells in the draining lymph node. During the elicitation phase, inhibition of MPO significantly reduced both ear swelling and vascular permeability. Conclusion MPO plays dual roles in CHS pathogenesis. In the initiation phase MPO promotes IL-1β production in the skin and activation of migratory DC that promote effector T cell priming. In the elicitation phase MPO drives vascular permeability contributing to inflammation. These results indicate that MPO it could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ACD in humans.

However, techniques used to study gene function frequently exceed the proliferative potential of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) isolated from patients. Increased expression of the polycomb group protein BMI-1 extends the lifespan of HBECs while maintaining cell context plasticity. Herein we aimed to assess how BMI-1 expression impacted cellular functions and global mRNA expression. HBECs from six donors were transduced with lentivirus containing BMI-1 and cells were characterised, including by RNA sequencing and impedance measurement. BMI-1-expressing HBECs (B-HBECs) have a proliferative advantage and show comparable in vitro properties to low passage primary HBECs, including cell attachment/spreading and barrier formation. The B-HBEC mRNA signature was modestly different to HBECs, with only 293 genes differentially expressed (5% false discovery rate). Genes linked to epithelial mesenchymal transition and cell cycle were enriched in B-HBECs. We investigated the expression of genes implicated in asthma from genetic and expression studies and found that 97.6% of genes remained unaltered. We have shown that increased BMI-1 expression in HBECs delays lung epithelial cell senescence by promoting cell cycle progression and highlighted the flexible utility for B-HBECs as an important platform for studying airway epithelial mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuželová, Kateřina</author><author>Obr, Adam</author><author>Röselová, Pavla</author><author>Grebeňová, Dana</author><author>Otevřelová, Petra</author><author>Brodská, Barbora</author><author>Holoubek, Aleš</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Group I p21-activated kinases in leukemia cell adhesion to fibronectin</title><secondary-title>Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration</full-title></periodical><pages>18-36</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AML</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>IRM</keyword><keyword>PAK</keyword><keyword>acute myeloid leukemia</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19336918.2021.1872760</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Group I p21-activated kinases in leukemia cell adhesion to fibronectin.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1080/19336918.2021.1872760</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment</label><abstract>P21-activated kinases (PAK) regulate processes associated with cytoskeleton dynamics.

Here we report that mice with a brain EC-specific deletion of Pdcd10 (Pdcd10BECKO) survive up to 6-12 months and develop bona fide CCM lesions in all regions of brain, allowing us to visualize the vascular dynamics of CCM lesions using transcranial two-photon microscopy. This approach reveals that CCMs initiate from protrusion at the level of capillary and post-capillary venules with gradual dissociation of pericytes. Microvascular beds in lesions are hyper-permeable, and these disorganized structures present endomucin-positive ECs and α-smooth muscle actin-positive pericytes. Caveolae in the endothelium of Pdcd10BECKO lesions are drastically increased, enhancing Tie2 signaling in Ccm3-deficient ECs. Moreover, genetic deletion of caveolin-1 or pharmacological blockade of Tie2 signaling effectively normalizes microvascular structure and barrier function with attenuated EC-pericyte disassociation and CCM lesion formation in Pdcd10BECKO mice. Our study establishes a chronic CCM model and uncovers a mechanism by which CCM3 mutation-induced caveolae-Tie2 signaling contributes to CCM pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pham, Tan Phát</author><author>Bink, Diewertje I.</author><author>Stanicek, Laura</author><author>van Bergen, Anke</author><author>van Leeuwen, Esmee</author><author>Tran, Yvonne</author><author>Matic, Ljubica</author><author>Hedin, Ulf</author><author>Wittig, Ilka</author><author>Dimmeler, Stefanie</author><author>Boon, Reinier A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long Non-coding RNA Aerrie Controls DNA Damage Repair via YBX1 to Maintain Endothelial Cell Function</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA damage</keyword><keyword>LncRNA – long non-coding RNA</keyword><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>dna damage</keyword><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>lncrna</keyword><keyword>long non-coding rna</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcell.2020.619079</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Long Non-coding RNA Aerrie Controls DNA Damage Repair via YBX1 to Maintain Endothelial Cell Function.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffcell.2020.619079</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Aging is accompanied by many physiological changes. These changes can progressively lead to many types of cardiovascular diseases. During this process blood vessels lose their ability to maintain vascular homeostasis, ultimately resulting in hypertension, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Increase in DNA damage is one of the hallmarks of aging and can be repaired by the DNA signaling and repair system. In our study we show that long non-coding RNA Aerrie (linc01013) contributes to the DNA signaling and repair mechanism. Silencing of Aerrie in endothelial cells impairs angiogenesis, migration, and barrier function. Aerrie associates with YBX1 and together they act as important factors in DNA damage signaling and repair. This study identifies Aerrie as a novel factor in genomic stability and as a binding partner of YBX1 in responding to DNA damage.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Li, Liang</author><author>Huo, Dong</author><author>Zhi, Shuli</author><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Zhang, Tao</author><author>Dai, Menghong</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Astrocyte-Derived TGFβ1 Facilitates Blood–Brain Barrier Function via Non-Canonical Hedgehog Signaling in Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Brain Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>77</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/brainsci11010077</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Astrocyte-Derived TGFβ1 Facilitates Blood–Brain Barrier Function via Non-Canonical Hedgehog Signaling in Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbrainsci11010077</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>The blood–brain barrier is a specialized structure in mammals, separating the brain from the bloodstream and maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system. The barrier is composed of various types of cells, and the communication between these cells is critical to blood–brain barrier (BBB) function. Here, we demonstrate the astrocyte-derived TGFβ1-mediated intercellular communication between astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). By using an in vitro co-culture model, we observed that the astrocyte-derived TGFβ1 enhanced the tight junction protein ZO-1 expression in BMECs and the endothelial barrier function via a non-canonical hedgehog signaling. Gli2, the core transcriptional factor of the hedgehog pathway, was demonstrated to modulate ZO-1 expression directly. By the dual-luciferase reporter system and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we further identified the exact sites on Smad2/3 that bound to the gli2 promotor and on Gli2 that bound to the zo-1 promotor. Our work highlighted the TGFβ1-mediated intercellular communication of astrocytes with BMECs in BBB, which shall extend current knowledge on the BBB homeostasis physiologically, and more importantly suggests TGFβ1 as a potential effector for future prevention and amelioration of BBB dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Leon, Sorel E.</author><author>Cleuren, Lana</author><author>Oo, Zay Yar</author><author>Stoddart, Paul R.</author><author>McArthur, Sally L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extending In-Plane Impedance Measurements from 2D to 3D Cultures: Design Considerations</title><secondary-title>Bioengineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioengineering</full-title></periodical><pages>11</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>3d cell culture</keyword><keyword>cell proliferation</keyword><keyword>electrical impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>in situ monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bioengineering8010011</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Extending In-Plane Impedance Measurements from 2D to 3D Cultures Design Considerations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fbioengineering8010011</url></web-urls></urls><label>Theory</label><abstract>Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have recently emerged as tools for biologically modelling the human body. As 3D models make their way into laboratories there is a need to develop characterisation techniques that are sensitive enough to monitor the cells in real time and without the need for chemical labels. Impedance spectroscopy has been shown to address both of these challenges, but there has been little research into the full impedance spectrum and how the different components of the system affect the impedance signal. Here we investigate the impedance of human fibroblast cells in 2D and 3D collagen gel cultures across a broad range of frequencies (10 Hz to 5 MHz) using a commercial well with in-plane electrodes. At low frequencies in both 2D and 3D models it was observed that protein adsorption influences the magnitude of the impedance for the cell-free samples. This effect was eliminated once cells were introduced to the systems. Cell proliferation could be monitored in 2D at intermediate frequencies (30 kHz). However, the in-plane electrodes were unable to detect any changes in the impedance at any frequency when the cells were cultured in the 3D collagen gel. The results suggest that in designing impedance measurement devices, both the nature and distribution of the cells within the 3D culture as well as the architecture of the electrodes are key variables.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shen, Chih-hao</author><author>Lin, Jr-yu</author><author>Lu, Cheng-yo</author><author>Yang, Sung-Sen</author><author>Peng, Chung-Kan</author><author>Huang, Kun-Lun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SPAK-p38 MAPK Signal Pathway Modulates Claudin-18 and Barrier Function of Alveolar Epithelium after Hyperoxic Exposure</title><secondary-title>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Pulmonary Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>58</issue><keywords><keyword>alanine-rich kinase</keyword><keyword>alveolar epithelium</keyword><keyword>claudin-18</keyword><keyword>hyperoxia</keyword><keyword>sps1-related proline</keyword><keyword>ste20</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12890-021-01408-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SPAK-p38 MAPK Signal Pathway Modulates Claudin-18 and Barrier Function of Alveolar Epithelium after Hyperoxic Exposure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12890-021-01408-7</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Modeling;TEER</label><abstract>Background Hyperoxia downregulates the tight junction (TJ) proteins of the alveolar epithelium and leads to barrier dysfunction. Previous study has showed that STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) interferes with the intestinal barrier function in mice. The aim of the present study is to explore the association between SPAK and barrier function in the alveolar epithelium after hyperoxic exposure. Methods Hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) was induced by exposing mice to &gt; 99% oxygen for 64 h. The mice were randomly allotted into four groups comprising two control groups and two hyperoxic groups with and without SPAK knockout. Mouse alveolar MLE-12 cells were cultured in control and hyperoxic conditions with or without SPAK knockdown. Transepithelial electric resistance and transwell monolayer permeability were measured for each group. In-cell western assay was used to screen the possible mechanism of p-SPAK being induced by hyperoxia. Results Compared with the control group, SPAK knockout mice had a lower protein level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in HALI, which was correlated with a lower extent of TJ disruption according to transmission electron microscopy. Hyperoxia down-regulated claudin-18 in the alveolar epithelium, which was alleviated in SPAK knockout mice. In MLE-12 cells, hyperoxia up-regulated phosphorylated-SPAK by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was inhibited by indomethacin. Compared with the control group, SPAK knockdown MLE-12 cells had higher transepithelial electrical resistance and lower transwell monolayer permeability after hyperoxic exposure. The expression of claudin-18 was suppressed by hyperoxia, and down-regulation of SPAK restored the expression of claudin-18. The process of SPAK suppressing the expression of claudin-18 and impairing the barrier function was mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Conclusions Hyperoxia up-regulates the SPAK-p38 MAPK signal pathway by ROS, which disrupts the TJ of the alveolar epithelium by suppressing the expression of claudin-18. The down-regulation of SPAK attenuates this process and protects the alveolar epithelium against the barrier dysfunction induced by hyperoxia.

This study investigated the inhibitory effect underlying mechanisms of Salon transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. Sal solidly blocked cell migration and invasion enhancement by TGF-β1-induced EMT, through recovering E-cadherin loss and suppressing mesenchymal markers induction, as well as TGF-β1-mediated AMPK/SIRT signaling activity upregulation. The pharmacologic inhibition or knockdown of AMPK or SIRT1 can act synergistically with Sal to inhibit TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9. In contrast, AMPK or SIRT1 upregulation can protect against TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibition by Sal. Next we demonstrated that the MMP-2 and MMP-9 knockdown can act synergistically with Sal to inhibit TGF-β1-induced EMT. Moreover, treatment of PMA of MMP activator increased TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9, even with Sal. Our results demonstrate that Sal suppresses TGF-β1-induced EMT by downregulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the AMPK/SIRT pathway, thereby inhibiting lung cancer cell migration and invasion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Qing</author><author>Zemskov, Evgeny A.</author><author>Sun, Xutong</author><author>Wang, Hui</author><author>Yegambaram, Manivannan</author><author>Wu, Xiaomin</author><author>Garcia-Flores, Alejandro</author><author>Song, Shanshan</author><author>Tang, Haiyang</author><author>Kangath, Archana</author><author>Cabanillas, Gabriela Zubiate</author><author>Yuan, Jason X.J.</author><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Fineman, Jeffrey R.</author><author>Black, Stephen M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activation of the mechanosensitive Ca2+ channel TRPV4 induces endothelial barrier permeability via the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics</title><secondary-title>Redox Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Redox Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>101785</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>August 2020</issue><keywords><keyword>Barrier permeability</keyword><keyword>Mitochondrial bioenergetics</keyword><keyword>PKCα</keyword><keyword>TRPV4</keyword><keyword>VILI</keyword><keyword>eNOS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.redox.2020.101785</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Activation of the mechanosensitive Ca2+ channel TRPV4 induces endothelial barrier permeability via the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101785</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention in critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a refractory lung disease with an unacceptable high mortality rate. Paradoxically, mechanical ventilation also creates excessive mechanical stress that directly augments lung injury, a syndrome known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The specific mechanisms involved in VILI-induced pulmonary capillary leakage, a key pathologic feature of VILI are still far from resolved. The mechanoreceptor, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4, TRPV4 plays a key role in the development of VILI through unresolved mechanism. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling plays an important role in sepsis-mediated ARDS so in this study we investigated whether there is a role for eNOS uncoupling in the barrier disruption associated with TRPV4 activation during VILI. Our data indicate that the TRPV4 agonist, 4α-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD) induces pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption through the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mechanistically, this occurs via the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS secondary to a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at Threonine 495 (T495). A specific decoy peptide to prevent T495 phosphorylation reduced eNOS uncoupling and mitochondrial redistribution and preserved PAEC barrier function under 4αPDD challenge. Further, our eNOS decoy peptide was able to preserve lung vascular integrity in a mouse model of VILI. Thus, we have revealed a functional link between TRPV4 activation, PKC-dependent eNOS phosphorylation at T495, and EC barrier permeability. Reducing pT495-eNOS could be a new therapeutic approach for the prevention of VILI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kubra, Khadeja Tul</author><author>Uddin, Mohammad A.</author><author>Akhter, Mohammad S.</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Luminespib counteracts the Kifunensine-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Current Research in Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Research in Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>111-115</pages><volume>1</volume><keywords><keyword>Acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>P53</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>The Author(s)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.crtox.2020.09.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Luminespib counteracts the Kifunensine-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crtox.2020.09.003</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;TEER</label><abstract>Unfolded protein response (UPR) suppression by Kifunensine has been associated with lung hyperpermeability, the hallmark of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

The chromosomal fragile site gene, WWOX, is highly susceptible to genotoxic stress from environmental exposures and thus an interesting candidate gene for the study of exposure-related lung disease. Lungs harvested from current versus former/never-smokers exhibited a 47% decrease in WWOX mRNA levels. Exposure to nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapor resulted in an average 57% decrease in WWOX mRNA levels relative to vehicle-treated controls. In separate studies, endothelial (EC)-specific WWOX knockout (KO) versus WWOX flox control mice were examined under ARDS-producing conditions. EC WWOX KO mice exhibited significantly greater levels of vascular leak and histologic lung injury. ECs were isolated from digested lungs of untreated EC WWOX KO mice using sorting by flow cytometry for CD311 CD452cells. These were grown in culture, confirmed to be WWOX deficient by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and analyzed by electric cell impedance sensing as well as an FITC dextran transwell assay for their barrier properties during methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or LPS exposure. WWOX KO ECs demonstrated significantly greater declines in barrier function relative to cells from WWOX flox controls during either methicillin-resistant S. aureus or LPS treatment as measured by both electric cell impedance sensing and the transwell assay. The increased risk for ARDS observed in chronic smokers may be mechanistically linked, at least in part, to lung WWOX downregulation, and this phenomenon may also manifest in the near future in chronic users of e-cigarettes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lennikov, Anton</author><author>Mukwaya, Anthony</author><author>Saddala, Madhu Sudhana</author><author>Huang, Hu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deficiency of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) gene causes dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium cells</title><secondary-title>Laboratory Investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Laboratory Investigation</full-title></periodical><pages>228-244</pages><volume>101</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><isbn>4137402000</isbn><accession-num>32994482</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41374-020-00491-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-00491-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Homeostasis of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for the health and proper function of the retina. Regulation of RPE homeostasis is, however, largely unexplored, yet dysfunction of this process may lead to retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we report that chemokine receptor CXCR5 regulates RPE homeostasis through PI3K/AKT signaling and by suppression of FOXO1 activation. We used primary RPE cells isolated from CXCR5-deficient mice and wild type controls, as well as ex vivo RPE–choroidal–scleral complexes (RCSC) to investigate the regulation of homeostasis. CXCR5 expression in mouse RPE cells was diminished by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Lack of CXCR5 expression leads to an abnormal cellular shape, pigmentation, decreased expression of the RPE differentiation marker RPE65, an increase in the undifferentiated progenitor marker MITF, and compromised RPE barrier function, as well as compromised cell-to-cell interaction. An increase in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (αSMA, N-cadherin, and vimentin) was noted in CXCR5-deficient RPE cells both in vitro and in age-progression specimens of CXCR5−/− mice (6, 12, 24-months old). Deregulated autophagy in CXCR5-deficient RPE cells was observed by decreased LC3B-II, increased p62, abnormal autophagosomes, and impaired lysosome enzymatic activity as shown by GFP-LC3-RFP reporter plasmid. Mechanistically, deficiency in CXCR5 resulted in the downregulation of PI3K and AKT signaling, but upregulation and nuclear localization of FOXO1. Additionally, inhibition of PI3K in RPE cells resulted in an increased expression of FOXO1. Inhibition of FOXO1, however, reverts the degradation of ZO-1 caused by CXCR5 deficiency. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCR5 maintains PI3K/AKT signaling, which controls FOXO1 activation, thereby regulating the expression of genes involved in RPE EMT and autophagy deregulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hildebrandt, Susanne</author><author>Kampfrath, Branka</author><author>Fischer, Kristin</author><author>Hildebrand, Laura</author><author>Haupt, Julia</author><author>Stachelscheid, Harald</author><author>Knaus, Petra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ActivinA Induced SMAD1/5 Signaling in an iPSC Derived EC Model of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) Can Be Rescued by the Drug Candidate Saracatinib</title><secondary-title>Stem Cell Reviews and Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Stem Cell Reviews and Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1039-1052</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Activin</keyword><keyword>BMP-receptor</keyword><keyword>FOP</keyword><keyword>HO</keyword><keyword>Human endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Saracatinib</keyword><keyword>iPSCs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Stem Cell Reviews and Reports</publisher><accession-num>33410098</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12015-020-10103-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-10103-9</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Balanced signal transduction is crucial in tissue patterning, particularly in the vasculature. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is tightly linked to vascularization with increased vessel number in hereditary forms of HO, such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is caused by mutations in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 leading to aberrant SMAD1/5 signaling in response to ActivinA. Whether observed vascular phenotype in human FOP lesions is connected to aberrant ActivinA signaling is unknown. Blocking of ActivinA prevents HO in FOP mice indicating a central role of the ligand in FOP. Here, we established a new FOP endothelial cell model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iECs) to study ActivinA signaling. FOP iECs recapitulate pathogenic ActivinA/SMAD1/5 signaling. Whole transcriptome analysis identified ActivinA mediated activation of the BMP/NOTCH pathway exclusively in FOP iECs, which was rescued to WT transcriptional levels by the drug candidate Saracatinib. We propose that ActivinA causes transcriptional pre-patterning of the FOP endothelium, which might contribute to differential vascularity in FOP lesions compared to non-hereditary HO.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kovacs-Kasa, Anita</author><author>Kovacs, Laszlo</author><author>Cherian-Shaw, Mary</author><author>Patel, Vijay</author><author>Meadows, Mary L.</author><author>Fulton, David J.</author><author>Su, Yunchao</author><author>Verin, Alexander D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of Class IIa HDACs improves endothelial barrier function in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cellular Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cellular Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>236</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Class IIA HDACs inhibition</keyword><keyword>LPS</keyword><keyword>TMP269</keyword><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>barrier protection</keyword><keyword>pulmonary endothelium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32959895</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcp.30053</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30053</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity;TEER</label><abstract>Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory process arises from a wide range of lung insults. A major cause of ALI is dysfunction of the pulmonary vascular endothelial barrier but the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. The therapeutic potential of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases is increasingly apparent, but the mechanisms by which HDACs regulate pulmonary vascular barrier function remain to be resolved. We found that specific Class IIa HDACs inhibitor, TMP269, significantly attenuated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) barrier compromise in vitro and improved vascular barrier integrity and lung function in murine model of ALI in vivo. TMP269 decreased LPS-induced myosin light chain phosphorylation suggesting the role for Class IIa HDACs in LPS-induced cytoskeleton reorganization. TMP269 did not affect microtubule structure and tubulin acetylation in contrast to the HDAC6-specific inhibitor, Tubastatin A suggesting that Class IIa HDACs and HDAC6 (Class IIb) regulate endothelial cytoskeleton and permeability via different mechanisms. Furthermore, LPS increased the expression of ArgBP2 which has recently been attributed to HDAC-mediated activation of Rho. Depletion of ArgBP2 abolished the ability of LPS to disrupt barrier function in HLMVEC and both TMP269 and Tubastatin A decreased the level of ArgBP2 expression after LPS stimulation suggesting that both Class IIa and IIb HDACs regulate endothelial permeability via ArgBP2-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our data strongly suggest that Class IIa HDACs are involved in LPS-induced ALI in vitro and in vivo via specific mechanism which involved contractile responses, but not microtubule reorganization.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Posta, Niké</author><author>Csősz, Éva</author><author>Oros, Melinda</author><author>Pethő, Dávid</author><author>Potor, László</author><author>Kalló, Gergő</author><author>Hendrik, Zoltán</author><author>Sikura, Katalin Éva</author><author>Méhes, Gábor</author><author>Tóth, Csaba</author><author>Posta, József</author><author>Balla, György</author><author>Balla, József</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemoglobin oxidation generates globin-derived peptides in atherosclerotic lesions and intraventricular hemorrhage of the brain, provoking endothelial dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Laboratory Investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Laboratory Investigation</full-title></periodical><pages>986-1002</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32054994</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41374-020-0403-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-0403-x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>The lysis of red blood cells was shown to occur in human ruptured atherosclerotic lesions and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of the brain. Liberated cell-free hemoglobin was found to undergo oxidation in both pathologies. We hypothesize that hemoglobin-derived peptides are generated during hemoglobin oxidation both in complicated atherosclerotic lesions and IVH of the brain, triggering endothelial cell dysfunction. Oxidized hemoglobin and its products were followed with spectrophotometry, LC–MS/MS analysis and detection of the cross-linking of globin chains in complicated atherosclerotic lesions of the human carotid artery and the hemorrhaged cerebrospinal liquid of preterm infants. The vascular pathophysiologic role of oxidized hemoglobin and the resultant peptides was assessed by measuring endothelial integrity, the activation of endothelial cells and the induction of proinflammatory genes. Peptide fragments of hemoglobin (VNVDEVGGEALGRLLVVYPWTQR, LLVVYPWTQR, MFLSFPTTK, VGAHAGEYGAELERMFLSFPTTK, and FLASVSTVLTSKYR) were identified in ruptured atherosclerotic lesions and in IVH of the human brain. Fragments resulting from the oxidation of hemoglobin were accompanied by the accumulation of ferryl hemoglobin. Similar to complicated atherosclerotic lesions of the human carotid artery, a high level of oxidized and cross-linked hemoglobin was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid after IVH. Haptoglobin inhibited hemoglobin fragmentation provoked by peroxide. The resultant peptides failed to bind haptoglobin or albumin. Peptides derived from hemoglobin oxidation and ferryl hemoglobin induced intercellular gap formation, decreased junctional resistance in the endothelium, and enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Enhanced expression of TNF and the activation of NLRP3 and CASP1 followed by the increased generation of IL-1β and nuclear translocation of the NF-κβ transcription factor occurred in response to hemoglobin-derived peptides, and ferryl hemoglobin in endothelium was upregulated in both pathologies. We conclude that the oxidation of hemoglobin in complicated atherosclerotic lesions and intraventricular hemorrhage of the brain generates peptide fragments and ferryl hemoglobin with the potential to trigger endothelial cell dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bi, Jianbin</author><author>Zhang, Jia</author><author>Ren, Yifan</author><author>Du, Zhaoqing</author><author>Li, Teng</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Zhang, Lin</author><author>Wang, Mengzhou</author><author>Wu, Zheng</author><author>Lv, Yi</author><author>Wu, Rongqian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Irisin reverses intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal injury via binding to the integrin αVβ5 receptor</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>996-1009</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AMP-activated protein kinase</keyword><keyword>UCP 2</keyword><keyword>enterocytes</keyword><keyword>gut barrier function</keyword><keyword>integrin αVβ5</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31701659</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jcmm.14811</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Irisin reverses intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal injury via binding to the integrin αVβ5 receptor.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fjcmm.14811</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Disruption of the gut barrier results in severe clinical outcomes with no specific treatment. Metabolic disorders and destruction of enterocytes play key roles in gut barrier dysfunction. Irisin is a newly identified exercise hormone that regulates energy metabolism. However, the effect of irisin on gut barrier function remains unknown. The therapeutic effect of irisin on gut barrier dysfunction was evaluated in gut ischemia reperfusion (IR). The direct effect of irisin on gut barrier function was studied in Caco-2 cells. Here, we discovered that serum and gut irisin levels were decreased during gut IR and that treatment with exogenous irisin restored gut barrier function after gut IR in mice. Meanwhile, irisin decreased oxidative stress, calcium influx and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after gut IR. Moreover, irisin protected mitochondrial function and reduced enterocyte apoptosis. The neutralizing antibody against irisin significantly aggravated gut injury, oxidative stress and enterocyte apoptosis after gut IR. Further studies revealed that irisin activated the AMPK-UCP 2 pathway via binding to the integrin αVβ5 receptor. Inhibition of integrin αVβ5, AMPK or UCP 2 abolished the protective role of irisin in gut barrier function. In conclusion, exogenous irisin restores gut barrier function after gut IR via the integrin αVβ5-AMPK-UCP 2 pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Zhao</author><author>Yin, Mingzhu</author><author>Zhang, Haifeng</author><author>Ni, Weiming</author><author>Pierce, Richard W.</author><author>Zhou, Huanjiao Jenny</author><author>Min, Wang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BMX Represses Thrombin-PAR1-Mediated Endothelial Permeability and Vascular Leakage During Early Sepsis</title><secondary-title>Circulation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>471-485</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BMX</keyword><keyword>PAR1</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>thrombin</keyword><keyword>vascular endothelium</keyword><keyword>vascular permeability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>3902264330</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315769</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BMX Represses Thrombin-PAR1-Mediated Endothelial Permeability and Vascular Leakage During Early Sepsis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1161%2FCIRCRESAHA.119.315769</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Rationale: Bone marrow kinase on the X chromosome (BMX) is highly expressed in the arterial endothelium from the embryonic stage to the adult stage in mice. It is also expressed in microvessels and the lymphatics in response to pathological stimuli. However, its role in endothelial permeability and sepsis remains unknown. Objective: We aimed to delineate the function of BMX in thrombin-mediated endothelial permeability and the vascular leakage that occurs with sepsis in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models Methods and Results: The CLP model was applied to wild-type and BMX knockout mice to induce sepsis. Meanwhile, the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing assay was used to detect trans-endothelial electrical resistance in vitro and the modified Miles assay was used to evaluate vascular leakage in vivo. We showed that BMX loss caused lung injury and inflammation in early CLP-induced sepsis. Disruption of BMX increased thrombin-mediated permeability in mice and cultured endothelial cells (ECs) by 2–3-fold. The expression of BMX in macrophages, neutrophils, platelets and lung epithelial cells was undetectable compared with that in ECs, indicating that endothelium dysfunction, rather than leukocyte and platelet dysfunction, was involved in vascular permeability and sepsis. Mechanistically, biochemical and cellular analyses demonstrated that BMX specifically repressed thrombin-protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) signaling in ECs by directly phosphorylating PAR1 and promoting its internalization and deactivation. Importantly, pre-treatment with the selective PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 rescued BMX loss-mediated endothelial permeability and pulmonary leakage in early CLP-induced sepsis. Conclusion: Acting as a negative regulator of PAR1, BMX promotes PAR1 internalization and signal inactivation through PAR1 phosphorylation. Moreover, BMX-mediated PAR1 internalization attenuates endothelial permeability to protect vascular leakage during early sepsis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Fan</author><author>Qiu, Wuxia</author><author>Wang, Pai</author><author>Zhang, Ru</author><author>Chen, Zhihao</author><author>Su, Peihong</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Li, Dijie</author><author>Yang, Chaofei</author><author>Chen, Lei</author><author>Yin, Chong</author><author>Tian, Ye</author><author>Hu, Lifang</author><author>Li, Yu</author><author>Zhang, Ge</author><author>Wu, Xiaoyang</author><author>Qian, Airong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mesenchymal MACF1 Facilitates SMAD7 Nuclear Translocation to Drive Bone Formation</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>616</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells9030616</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mesenchymal MACF1 Facilitates SMAD7 Nuclear Translocation to Drive Bone Formation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells9030616</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Proliferation</label><abstract>Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) is a large crosslinker that contributes to cell integrity and cell differentiation. Recent studies show that MACF1 is involved in multiple cellular functions such as neuron development and epidermal migration, and is the molecular basis for many degenerative diseases. MACF1 is highly abundant in bones, especially in mesenchymal stem cells; however, its regulatory role is still less understood in bone formation and degenerative bone diseases. In this study, we found MACF1 expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of osteoporotic bone specimens was significantly lower. By conditional gene targeting to delete the mesenchymal Macf1 gene in mice, we observed in MSCs decreased osteogenic differentiation capability. During early stage bone development, the MACF1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibit significant ossification retardation in skull and hindlimb, and by adulthood, mesenchymal loss of MACF1 attenuated bone mass, bone microarchitecture, and bone formation capability significantly. Further, we showed that MACF1 interacts directly with SMAD family member 7 (SMAD7) and facilitates SMAD7 nuclear translocation to initiate downstream osteogenic pathways. Hopefully these findings will expand the biological scope of the MACF1 gene, and provide an experimental basis for targeting MACF1 in degenerative bone diseases such as osteoporosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uddin, Mohammad A.</author><author>Akhter, Mohommad S.</author><author>Kubra, Khadeja-Tul</author><author>Siejka, Agnieszka</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metformin in acute respiratory distress syndrome: An opinion</title><secondary-title>Experimental Gerontology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Gerontology</full-title></periodical><volume>145</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exger.2020.111197</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Metformin in acute respiratory distress syndrome An opinion.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.exger.2020.111197</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;TEER</label><abstract>Senior individuals are more susceptible to the irreversible outcomes of endothelial barrier dysfunction, the hallmark of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Endothelial hyperpermeability has been associated with both the progression and establishment of the COVID-19 - related respiratory failure. In the present study we investigated the in vitro effects of Metformin in the permeability of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Our preliminary results suggest that moderate doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mM) of this anti-diabetic agent enhance the vascular barrier integrity, since it produces an increase in the transendothelial resistance of endothelial monolayers.

These processes allow cells to respond and adapt to changes in their environment, and are crucial for most cellular functions. Understanding the mechanism underlying this complex interplay at the cell-matrix interface is of fundamental value to decipher key biochemical and mechanical factors regulating cell fate. The combination of material science and surface chemistry aided in the creation of controllable environments to study cell mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Biologically inspired materials tailored with specific bioactive molecules, desired physical properties and tunable topography have emerged as suitable tools to study cell behavior. Among these materials, synthetic cell interfaces with built-in sensing capabilities are highly advantageous to measure biophysical and biochemical interaction between cells and their environment. In this review, we discuss the design of micro and nanostructured biomaterials engineered not only to mimic the structure, properties, and function of the cellular microenvironment, but also to obtain quantitative information on how cells sense and probe specific adhesive cues from the extracellular domain. This type of responsive biointerfaces provides a readout of mechanics, biochemistry, and electrical activity in real time allowing observation of cellular processes with molecular specificity. Specifically designed sensors based on advanced optical and electrochemical readout are discussed. We further provide an insight into the emerging role of multifunctional micro and nanosensors to control and monitor cell functions by means of material design.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chalklen, Thomas</author><author>Jing, Qingshen</author><author>Kar-Narayan, Sohini</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biosensors based on mechanical and electrical detection techniques</title><secondary-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><pages>26-37</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Biosensors</keyword><keyword>Electrical biosensor</keyword><keyword>MEMS biosensor</keyword><keyword>Mechanical biosensor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33007906</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s20195605</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Biosensors Based on Mechanical and Electrical Detection Techniques.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/s20195605</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review;Theory</label><abstract>Biosensors are powerful analytical tools for biology and biomedicine, with applications ranging from drug discovery to medical diagnostics, food safety, and agricultural and environmental monitoring. Typically, biological recognition receptors, such as enzymes, antibodies, and nucleic acids, are immobilized on a surface, and used to interact with one or more specific analytes to produce a physical or chemical change, which can be captured and converted to an optical or electrical signal by a transducer. However, many existing biosensing methods rely on chemical, electrochemical and optical methods of identification and detection of specific targets, and are often: complex, expensive, time consuming, suffer from a lack of portability, or may require centralised testing by qualified personnel. Given the general dependence of most optical and electrochemical techniques on labelling molecules, this review will instead focus on mechanical and electrical detection techniques that can provide information on a broad range of species without the requirement of labelling. These techniques are often able to provide data in real time, with good temporal sensitivity. This review will cover the advances in the development of mechanical and electrical biosensors, highlighting the challenges and opportunities therein.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lennikov, Anton</author><author>Mukwaya, Anthony</author><author>Fan, Lijuan</author><author>Saddala, Madhu Sudhana</author><author>De Falco, Sandro</author><author>Huang, Hu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synergistic interactions of PlGF and VEGF contribute to blood-retinal barrier breakdown through canonical NFκB activation</title><secondary-title>Experimental Cell Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Cell Research</full-title></periodical><pages>112347</pages><volume>397</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-retinal barrier</keyword><keyword>IKK2</keyword><keyword>IMD0354</keyword><keyword>NFκB</keyword><keyword>PlGF</keyword><keyword>PlGF-VEGF</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>33130176</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112347</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Synergistic interactions of PlGF and VEGF contribute to blood-retinal barrier breakdown through canonical NFκB activation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112347</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>To investigate the role of placental growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (PlGF-VEGF) heterodimers are involved in the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and the associated mechanism, human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with recombinant human (rh)PlGF-VEGF heterodimers and rhPlGF and studied in normal and high-glucose conditions. HREC barrier function was evaluated by the measurement of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Adeno-Associated Virus Type 5 (AAV5) vectors overexpressed PlGF in the retina by intravitreal injection into the C57BL6 mouse eye. AAV5-GFP vector and naïve animals were used as controls. Immunofluorescence (IF) and western blots examined the protein expression of PlGF-VEGF heterodimers, VEGF, PlGF, NFκB, p-IκBα, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin in HREC and mouse retina. PlGF-VEGF heterodimers were detected predominantly in the HREC cell nuclei based on IF and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation experiments. High glucose treatment increased PlGF-VEGF nuclear abundance. Dot immunoblotting demonstrated a strong affinity of the 5D11D4 antibody to PlGF-VEGF heterodimers. rhPlGF-VEGF disrupted the barrier function of HREC, which was prevented by the neutralization of PlGF-VEGF by the 5D11D4 antibody. Stimulation of HRECs with rhPlGF also led to an increase in the nuclear signals for PlGF-VEGF, p-IκBα, and colocalization of NFκB p65 and PlGF-VEGF in the nuclei. The selective IKK2 inhibitor IMD0354 disrupted the nuclear colocalization. Treatment with IMD0354 restored the barrier function of HREC, as indicated by the ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression. In the mouse retinas, PlGF overexpression by AAV5 vector reduced ZO-1 expression and increased abundance of pIκBα. PIGF/VEGF heterodimers mediate BRB breakdown potentially through the canonical NFκB activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ménard, Catherine</author><author>M.

In acute myeloid leukemia, a frequent NPM mutation occurring at the C-terminus causes NPM delocalization to the cytoplasm. Due to formation of NPM heterooligomers, the wild-type NPM as well as many of NPM interaction partners are also delocalized. Proper localization and function of mislocalized proteins in the cells with mutated NPM may be restored by targeting NPM oligomerization. We introduce a reliable set of complementary methods for monitoring NPM oligomerization in both cell lysates and live cells. Using this methodological background we show that a putative inhibitor of NPM oligomerization, NSC348884, does not prevent formation of NPM oligomers in leukemia cells.

These electrical properties will provide important information about unique biomarkers related to the behavior of these cancerous cells, especially monitoring their chemoresistivity and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. There are currently few methods to assess drug resistant cancer cells, and therefore it is difficult to identify and eliminate drug-resistant cancer cells found in static and metastatic tumors. Establishing techniques for the real-time monitoring of changes in cancer cell phenotypes is, therefore, important for understanding cancer cell dynamics and their plastic properties. EIS can be used to monitor these changes. In this review, we will cover the theory behind EIS, other impedance techniques, and how EIS can be used to monitor cell behavior and phenotype changes within cancerous cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeng, Yinduo</author><author>Qin, Tao</author><author>Flamini, Valentina</author><author>Tan, Cui</author><author>Zhang, Xinke</author><author>Cong, Yizi</author><author>Birkin, Emily</author><author>Wen, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of DHX36 as a tumour suppressor through modulating the activities of the stress-associated proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases in breast cancer</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>4211-4233</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>cdk</keyword><keyword>dhx36</keyword><keyword>progression</keyword><keyword>stress-associated protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Identification of DHX36 as a tumour suppressor through modulating the activities of the stress-associated proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases in breast cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7783738/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The nucleic acid guanine-quadruplex structures (G4s) are involved in many aspects of cancer progression. The DEAH-box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) has been identified as a dominant nucleic acid helicase which targets and disrupts DNA and RNA G4s in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the actual role of DHX36 in breast cancer remains unknown. In this study, we observed that the gene expression of DHX36 was positively associated with patient survival in breast cancer. The abundance of DHX36 is also linked with pathologic conditions and the stage of breast cancer. By using the xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that the stable knockdown of DHX36 via lentivirus in breast cancer cells significantly promoted tumour growth. We also found that, after the DHX36 knockdown (KD), the invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells was enhanced. In addition, we found a significant increase in the number of cells in the S-phase and a reduction of apoptosis with the response to cisplatin. DHX36 KD also desensitized the cytotoxic cellular response to paclitaxel and cisplatin. Transcriptomic profiling analysis by RNA sequencing indicated that DHX36 altered gene expression profile through the upstream activation of TNF, IFNγ, NFκb and TGFβ1. High throughput signalling analysis showed that one cluster of stress-associated kinase proteins including p53, ROCK1 and JNK were suppressed, while the mitotic checkpoint protein-serine kinases CDK1 and CDK2 were activated, as a consequence of the DHX36 knockdown. Our study reveals that DHX36 functions as a tumour suppressor and may be considered as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>von Palubitzki, Lydia</author><author>Wang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Hoffmann, Stefan</author><author>Vidal-y-Sy, Sabine</author><author>Zobiak, Bernd</author><author>Failla, Antonio V.</author><author>Schmage, Petra</author><author>John, Axel</author><author>Osorio-Madrazo, Anayancy</author><author>Bauer, Alexander T.</author><author>Schneider, Stefan W.</author><author>Goycoolea, Francisco M.</author><author>Gorzelanny, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences of the tumour cell glycocalyx affect binding of capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanocapsules</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>4159802079</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-79882-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Differences of the tumour cell glycocalyx affect binding of capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanocapsules.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79882-y</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>The glycocalyx regulates the interaction of mammalian cells with extracellular molecules, such as cytokines. However, it is unknown to which extend the glycocalyx of distinct cancer cells control the binding and uptake of nanoparticles. In the present study, exome sequencing data of cancer patients and analysis of distinct melanoma and bladder cancer cell lines suggested differences in cancer cell-exposed glycocalyx components such as heparan sulphate. Our data indicate that glycocalyx differences affected the binding of cationic chitosan nanocapsules (Chi-NCs). The pronounced glycocalyx of bladder cancer cells enhanced the internalisation of nanoencapsulated capsaicin. Consequently, capsaicin induced apoptosis in the cancer cells, but not in the less glycosylated benign urothelial cells. Moreover, we measured counterion condensation on highly negatively charged heparan sulphate chains. Counterion condensation triggered a cooperative binding of Chi-NCs, characterised by a weak binding rate at low Chi-NC doses and a strongly increased binding rate at high Chi-NC concentrations. Our results indicate that the glycocalyx of tumour cells controls the binding and biological activity of nanoparticles. This has to be considered for the design of tumour cell directed nanocarriers to improve the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Differential nanoparticle binding may also be useful to discriminate tumour cells from healthy cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Shenglong</author><author>Tang, Chaogang</author><author>Ding, Hongguang</author><author>Wang, Zhonghua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Maf1 Ameliorates Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Suppressing the NF- k B / NLRP3 In fl ammasome Signaling Pathway</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>December</issue><keywords><keyword>Maf1</keyword><keyword>NF-κB</keyword><keyword>NLRP3 inflammasome</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>blood–brain barrier disruption</keyword><keyword>brain barrier disruption</keyword><keyword>equally to this work</keyword><keyword>maf1</keyword><keyword>nf- k b</keyword><keyword>nlrp3 in fl ammasome</keyword><keyword>sepsis-associated encephalopathy</keyword><keyword>these authors have contributed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2020.594071</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Maf1 Ameliorates Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Suppressing the NF-kB NLRP3 Inflammasome Signaling Pathway.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been identified as an important mediator of blood–brain-barrier disruption in sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). However, no information is available concerning the critical upstream regulators of SAE. Methods Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish an in vitro model of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and an in vivo model of SAE. Disruption of BBB integrity was assessed by measuring the expression levels of tight-junction proteins. NLRP3 inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and neuroapoptosis were measured using biochemical assays. Finally, the FITC-dextran Transwell assay and Evan’s blue dye assay were used to assess the effect of Maf1 on LPS-induced endothelial permeability in vitro and in vivo. Results We found that Maf1 significantly suppressed the brain inflammatory response and neuroapoptosis induced by LPS in vivo and in vitro. Notably, Maf1 downregulated activation of the NF-κB/p65-induced NLRP3 inflammasome and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we found that Maf1 and p65 directly bound to the NLRP3 gene promoter region and competitively regulated the function of NLRP3 in inflammations. Moreover, overexpression of NLRP3 reversed the effects of p65 on BBB integrity, apoptosis, and inflammation in response to LPS. Our study revealed novel role for Maf1 in regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammasome formation, which plays a prominent role in SAE. Conclusions Regulation of Maf1 might be a therapeutic strategy for SAE and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Immler, Roland</author><author>Lange-Sperandio, Bärbel</author><author>Steffen, Tobias</author><author>Beck, Heike</author><author>Roth, Jonas</author><author>Hupel, Georg</author><author>Pfister, Frederik</author><author>Popper, Bastian</author><author>Uhl, Bernd</author><author>Mannell, Hanna</author><author>Reichel, Christoph</author><author>Vielhauer, Volker</author><author>Scherberich, Jürgen</author><author>Sperandio, Markus</author><author>Pruenster, Monika</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extratubular polymerized uromodulin induces leukocyte recruitment and inflammation in vivo</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>December</issue><keywords><keyword>damage associated molecular pattern</keyword><keyword>damp</keyword><keyword>in fl ammation</keyword><keyword>leukocyte recruitment</keyword><keyword>uromodulin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.07.18.206508</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Extratubular Polymerized Uromodulin Induces Leukocyte Recruitment and Inflammation In Vivo.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Uromodulin (UMOD) is produced and secreted by tubular epithelial cells. Secreted UMOD polymerizes (pUMOD) in the tubular lumen, where it regulates salt transport and protects the kidney from bacteria and stone formation. Under various pathological conditions, pUMOD accumulates within the tubular lumen and reaches extratubular sites where it may interact with renal interstitial cells. Here, we investigated the potential of extratubular pUMOD to act as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule thereby creating local inflammation. We found that intrascrotal and intraperitoneal injection of pUMOD induced leukocyte recruitment in vivo and led to TNF-α secretion by F4/80 positive macrophages. Additionally, pUMOD directly affected vascular permeability and increased neutrophil extravasation independent of macrophage-released TNF-α. Interestingly, pUMOD displayed no chemotactic properties on neutrophils, did not directly activate β2 integrins and did not upregulate adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. In obstructed neonatal murine kidneys, we observed extratubular UMOD accumulation in the renal interstitium with tubular atrophy and leukocyte infiltrates. Finally, we found extratubular UMOD deposits associated with peritubular leukocyte infiltration in kidneys from patients with inflammatory kidney diseases. Taken together, we identified extratubular pUMOD as a strong inducer of leukocyte recruitment, underlining its critical role in mounting an inflammatory response in various kidneys pathologies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Translocation, Fosb</author><author>Salvatori, Daniela C F</author><author>Cao, Xu</author><author>Orlova, Valeria V</author><author>Ijzendoorn, David G P Van</author><author>Salvatori, Daniela C F</author><author>Cao, Xu</author><author>Hil, Francijna Van Den</author><author>Bruijn, Inge H Briaire-de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vascular Tumor Recapitulated in Endothelial Cells from hiPSCs Engineered to Express the SERPINE1- ll Vascular Tumor Recapitulated in Endothelial Cells from hiPSCs Engineered to Express the SERPINE1-FOSB Translocation</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>1</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100153</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Vascular Tumor Recapitulated in Endothelial Cells from hiPSCs Engineered to Express the SERPINE1-FOSB Translocation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.xcrm.2020.100153</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Chromosomal translocations are prevalent among soft tissue tumors, including those of the vasculature such as pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE). PHE shows endothelial cell (EC) features and has a tumor-specific t(7;19)(q22;q13) SERPINE1-FOSB translocation, but is difficult to study as no primary tumor cell lines have yet been derived. Here, we engineer the PHE chromosomal translocation into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using CRISPR/Cas9 and differentiate these into ECs (hiPSC-ECs) to address this. Comparison of parental with PHE hiPSC-ECs shows (1) elevated expression of FOSB, (2) higher proliferation and more tube formation but lower endothelial barrier function, (3) invasive growth and abnormal vessel formation in mice after transplantation, and (4) specific transcriptome alterations reflecting PHE and indicating PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways as possible therapeutic targets. The modified hiPSC-ECs thus recapitulate functional features of PHE and demonstrate how these translocation models can be used to understand tumorigenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gioia, Sante Di</author><author>Conese, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biological properties and therapeutic effects of plant - derived nanovesicles</title><secondary-title>Open Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1096-1122</pages><volume>15</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1515%2Fmed-2020-0160</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Biological properties and therapeutic effects of plant-derived nanovesicles.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1515%2Fmed-2020-0160</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>Exosomes-like nanoparticles can be released by a variety of plants and vegetables. The relevance of plantderived nanovesicles (PDNVs) in interspecies communication is derived from their content in biomolecules (lipids, proteins, and miRNAs), absence of toxicity, easy internalization by mammalian cells, as well as for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties. Due to these interesting features, we review here their potential application in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver diseases, and cancer as well as their potentiality as drug carriers. Current evidence indicate that PDNVs can improve the disease state at the level of intestine in IBD mouse models by affecting inflammation and promoting prohealing effects. While few reports suggest that anticancer effects can be derived from antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties of PDNVs, other studies have shown that PDNVs can be used as effective delivery systems for small molecule agents and nucleic acids with therapeutic effects (siRNAs, miRNAs, and DNAs). Finally, since PDNVs are characterized by a proven stability in the gastrointestinal tract, they have been considered as promising delivery systems for natural products contained therein and drugs (including nucleic acids) via the oral route.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hucklesby, James J.

The small currents used allow the label-free, real-time monitoring of the cells in a non-invasive manner. Despite the widespread use of these systems individually, direct comparisons between the systems have not been published. In order to compare the sensitivity of the instruments, the responses of the brain microvascular endothelial cell line hCMVEC to the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL1β were measured on all three instruments simultaneously. All three instruments showed transient decreases, followed by prolonged increases in impedance. Although xCELLigence could detect these changes, it was unable to determine which component of the barrier was affected. In contrast, ECIS and cellZscope were both able to attribute responses to particular barrier components, and ECIS had a higher sensitivity than cellZscope. Finally, as cellZscope uses Transwells, it allows access to the basolateral compartment, an important advantage of this technology. Furthermore, although xCELLigence readings are equivalent to ECIS, the reduced frequency range greatly limits interpretation. This work demonstrates that instruments must be carefully selected in order to ensure that they are appropriate for the experimental questions being asked.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Araujo, Vanessa</author><author>Santaterra, Gomes</author><author>Marx, Maiara</author><author>Fiusa, Luz</author><author>Hounkpe, Bidossessi Wilfried</author><author>Chenou, Francine</author><author>Tonasse, Wouitchekpo Vincent</author><author>Nilkenes, Loredana</author><author>Garcia-weber, Diego</author><author>Domingos, Igor De Farias</author><author>Bezerra, Cavalcante</author><author>Andre, Marcos</author><author>Lucena-arau, Antonio Roberto</author><author>Paula, Erich Vinicius De</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial Barrier Integrity Is Disrupted In Vitro by Heme and by Serum From Sickle Cell Disease Patients</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>December</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2020.535147</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial Barrier Integrity Is Disrupted In Vitro by Heme and by Serum From Sickle Cell Disease Patients.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.535147/full</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Free extracellular heme has been shown to activate several compartments of innate immunity, acting as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in hemolytic diseases. Although localized endothelial barrier (EB) disruption is an important part of inflammation that allows circulating leukocytes to reach inflamed tissues, non-localized/deregulated disruption of the EB can lead to widespread microvascular hyperpermeability and secondary tissue damage. In mouse models of sickle cell disease (SCD), EB disruption has been associated with the development of a form of acute lung injury that closely resembles acute chest syndrome (ACS), and that can be elicited by acute heme infusion. Here we explored the effect of heme on EB integrity using human endothelial cell monolayers, in experimental conditions that include elements that more closely resemble in vivo conditions. EB integrity was assessed by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing in the presence of varying concentrations of heme and sera from SCD patients or healthy volunteers. Heme caused a dose-dependent decrease of the electrical resistance of cell monolayers, consistent with EB disruption, which was confirmed by staining of junction protein VE-cadherin. In addition, sera from SCD patients, but not from healthy volunteers, were also capable to induce EB disruption. Interestingly, these effects were not associated with total heme levels in serum. However, when heme was added to sera from SCD patients, but not from healthy volunteers, EB disruption could be elicited, and this effect was associated with hemopexin serum levels. Together our in vitro studies provide additional support to the concept of heme as a DAMP in hemolytic conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhong, Tingting</author><author>Li, Yanling</author><author>He, Xiaohong</author><author>Liu, Yongdong</author><author>Dong, Yugang</author><author>Ma, Hong</author><author>Zheng, Zhensheng</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptation of endothelial cells to shear stress under atheroprone conditions by modulating internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin and vinculin</title><secondary-title>Annals of Translational Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Translational Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1423-1423</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>10</keyword><keyword>2020</keyword><keyword>21037</keyword><keyword>28</keyword><keyword>accepted for publication aug</keyword><keyword>atherosclerosis</keyword><keyword>atm-20-3426</keyword><keyword>doi</keyword><keyword>dx</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>focal adhesion</keyword><keyword>http</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>shear stress</keyword><keyword>submitted apr 20</keyword><keyword>view this article at</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.21037/atm-20-3426</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Adaptation of endothelial cells to shear stress under atheroprone conditions by modulating internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin and vinculin.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7723531/pdf/atm-08-21-1423.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background: Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology by providing a barrier to the bloodstream. In the current study, we investigated the phenotype and barrier function of endothelial cells in response to shear stress under pro-atherogenic conditions. Methods: Endothelial cells were exposed to laminar shear stress (LSS) in a parallel-plate flow chamber containing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the perfusion solution, or remained static. We quantified the response of endothelial monolayers to LSS and oxLDL in terms of cell viability, barrier integrity, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) availability, focal adhesion (FA) remodeling, and monocyte-endothelial interactions. Results: Our results showed that oxLDL stimulation and static conditions synergized to enhance endothelial barrier disruption. Under the same oxLDL challenge, the application of 25 dynes/cm2 LSS on the endothelial monolayer decreased the passage of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran by 37.79%, increased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) by 24.97% compared with static cells (P&lt;0.05), which was accompanied by reduced intercellular gap formation, relatively solid cell-substrate adhesion. Compared with static cells, endothelial cells exposed to both laminar flow and oxLDL had less small FAs, less monocyte adhesion and transmigration, and alleviated overexpression of VCAM-1 and MCP-1. Meanwhile, the oxLDL-induced internalization of VE-cadherin and vinculin were also attenuated by laminar flow, and this change was more pronounced at LSS of 25 dynes/cm2 than 5 dynes/cm2 . Conclusions: Static conditions favor, whereas physiologically higher levels of LSS ameliorate endothelial barrier disruption under pro-atherogenic stress, which is related to the improved availability of VE-cadherin and vinculin on the cell surface.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abe, Rei J.</author><author>Savage, Hannah</author><author>Imanishi, Masaki</author><author>Banerjee, Priyanka</author><author>Kotla, Sivareddy</author><author>Paez-Mayorga, Jesus</author><author>Taunton, Jack</author><author>Fujiwara, Keigi</author><author>Won, Jong Hak</author><author>Yusuf, Syed Wamique</author><author>Palaskas, Nicolas L.</author><author>Banchs, Jose</author><author>Lin, Steven H.</author><author>Schadler, Keri L.</author><author>Abe, Jun-ichi</author><author>Le, Nhat-Tu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p90RSK-MAGI1 Module Controls Endothelial Permeability by Post-translational Modifications of MAGI1 and Hippo Pathway</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>November</issue><keywords><keyword>&quot;p90RSK</keyword><keyword>EC permeability</keyword><keyword>Hippo pathway</keyword><keyword>MAGI1&quot;</keyword><keyword>SUMOylation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcvm.2020.542485</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://p90RSK-MAGI1 Module Controls Endothelial Permeability by Post-translational Modifications of MAGI1 and Hippo Pathway.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Previously, we reported that post-translational modifications (PTMs) of MAGI1, including S741 phosphorylation and K931 de-SUMOylation, both of which are regulated by p90RSK activation, lead to endothelial cell (EC) activation. However, roles for p90RSK and MAGI1-PTMs in regulating EC permeability remain unclear despite MAGI1 being a junctional molecule. Here, we show that thrombin (Thb)-induced EC permeability, detected by the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) based system, was decreased by overexpression of dominant negative p90RSK or a MAGI1-S741A phosphorylation mutant, but was accelerated by overexpression of p90RSK, siRNA-mediated knockdown of magi1, or the MAGI1-K931R SUMOylation mutant. MAGI1 depletion also increased the mRNA and protein expression of the large tumor suppressor kinases 1 and 2 (LATS1/2), which inhibited YAP/TAZ activity and increased EC permeability. Because the endothelial barrier is a critical mediator of tumor hypoxia, we also evaluated the role of p90RSK activation in tumor vessel leakiness by using a relatively low dose of the p90RSK specific inhibitor, FMK-MEA. FMK-MEA significantly inhibited tumor vessel leakiness at a dose that does not affect morphology and growth of tumor vessels in vivo. These results provide novel insights into crucial roles for p90RSK-mediated MAGI1 PTMs and the Hippo pathway in EC permeability, as well as p90RSK activation in tumor vessel leakiness.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pérez, P.</author><author>Serrano, J.

Third, simulates electrically the full system to define the best system parameter values for the sensor. Results: Reported experimental results are based on commercial gold electrodes and the AA8 cell line. Characteristics of the cell lines, as time-division or cell size, are incorporated into the program design flow, showing that for a given assay, the optimal OBT circuit parameters can be selected with the help of the computer tool. The electrical simulations of the full system demonstrate that the can be correctly predicted the output frequency and amplitude ranges of the voltage response, obtaining accurate results when cell culture approaches to confluence phase. Conclusion: It is proposed a computer program for system design of biosensors applied to monitoring cell culture dynamics. The program allows obtaining confident system information by electrical stimulation. All system components (electrodes, cell culture and test circuits) are properly modelled. The employed procedure can be applied to any other 2D electrode layout or alternative circuit technique for ECIS test. Finally, deep insight information on cell size, number, and time-division can be extracted from the comparison with real cell culture assays in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stolwijk, Judith A</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of adherent cells after in situ electroporation ‑ mediated delivery of bioactive proteins , DNA and nanoparticles in µL ‑ volumes</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-78096-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Impedance analysis of adherent cells after in situ electroporation-mediated delivery of bioactive proteins, DNA and nanoparticles in µL-volumes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78096-6</url></web-urls></urls><label>Electroporation</label><abstract>Specific intracellular manipulation of animal cells is a persistent goal in experimental cell biology. Such manipulations allow precise and targeted interference with signaling cascades, metabolic pathways, or bi-molecular interactions for subsequent tracking of functional consequences. However, most biomolecules capable of molecular recognition are membrane impermeable. The ability to introduce these molecules into the cytoplasm and then to apply appropriate readouts to monitor the corresponding cell response could prove to be an important research tool. This study describes such an experimental approach combining in situ electroporation (ISE) as a means to efficiently deliver biomolecules to the cytoplasm with an impedance-based, time-resolved analysis of cell status using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). In this approach, gold-film electrodes, deposited on the bottom of regular culture dishes, are used for both electroporation and monitoring. The design of the electrode layout and measurement chamber allows working with sample volumes as small as 10 µL. A miniaturized setup for combined electroporation and impedance sensing (µISE-ECIS) was applied to load different adherent cells with bioactive macromolecules including enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids and quantum dot nanoparticles. The cell response after loading the cytoplasm with RNase A or cytochrome c (in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitors) was tracked by non-invasive impedance readings in real-time.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Linda L</author><author>Khakoo, Aarif Y</author><author>Chintalgattu, Vishnu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiac pericytes function as key vasoactive cells to regulate homeostasis and disease</title><secondary-title>FEBS Open Bio</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEBS Open Bio</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>ardiac pericyte</keyword><keyword>heart</keyword><keyword>pericytes</keyword><keyword>perivascular cells</keyword><keyword>vascular biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13021</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13021</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Pericytes (PCs) ─ mural cells that envelop endothelial cells (ECs) of microvessels ─ regulate tissue-specific vasculature development as well as maturation and maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity. However, little is known about their tissue specific function in the heart. Specifically, the mechanism by which cardiac PCs constrict coronary capillaries remains undetermined. To gain insights into the function of cardiac PCs at the cellular level, we isolated NG2+ PDGFRβ+ CD146+ CD34- CD31- CD45- PCs for detailed characterization. Functionally, we provide evidence that these PCs increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and decreased endothelial permeability. We show for the first time that this population of PCs express contractile proteins, are stimulated by adrenergic signaling, and demonstrate stereotypical contraction and relaxation. Furthermore, we also studied for the first time, the PCs in in vitro models of disease. PCs in hypoxia activated the HIF-1α pathway, increased secretion of angiogenic factors and caused cellular apoptosis. Supra-physiological levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) decreased PC proliferation and induced lipid droplet accumulation. Elevated glucose levels triggered a pro-inflammatory response. Taken together, our study characterizes cardiac PCs under in vitro disease conditions and supports the hypothesis that cardiac PCs are key vasoactive cells that can regulate blood flow in the heart.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harman, Rebecca M</author><author>Patel, Roosheel S</author><author>Fan, Jennifer C</author><author>Park, Jee E</author><author>Rosenberg, Brad R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing of equine mesenchymal stromal cells from primary donor-matched tissue sources reveals functional heterogeneity in immune modulation and cell motility</title><secondary-title>Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell motility</keyword><keyword>Heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>Immune modulation</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal stromal cells</keyword><keyword>Single-cell RNA sequencing</keyword><keyword>cell</keyword><keyword>heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>immune modulation</keyword><keyword>mesenchymal stromal cells</keyword><keyword>single-cell rna sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy</publisher><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13287-020-02043-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Single-cell RNA sequencing of equine mesenchymal stromal cells from primary donor-matched tissue sources reveals functional heterogeneity in immune modulation and cell motility.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13287-020-02043-5</url></web-urls></urls><label>Invasion;Migration</label><abstract>Background The efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy is thought to depend on the intrinsic heterogeneity of MSC cultures isolated from different tissue sources as well as individual MSCs isolated from the same tissue source, neither of which is well understood. To study this, we used MSC cultures isolated from horses. The horse is recognized as a physiologically relevant large animal model appropriate for translational MSC studies. Moreover, due to its large size the horse allows for the simultaneous collection of adequate samples from multiple tissues of the same animal, and thus, for the unique collection of donor matched MSC cultures from different sources. The latter is much more challenging in mice and humans due to body size and ethical constraints, respectively. Methods In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on primary equine MSCs that were collected from three donor-matched tissue sources; adipose tissue (AT), bone marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PB). Based on transcriptional differences detected with scRNA-seq, we performed functional experiments to examine motility and immune regulatory function in distinct MSC populations. Results We observed both inter- and intra-source heterogeneity across the three sources of equine MSCs. Functional experiments demonstrated that transcriptional differences correspond with phenotypic variance in cellular motility and immune regulatory function. Specifically, we found that (i) differential expression of junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) between MSC cultures from the three donor-matched tissue sources translated into altered cell motility of BM-derived MSCs when RNA interference was used to knock down this gene, and (ii) differences in C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (CXCL6) expression in clonal MSC lines derived from the same tissue source correlated with the chemoattractive capacity of PB-derived MSCs. Conclusions Ultimately, these findings will enhance our understanding of MSC heterogeneity and will lead to improvements in the therapeutic potential of MSCs, accelerating the transition from bench to bedside.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>John, A</author><author>Günes, C</author><author>Bolenz, C</author><author>Bauer, A T</author><author>Schneider, S W</author><author>Gorzelanny, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bladder cancer-derived interleukin-1 converts the vascular endothelium into a surface</title><secondary-title>BMC cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1178</issue><keywords><keyword>Coagulation</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Tumour microenvironment</keyword><keyword>coagulation</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>tumour microenvironment</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand factor</keyword><keyword>von willebrand factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>BMC Cancer</publisher><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12885-020-07548-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bladder cancer-derived interleukin-1 converts the vascular endothelium into a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory surface.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12885-020-07548-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background Bladder cancer cells orchestrate tumour progression by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines modulate the local tumour microenvironment and increase the susceptibility of tumour distant tissues for metastasis. Here, we investigated the impact of human bladder cancer cell derived factors on the ability to modulate and activate human vascular endothelial cells. Methods The pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory potential of four different bladder cancer cell lines was accessed by qRT-PCR arrays and ELISA. Modulation and activation of endothelial cells was studied in microfluidic devices. Clinical relevance of our findings was confirmed by immune histology in tissue samples of bladder cancer patients and public transcriptome data. Results The unbalanced ratio between interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the secretome of bladder cancer cells converted the quiescent vascular endothelium into a pro-adhesive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-coagulatory surface. Microfluidic experiments showed that tumour cell induced endothelial cell activation promoted leukocyte recruitment and platelet adhesion. Human bladder cancer tissue analysis confirmed that loss of IL-1ra and elevated IL-1 expression was associated with enhanced cancer progression. Conclusions Our data indicate that IL-1 and IL-1ra were dysregulated in bladder cancer and could facilitate tumour dissemination through endothelial cell activation. Targeting the IL-1/IL-1ra axis might attenuate tumour-mediated inflammation and metastasis formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Changmin</author><author>Jeong, Wooseong</author><author>Ghang, Byeongzu</author><author>Park, Yonggeun</author><author>Cho, Moonjae</author><author>Kim, Jinseok</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CYR61 synthesis is Induced by Interleukin-6 and Promotes Migration and Invasion of Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title><secondary-title>Arthritis Res Ther</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arthritis Res Ther</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>22</volume><keywords><keyword>Cyr61</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-6</keyword><keyword>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</keyword><keyword>fibroblast-like synoviocyte</keyword><keyword>rheumatoid arthritis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy</publisher><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13075-020-02369-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cyr61 synthesis is induced by interleukin-6 and promotes migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13075-020-02369-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Proliferation</label><abstract>Background Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is involved in fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) activation and promotes pannus formation and bone and cartilage destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) protein regulates cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Cyr61 in RA-FLS migration and invasion after IL-6 stimulation. Methods Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and real time-polymerase chain reaction were used to examine protein and mRNA levels of Cyr61, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other signalling proteins. Knockdown of gene expression was performed with siRNA, and RNA sequencing was performed for differential gene analysis. Migration and invasion were assessed by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. Results Cyr61 levels were elevated in FLSs from RA patients compared to those in osteoarthritis patients. Control and IL-6-treated FLSs showed differential gene expression. IL-6 stimulated protein synthesis of Cyr61, which was attenuated by the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) inhibitor, PD98059, and knockdown of early growth response 3 (EGR3), but not of JUN. IL-6-induced Cyr61 protein synthesis increased expression of MMP2. Cyr61 promoted FLS migration and invasion in an autocrine manner. Knockdown of CYR61 and a neutralising antibody attenuated Cyr61 synthesis and IL-6-induced FLS migration. Conclusions By modulating the ERK/EGR3 pathway, IL-6 stimulated Cyr61 production and in turn increased invasiveness of FLS. Our data suggest that Cyr61 might be a potential target to prevent the progression of joint damage in RA.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nickol, Michaela E.</author><author>Lyle, Sarah M.</author><author>Dennehy, Brendan</author><author>Kindrachuk, Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dysregulated Host Responses Underlie 2009 Pandemic Influenza-Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Coinfection Pathogenesis at the Alveolar-Capillary Barrier</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>2472</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>alveolar-capillary barrier</keyword><keyword>coinfection</keyword><keyword>influenza</keyword><keyword>kinome</keyword><keyword>staphylococcus aureus</keyword><keyword>virulence factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells9112472</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dysregulated Host Responses Underlie 2009 Pandemic Influenza-Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Coinfection Pathogenesis at the Alveolar-Capillary Barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells9112472</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;TEER24;Virology</label><abstract>nfluenza viruses are a continual public health concern resulting in 3–5 million severe infections annually despite intense vaccination campaigns and messaging. Secondary bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, result in increased morbidity and mortality during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. While coinfections can result in deleterious pathologic consequences, including alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have characterized host- and pathogen-centric mechanisms contributing to influenza-bacterial coinfections in a primary cell coculture model of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Using 2009 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), we demonstrate that coinfection resulted in dysregulated barrier function. Preinfection with pH1N1 resulted in modulation of adhesion- and invasion-associated MRSA virulence factors during lag phase bacterial replication. Host response modulation in coinfected alveolar epithelial cells were primarily related to TLR- and inflammatory response-mediated cell signaling events. While less extensive in cocultured endothelial cells, coinfection resulted in changes to cellular stress response- and TLR-related signaling events. Analysis of cytokine expression suggested that cytokine secretion might play an important role in coinfection pathogenesis. Taken together, we demonstrate that coinfection pathogenesis is related to complex host- and pathogen-mediated events impacting both epithelial and endothelial cell regulation at the alveolar-capillary barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parodi‐Rullán, Rebecca</author><author>Ghiso, Jorge</author><author>Cabrera, Erwin</author><author>Rostagno, Agueda</author><author>Fossati, Silvia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alzheimer’s amyloid β heterogeneous species differentially affect brain endothelial cell viability, blood‐brain barrier integrity, and angiogenesis</title><secondary-title>Aging Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aging Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><issue>July</issue><keywords><keyword>department of pathology</keyword><keyword>new york</keyword><keyword>university school of medicine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33155752</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/acel.13258</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Alzheimer’s amyloid β heterogeneous species differentially affect brain endothelial cell viability, blood‐brain barrier integrity, and angiogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Facel.13258</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Impaired clearance in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain is key in the formation of Aβ parenchymal plaques and cerebrovascular deposits known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), present in &gt;80% of AD patients and ~50% of non‐AD elderly subjects. Aβ deposits are highly heterogeneous, containing multiple fragments mostly derived from catabolism of Aβ40/Aβ42, which exhibit dissimilar aggregation properties. Remarkably, the role of these physiologically relevant Aβ species in cerebrovascular injury and their impact in vascular pathology is unknown. We sought to understand how heterogeneous Aβ species affect cerebral endothelial health and assess whether their diverse effects are associated with the peptides aggregation propensities. We analyzed cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) viability, blood‐brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and angiogenesis, all relevant aspects of brain microvascular dysfunction. We found that Aβ peptides and fragments exerted differential effects on cerebrovascular pathology. Peptides forming mostly oligomeric structures induced CMEC apoptosis, whereas fibrillar aggregates increased BBB permeability without apoptotic effects. Interestingly, all Aβ species tested inhibited angiogenesis in vitro. These data link the biological effects of the heterogeneous Aβ peptides to their primary structure and aggregation, strongly suggesting that the composition of amyloid deposits influences clinical aspects of the AD vascular pathology. As the presence of predominant oligomeric structures in proximity of the vessel walls may lead to CMEC death and induction of microhemorrhages, fibrillar amyloid is likely responsible for increased BBB permeability and associated neurovascular dysfunction. These results have the potential to unveil more specific therapeutic targets and clarify the multifactorial nature of AD.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Tehyung</author><author>de Oliveira Silva Lautenschlager, Sueli</author><author>Ma, Qiuyue</author><author>Eller, Kathrin</author><author>Pollheimer, Marion Julia</author><author>Lazarin-Bidóia, Danielle</author><author>Nakamura, Celso Vataru</author><author>Anders, Hans Joachim</author><author>Steiger, Stefanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drug Crystal-Related Gastrointestinal Complications Involve Crystal-Induced Release of Neutrophil and Monocyte Extracellular Traps</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>cholestyramine</keyword><keyword>exchange resin</keyword><keyword>extracellular traps</keyword><keyword>intestinal necrosis</keyword><keyword>monocytes</keyword><keyword>neutrophils</keyword><keyword>patiromer</keyword><keyword>polystyrene sulfonate</keyword><keyword>sevelamer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33203124</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells9112481</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Drug Crystal-Related Gastrointestinal Complications Involve Crystal-Induced Release of Neutrophil and Monocyte Extracellular Traps.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Ion-exchange resins are commonly used to manage complications of chronic kidney disease, such as hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Occasionally, these drugs can irritate the gastrointestinal lining and cause life-threatening intestinal necrosis. Currently, the pathophysiology of drug crystal-induced intestinal necrosis is not well understood. We hypothesized that crystals of ion-exchange resins like sevelamer, polystyrene sulfonate, and cholestyramine can trigger the formation of neutrophil and monocyte extracellular traps by contributing to intestinal barrier dysfunction. Light and fluorescence microscopy of the colonic resection specimen from a patient with chronic kidney disease revealed severe intestinal necrosis, ulceration, sevelamer crystals, and inflammation upon oral intake of sevelamer, as well as the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps in proximity to small sevelamer crystals. Indeed, drug crystals reduced metabolic activity and induced barrier dysfunction and cell death in human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, drug crystals triggered the release of neutrophil and monocyte extracellular traps. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that besides other factors including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, drug crystals may further amplify a pre-existing barrier dysfunction and necroinflammation in a crescendo of local intestinal necrosis and systemic inflammation/infection, as occasionally observed in patients on ion-exchange resin therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Wijk, Anne Eva</author><author>Georgakopoulou, Theodosia</author><author>Majolée, Jisca</author><author>van Bezu, Jan S.M.</author><author>van der Stoel, Miesje M.</author><author>van het Hof, Bert J.</author><author>de Vries, Helga E.</author><author>Huveneers, Stephan</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L.</author><author>Bakker, Erik N.T.P.</author><author>van Bavel, Ed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microembolus clearance through angiophagy is an auxiliary mechanism preserving tissue perfusion in the rat brain</title><secondary-title>Acta Neuropathologica Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Neuropathologica Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiophagy</keyword><keyword>Cerebral microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Embolus</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40478-020-01071-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Microembolus clearance through angiophagy is an auxiliary mechanism preserving tissue perfusion in the rat brain.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-020-01071-9</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19</label><abstract>Considering its intolerance to ischemia, it is of critical importance for the brain to efficiently process microvascular occlusions and maintain tissue perfusion. In addition to collateral microvascular flow and enzymatic degradation of emboli, the endothelium has the potential to engulf microparticles and thereby recanalize the vessel, through a process called angiophagy. Here, we set out to study the dynamics of angiophagy in relation to cytoskeletal remodeling in vitro and reperfusion in vivo. We show that polystyrene microspheres and fibrin clots are actively taken up by (brain) endothelial cells in vitro, and chart the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton during this process using live cell imaging. Whereas microspheres were taken up through the formation of a cup structure by the apical endothelial membrane, fibrin clots were completely engulfed by the cells, marked by dense F-actin accumulation surrounding the clot. Both microspheres and fibrin clots were retained in the endothelial cells. Notably, fibrin clots were not degraded intracellularly. Using an in vivo microembolization rat model, in which microparticles are injected into the common carotid artery, we found that microspheres are transported by the endothelium from the microvasculature into the brain parenchyma. Microembolization with microspheres caused temporal opening of the blood–brain barrier and vascular nonperfusion, followed by microsphere extravasation and restoration of vessel perfusion over time. Taken together, angiophagy is accompanied by active cytoskeletal remodeling of the endothelium, and is an effective mechanism to restore perfusion of the occluded microvasculature in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anchan, Akshata</author><author>Martin, Olivia</author><author>Hucklesby, James J.

This was shown using ECIS biosensor technology, which revealed rapid disruption via the paracellular junctions. In this paper, we demonstrate that melanoma cells secrete factors (e.g., cytokines) that weaken the endothelial barrier integrity. Through proteome profiling, we attempt to identify the barrier-disrupting cytokines. Melanoma conditioned media were collected from three New Zealand melanoma lines. ECIS technology was used to assess if the conditioned media disrupted the endothelial barrier independent of the melanoma cells. The melanoma cell secretome was assessed using cytometric bead array (CBA), Luminex immunoassay and multiplex Proteome Profilers, to detect the expression of secretory proteins, which may facilitate metastasis. Finally, ECIS technology was used to assess the direct effects of secreted proteins identified as candidates from the proteome screens. We show that melanoma-conditioned media significantly disrupted the brain endothelial barrier, however, to a much lesser extent than the cells from which they were collected. Cytokine and proteome profiling of the conditioned media showed evidence of high concentrations of approximately 15 secreted proteins (including osteopontin, IL-8, GDF-15, MIF and VEGF). These 15 secreted proteins were expressed variably across the melanoma lines. Surprisingly, the addition of these individually to the brain endothelial cells did not substantially affect the barrier integrity. ANGPTL-4 and TGFβ were also produced by the melanoma cells. Whilst TGFβ-1 had a pronounced effect on the barrier integrity, surprisingly ANGPTL-4 did not. However, its C-terminal fragment did and within a very similar period to the conditioned media, albeit not to the same extent. Herein we show that melanoma cells produce a wide-range of soluble factors at high concentrations, which most likely favour support or survival of the cancer cells. Most of these, except for TGFβ-1 and the C-terminal fragment of ANGPTL-4, did not have an impact on the integrity of the brain endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Yegambaram, Manivannan</author><author>Gross, Christine</author><author>Sun, Xutong</author><author>Lu, Qing</author><author>Wang, Hui</author><author>Wu, Xiaomin</author><author>Kangath, Archana</author><author>Tang, Haiyang</author><author>Aggarwal, Saurabh</author><author>Black, Stephen M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RAC1 nitration at Y32 IS involved in the endothelial barrier disruption associated with lipopolysaccharide-mediated acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>Redox Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Redox Biology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.redox.2020.101794</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.redox.2020.101794</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19</label><abstract>Acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating illness induced by systemic inflammation e.g., sepsis or local lung inflammation e.g., COVID-19 mediated severe pneumonia, has an unacceptably high mortality and has no effective therapy. ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)34. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y32, within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y32, preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y32. As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalick, Laura</author><author>Weidenfeld, Sarah</author><author>Grimmer, Benjamin</author><author>Fatykhova, Diana</author><author>Daniel, Philip</author><author>Behrens, Felix</author><author>Dohmen, Melanie</author><author>Brack, Markus C</author><author>Schulz, Sabrina</author><author>Simmons, Szandor</author><author>Müller-redetzky, Holger</author><author>Suttorp, Norbert</author><author>Kurth, Florian</author><author>Neudecker, Jens</author><author>Toennies, Mario</author><author>Bauer, Torsten T.</author><author>Eggeling, Stephan</author><author>Corman, Victor Max</author><author>Hocke, Andreas C.</author><author>Witzenrath, Martin</author><author>Hippenstiel, Stefan</author><author>Kuebler, Wolfgang M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma mediators in patients with severe COVID-19 cause lung endothelial barrier failure</title><secondary-title>European Respiratory Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Respiratory Journal</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1183%2F13993003.02384-2020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Plasma mediators in patients with severe COVID-19 cause lung endothelial barrier failure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1183%2F13993003.02384-2020</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;COVID-19;Virology</label><abstract>Plasma of COVID-19 patients induces pulmonary microvascular barrier failure which increases with disease severity.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a nonselective cation channel studied in endothelium; however, its role in the lung epithelium remains elusive. Here, we show enhanced IRE in TRPV4-deficient (TRPV4–/–) IPL compared with that of WT controls, indicating a protective role of TRPV4 in maintenance of the alveolar epithelial barrier. By immunohistochemistry, mRNA profiling, and electrophysiological characterization, we detected TRPV4 in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial type I (ATI), and alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells. Genetic ablation of TRPV4 resulted in reduced expression of the water-conducting aquaporin-5 (AQP-5) channel in ATI cells. Migration of TRPV4–/– ATI cells was reduced, and cell barrier function was impaired. Analysis of isolated primary TRPV4–/– ATII cells revealed a reduced expression of surfactant protein C, and the TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A induced increases in current densities only in WT ATII cells. Moreover, TRPV4–/– lungs of adult mice developed significantly larger mean chord lengths and altered lung function compared with WT lungs. Therefore, our data illustrate essential functions of TRPV4 channels in alveolar epithelial cells and in protection from edema formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Chen, Jiaqi</author><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Xiao, Siyu</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circ_2858 helps blood-brain barrier disruption by increasing VEGFA via sponging miR-93-5p during Escherichia coli meningitis</title><secondary-title>Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids</full-title></periodical><pages>708-721</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>December</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.omtn.2020.09.034</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://circ_2858 Helps Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption by Increasing VEGFA via Sponging miR-93-5p during Escherichia coli Meningitis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2020.09.034</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Meningitic Escherichia coli invasion of the host brain can lead to increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs, highly abundant in the brain, that are widely involved in the pathological processes of central nervous system (CNS) disorders; however, whether circRNAs participate in the regulation of BBB permeability during E. coli meningitis remains unknown. Here, we identified a novel circRNA, circ_2858, that was significantly upregulated in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) upon meningitic E. coli infection. We also found that circ_2858 regulated BBB permeability in hBMECs by competitively binding miR-93-5p, thereby inducing the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A and finally resulting in downregulation as well as altered distribution of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5. These findings provide novel insights into the influence of circ_2858 on BBB permeability during the pathogenic process of E. coli meningitis, suggesting potential nucleic acid targets for future prevention and therapy of CNS infection induced by meningitic E. coli.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sári, Zsanett</author><author>Mikó, Edit</author><author>Kovács, Tünde</author><author>Boratkó, Anita</author><author>Ujlaki, Gyula</author><author>Jankó, Laura</author><author>Kiss, Borbála</author><author>Uray, Karen</author><author>Bai, Péter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indoxylsulfate, a metabolite of the microbiome, has cytostatic effects in breast cancer via activation of ahr and pxr receptors and induction of oxidative stress</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Cancer stem cell</keyword><keyword>EMT</keyword><keyword>Indoxylsulfate</keyword><keyword>Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Microbiome</keyword><keyword>Nitrosative stress</keyword><keyword>Oncobiome</keyword><keyword>Oncobiosis</keyword><keyword>Oncometabolism</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers12102915</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Indoxylsulfate, a Metabolite of the Microbiome, Has Cytostatic Effects in Breast Cancer via Activation of AHR and PXR Receptors and Induction of Oxidative Stress.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function</label><abstract>Changes to bacterial metabolite-elicited signaling, in oncobiosis associated with breast cancer, plays a role in facilitating the progression of the disease. We show that indoxyl-sulfate (IS), a tryptophan metabolite, has cytostatic properties in models of breast cancer. IS supplementation, in concentrations corresponding to the human serum reference range, suppressed tumor infiltration to the surrounding tissues and metastasis formation in a murine model of breast cancer. In cellular models, IS suppressed NRF2 and induced iNOS, leading to induction of oxidative and nitrosative stress, and, consequently, reduction of cell proliferation; enhanced oxidative and nitrosative stress are crucial in the subsequent cytostasis. IS also suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition vital for suppressing cellular movement and diapedesis. Furthermore, IS rendered cells hypometabolic, leading to a reduction in aldehyde-dehydrogenase positive cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the pregnane-X receptor using CH223191 and the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor using ketoconazole diminished the IS-elicited effects, suggesting that these receptors were the major receptors of IS in these models. Finally, we showed that increased expression of the human enzymes that form IS (Cyp2E1, Sult1A1, and Sult1A2) is associated with better survival in breast cancer, an effect that is lost in triple negative cases. Taken together, IS, similar to indolepropionic acid (another tryptophan metabolite), has cytostatic properties and higher expression of the metabolic machinery responsible for the formation of IS supports survival in breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stojak, Marta</author><author>Milczarek, Magdalena</author><author>Kurpinska, Anna</author><author>Suraj-Prazmowska, Joanna</author><author>Kaczara, Patrycja</author><author>Wojnar-Lason, Kamila</author><author>Banach, Joanna</author><author>Stachowicz-Suhs, Martyna</author><author>Rossowska, Joanna</author><author>Kalviņš, Ivars</author><author>Wietrzyk, Joanna</author><author>Chlopicki, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein disulphide isomerase a1 is involved in the regulation of breast cancer cell adhesion and transmigration via lung microvascular endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Disulphide exchange</keyword><keyword>Protein disulphide isomerase A1</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers12102850</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Protein Disulphide Isomerase A1 Is Involved in the Regulation of Breast Cancer Cell Adhesion and Transmigration via Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcancers12102850</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Cancer cell cross-talk with the host endothelium plays a crucial role in metastasis, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. We studied the involvement of protein disulphide isomerase A1 (PDIA1) in human breast cancer cell (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) adhesion and transendothelial migration. For comparison, the role of PDIA1 in proliferation, migration, cell cycle and apoptosis was also assessed. Pharmacological inhibitor, bepristat 2a and PDIA1 silencing were used to inhibit PDIA1. Inhibition of PDIA1 by bepristat 2a markedly decreased the adhesion of breast cancer cells to collagen type I, fibronectin and human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells across the endothelial monolayer was also inhibited by bepristat 2a, an effect not associated with changes in ICAM-1 expression or changes in cellular bioenergetics. The silencing of PDIA1 produced less pronounced anti-adhesive effects. However, inhibiting extracellular free thiols by non-penetrating blocker p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonate substantially inhibited adhesion. Using a proteomic approach, we identified that β1 and α2 integrins were the most abundant among all integrins in breast cancer cells as well as in lung microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that integrins could represent a target for PDIA1. In conclusion, extracellular PDIA1 plays a major role in regulating the adhesion of cancer cells and their transendothelial migration, in addition to regulating cell cycle and caspase 3/7 activation by intracellular PDIA1. PDIA1-dependent regulation of cancer–endothelial cell interactions involves disulphide exchange and most likely integrin activation but is not mediated by the regulation of ICAM-1 expression or changes in cellular bioenergetics in breast cancer or endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>García-Ponce, Alexander</author><author>Schuster, Katharina</author><author>Døskeland, Stein Ove</author><author>Reed, Rolf K.</author><author>Curry, Fitz Roy E.</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author><author>Radeva, Mariya Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epac1 Is Crucial for Maintenance of Endothelial Barrier Function through A Mechanism Partly Independent of Rac1</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Epac1</keyword><keyword>Rho GTPases</keyword><keyword>cAMP</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>4989218072701</isbn><accession-num>32992982</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cells9102170</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Epac1 Is Crucial for Maintenance of Endothelial Barrier Function through A Mechanism Partly Independent of Rac1.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Epac1 (exchange protein activated by cAMP) stabilizes the endothelial barrier, but detailed studies are limited by the side effects of pharmacological Epac1 modulators and transient transfections. Here, we compare the key properties of barriers between endothelial cells derived from wild-type (WT) and Epac1-knockout (KO) mice myocardium. We found that KO cell layers, unlike WT layers, had low and cAMP-insensitive trans-endothelial resistance (TER). They also had fragmented VE-cadherin staining despite having augmented cAMP levels and increased protein expression of Rap1, Rac1, RhoA, and VE-cadherin. The simultaneous direct activation of Rac1 and RhoA by CN04 compensated Epac1 loss, since TER was increased. In KO-cells, inhibition of Rac1 activity had no additional effect on TER, suggesting that other mechanisms compensate the inhibition of the Rac1 function to preserve barrier properties. In summary, Epac1 is crucial for baseline and cAMP-mediated barrier stabilization through mechanisms that are at least partially independent of Rac1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klems, Alina</author><author>van Rijssel, Jos</author><author>Ramms, Anne S</author><author>Wild, Raphael</author><author>Hammer, Julia</author><author>Merkel, Melanie</author><author>Derenbach, Laura</author><author>Préau, Laetitia</author><author>Hinkel, Rabea</author><author>Suarez-Martinez, Irina</author><author>Schulte-Merker, Stefan</author><author>Vidal, Ramon</author><author>Sauer, Sascha</author><author>Kivelä, Riikka</author><author>Alitalo, Kari</author><author>Kupatt, Christian</author><author>van Buul, Jaap D</author><author>le Noble, Ferdinand</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The GEF Trio controls endothelial cell size and arterial remodeling downstream of Vegf signaling in both zebrafish and cell models</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>5319</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-020-19008-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The GEF Trio controls endothelial cell size and arterial remodeling downstream of Vegf signaling in both zebrafish and cell models.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19008-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Arterial networks enlarge in response to increase in tissue metabolism to facilitate flow and nutrient delivery.

Here, using zebrafish embryos and endothelial cell models, we describe an alternative, flow independent model, involving enlargement of arterial endothelial cells, which results in the formation of large diameter arteries. Endothelial enlargement requires the GEF1 domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio and activation of Rho-GTPases Rac1 and RhoG in the cell periphery, inducing F-actin cytoskeleton remodeling, myosin based tension at junction regions and focal adhesions.

However, unexpected side effects of cardiovascular nature reported for bardoxolone methyl in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (the BEACON trial) still have not been fully explained. Here, we aimed to characterize the effects of bardoxolone methyl compared with other Nrf2 activators—dimethyl fumarate and L-sulforaphane—on human microvascular endothelium. Endothelial toxicity, bioenergetics, mitochondrial membrane potential, endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, endothelial permeability, Nrf2 expression, and ROS production were assessed in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) incubated for 3 and 24 hours with 100 nM–5 μM of either bardoxolone methyl, dimethyl fumarate, or L-sulforaphane. Three-hour incubation with bardoxolone methyl (100 nM–5 μM), although not toxic to endothelial cells, significantly affected endothelial bioenergetics by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential ( concentrations ≥ 3 μ M ), decreasing spare respiratory capacity ( concentrations ≥ 1 μ M ), and increasing proton leak ( concentrations ≥ 500 nM ), while dimethyl fumarate and L-sulforaphane did not exert such actions. Bardoxolone methyl at concentrations ≥ 3 μ M also decreased cellular viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in the endothelium upon 24-hour incubation. In turn, endothelin-1 decreased permeability in endothelial cells in picomolar range, while bardoxolone methyl decreased ET-1 release and increased endothelial permeability even after short-term (3 hours) incubation. In conclusion, despite that all three Nrf2 activators exerted some beneficial effects on the endothelium, as evidenced by a decrease in ROS production, bardoxolone methyl, the most potent Nrf2 activator among the tested compounds, displayed a distinct endothelial profile of activity comprising detrimental effects on mitochondria and cellular viability and suppression of endothelial ET-1 release possibly interfering with ET-1–dependent local regulation of endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Zhenguo</author><author>Chen, Weiguo</author><author>Moshensky, Alexander</author><author>Shakir, Zaid</author><author>Khan, Raheel</author><author>Crotty Alexander, Laura E.</author><author>Ware, Lorraine B</author><author>Aldaz, C M</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author><author>Machado, Roberto F.</author><author>Singla, Sunit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cigarette Smoke and Nicotine-Containing E-cigarette Vapor Downregulate Lung WWOX Expression Which is Associated with Increased Severity of Murine ARDS</title><secondary-title>Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol.</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>ARDS</keyword><keyword>WWOX</keyword><keyword>cigarette smoke</keyword><keyword>e-cigarettes</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0145oc</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0145oc</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>A history of chronic cigarette smoking is known to increase risk for ARDS, but the corresponding risks associated with chronic e-cigarette use are largely unknown. The chromosomal fragile site gene, WWOX, is highly susceptible to genotoxic stress from environmental exposures, and thus an interesting candidate gene for the study of exposure-related lung disease. Lungs harvested from current versus former/never smokers exhibited a 47% decrease in WWOX mRNA levels. Exposure to nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapor resulted in an average 57% decrease in WWOX mRNA levels relative to vehicle treated controls. In separate studies, endothelial (EC)-specific WWOX KO versus WWOX flox control mice were examined under ARDS-producing conditions. EC WWOX KO mice exhibited significantly greater levels of vascular leak and histologic lung injury. ECs were isolated from digested lungs of untreated EC WWOX KO mice using sorting by flow cytometry for CD31+CD45- cells. These were grown in culture, confirmed to be WWOX-deficient by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and analyzed by electric cell impedance sensing (ECIS) as well as a FITC dextran transwell assay for their barrier properties during MRSA or LPS exposure. WWOX KO ECs demonstrated significantly greater declines in barrier function relative to cells from WWOX flox controls during either MRSA or LPS treatment as measured by both ECIS and the transwell assay. The increased risk for ARDS observed in chronic smokers may be mechanistically linked, at least in part, to lung WWOX downregulation, and this phenomenon may also manifest in the near future in chronic users of e-cigarettes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sári, Zsanett</author><author>Mikó, Edit</author><author>Kovács, Tünde</author><author>Jankó, Laura</author><author>Csonka, Tamás</author><author>Lente, Gréta</author><author>Sebő, Éva</author><author>Tóth, Judit</author><author>Tóth, Dezső</author><author>Árkosy, Péter</author><author>Boratkó, Anita</author><author>Ujlaki, Gyula</author><author>Török, Miklós</author><author>Kovács, Ilona</author><author>Szabó, Judit</author><author>Kiss, Borbála</author><author>Méhes, Gábor</author><author>Goedert, James J.</author><author>Bai, Péter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indolepropionic acid, a metabolite of the microbiome, has cytostatic properties in breast cancer by activating ahr and pxr receptors and inducing oxidative stress</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-27</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>AHR</keyword><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>Indolepropionic acid</keyword><keyword>Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Microbiome</keyword><keyword>Nitrosative stress</keyword><keyword>Oncobiome</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>PXR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers12092411</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Indolepropionic Acid, a Metabolite of the Microbiome, Has Cytostatic Properties in Breast Cancer by Activating AHR and PXR Receptors and Inducing Oxidative Stress.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcancers12092411</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function</label><abstract>Oncobiotic transformation of the gut microbiome may contribute to the risk of breast cancer. Recent studies have provided evidence that the microbiome secretes cytostatic metabolites that inhibit the proliferation, movement, and metastasis formation of cancer cells. In this study, we show that indolepropionic acid (IPA), a bacterial tryptophan metabolite, has cytostatic properties. IPA selectively targeted breast cancer cells, but it had no effects on non-transformed, primary fibroblasts. In cell-based and animal experiments, we showed that IPA supplementation reduced the proportions of cancer stem cells and the proliferation, movement, and metastasis formation of cancer cells. These were achieved through inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inducing oxidative and nitrosative stress, and boosting antitumor immune response. Increased oxidative/nitrosative stress was due to the IPA-mediated downregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and enhanced mitochondrial reactive species production. Increased oxidative/nitrosative stress led to cytostasis and reductions in cancer cell stem-ness. IPA exerted its effects through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) receptors. A higher expression of PXR and AHR supported better survival in human breast cancer patients, highlighting the importance of IPA-elicited pathways in cytostasis in breast cancer. Furthermore, AHR activation and PXR expression related inversely to cancer cell proliferation level and to the stage and grade of the tumor. The fecal microbiome’s capacity for IPA biosynthesis was suppressed in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, especially with stage 0. Bacterial indole biosynthesis showed correlation with lymphocyte infiltration to tumors in humans. Taken together, we found that IPA is a cytostatic bacterial metabolite, the production of which is suppressed in human breast cancer. Bacterial metabolites, among them, IPA, have a pivotal role in regulating the progression but not the initiation of the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Hongyan</author><author>Merfeld-Clauss, Stephanie</author><author>Jawed, Yameena</author><author>March, Keith L.</author><author>Coleman, Michael E.</author><author>Bogatcheva, Natalia V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distinct Factors Secreted by Adipose Stromal Cells Protect the Endothelium From Barrier Dysfunction and Apoptosis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>ASC</keyword><keyword>apoptosis</keyword><keyword>barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>conditioned media</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fcell.2020.584653</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Distinct Factors Secreted by Adipose Stromal Cells Protect the Endothelium From Barrier Dysfunction and Apoptosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>We have shown previously that adipose stromal cell (ASC)-derived conditioned media (CM) limited lung injury, endothelial barrier dysfunction, and apoptosis. Here, we used endothelial hyperpermeability and apoptosis assays to investigate how concentration processes affect endothelium-directed bioactivity of ASC-CM and to gain information on the nature of bioactive factors. Comparison of ASC-CM concentrated with differential molecular weight (MW) cutoff filters showed that endothelial barrier protection depended on the species-specific factors in ASC-CM fractionated with MW &gt; 50 kDa. Known barrier regulators—keratin growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)—were detected in ASC-CM fraction of &gt; 100 kDa. Pretreatment of endothelial monolayers with concentrations of KGF, VEGF, and HGF detected in ASC-CM showed that only KGF and HGF protect the endothelium from barrier dysfunction. Depletion of KGF and HGF from ASC-CM attenuated ASC-CM’s ability to protect the endothelial barrier. In contrast to barrier-protective factors, apoptosis-protective factors fractionated with MW &lt; 3 kDa and were not species-specific. Application of donors of apoptosis-mitigating gases showed that the CO donor carbon monoxide-releasing molecule 2 (CORM2) protected the endothelium from apoptosis, while the H2S donor NaSH did not. Knockdown of CO-generating heme oxygenase 1 in ASC attenuated ASC-CM’s ability to protect the endothelium from apoptosis. We have shown that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced apoptosis in endothelium is c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent, and JNK activation is inhibited by ASC-CM pretreatment of endothelial cells. ASC-CM from heme oxygenase 1-depleted ASC displayed attenuated ability to suppress endothelial JNK activation, suggesting that CO-mediated protection of the endothelium from apoptosis is achieved by the downregulation of the JNK pathway. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the concentration of ASC-CM with low MW cutoff filters significantly reduces its anti-apoptotic activity while preserving its barrier-protective activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szulcek, Robert</author><author>Sanchez-Duffhues, Gonzalo</author><author>Rol, Nina</author><author>Pan, Xiaoke</author><author>Tsonaka, Roula</author><author>Dickhoff, Chris</author><author>Yung, Lai Ming</author><author>Manz, Xue D.</author><author>Kurakula, Kondababu</author><author>Kiełbasa, Szymon M.</author><author>Mei, Hailiang</author><author>Timens, Wim</author><author>Yu, Paul B.</author><author>Bogaard, Harm Jan</author><author>Goumans, Marie José</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exacerbated inflammatory signaling underlies aberrant response to BMP9 in pulmonary arterial hypertension lung endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Angiogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Angiogenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>699-714</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bone morphogenetic protein</keyword><keyword>Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-6</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary hypertension</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer Netherlands</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><accession-num>32813135</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10456-020-09741-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Exacerbated infammatory signaling underlies aberrant response to BMP9 in pulmonary arterial hypertension lung endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-020-09741-x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>Imbalanced transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling are postulated to favor a pathological pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). BMP9 is shown to reinstate BMP receptor type-II (BMPR2) levels and thereby mitigate hemodynamic and vascular abnormalities in several animal models of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Yet, responses of the pulmonary endothelium of PAH patients to BMP9 are unknown. Therefore, we treated primary PAH patient-derived and healthy pulmonary ECs with BMP9 and observed that stimulation induces transient transcriptional signaling associated with the process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). However, solely PAH pulmonary ECs showed signs of a mesenchymal trans-differentiation characterized by a loss of VE-cadherin, induction of transgelin (SM22α), and reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In the PAH cells, a prolonged EndMT signaling was found accompanied by sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory, pro-hypoxic, and pro-apoptotic signaling. Herein we identified interleukin-6 (IL6)-dependent signaling to be the central mediator required for the BMP9-induced phenotypic change in PAH pulmonary ECs. Furthermore, we were able to target the BMP9-induced EndMT process by an IL6 capturing antibody that normalized autocrine IL6 levels, prevented mesenchymal transformation, and maintained a functional EC phenotype in PAH pulmonary ECs. In conclusion, our results show that the BMP9-induced aberrant EndMT in PAH pulmonary ECs is dependent on exacerbated pro-inflammatory signaling mediated through IL6.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buzhdygan, Tetyana P</author><author>DeOre, Brandon J</author><author>Baldwin-Leclair, Abigail</author><author>McGary, Hannah</author><author>Razmpour, Roshanak</author><author>Galie, Peter A</author><author>Potula, Raghava</author><author>Andrews, Allison M</author><author>Ramirez, Servio Heybert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The SARSCoV2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in vitro models of the human blood–brain barrier</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.06.15.150912</pages><volume>146</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>cerebral vascular biology</keyword><keyword>microfluidic chip</keyword><keyword>neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>tissue engineering</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105131</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in-vitro models of the human blood–brain barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.150912</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;COVID-19;Virology</label><abstract>As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding SARS-CoV-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature. Observed effects on the central nervous system includes neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is expressed throughout various caliber vessels in the frontal cortex. Additionally, ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial (hBMVEC) maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis for cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48hr exposure window. However, when the viral spike proteins were introduced into model systems that recapitulate the essential features of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), breach to the barrier was evident in various degrees depending on the spike protein subunit tested. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluid model of the human BBB, a platform that most closely resembles the human physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Subsequent analysis also showed the ability for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cong, Yizi</author><author>Wang, Xingmiao</author><author>Wang, Suxia</author><author>Qiao, Guangdong</author><author>Li, Yalun</author><author>Cao, Jianqiao</author><author>Jiang, Wenguo</author><author>Cui, Yuxin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tim-3 promotes tube formation and decreases tight junction formation in vascular endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Bioscience Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioscience Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>40</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1042%2FBSR20202130</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tim-3 promotes tube formation and decreases tight junction formation in vascular endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1042%2FBSR20202130</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Attachment/Spreading</label><abstract>As a negative immune checkpoint molecule, T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) has been found to serve a crucial role in immune escape and tumour progression. Previous studies have reported that Tim-3 is important to endothelial cells and it has also been demonstrated to be involved in numerous types of human diseases, including melanoma, lymphoma, rickettsial infection and atherosclerosis; however, its exact mechanism of action remains largely unknown. In the present study, Tim-3 was overexpressed in vascular endothelial human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and in vitro assays were used to determine that Tim-3 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation through activating cyclin D1 (CCND1), Ras homolog gene family member A and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Additionally, Tim-3 decreased tight junction (TJ) formation and the transepithelial resistance (TER) of endothelial cells by decreasing the expression levels of TJ protein 2, Occludin and claudin 1 (CLND1). In conclusion, these findings suggested that Tim-3 may exert a positive role in angiogenesis and a negative role in TJ formation in vascular endothelial cells, which may provide novel strategies for the treatment of Tim-3-associated diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harrington, Elizabeth O.</author><author>Braza, Julie</author><author>Shil, Aparna</author><author>Chichger, Havovi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracellular vesicles released from p18 overexpressing pulmonary endothelial cells are barrier protective – potential implications for acute respiratory distress syndrome</title><secondary-title>Pulmonary Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonary Circulation</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>basic science research</keyword><keyword>cell biology</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>pulmonary biology</keyword><keyword>vascular biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/2045894020951759</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Extracellular vesicles released from p18 overexpressing pulmonary endothelial cells are barrier protective – potential implications for acute respiratory distress syndrome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2045894020951759</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The novel endosome protein, p18, and the early endosome GTPase, Rab4, play a significant role in protecting the pulmonary vasculature against permeability associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recently, endothelial-derived extracellular vesicles have been identified to play a key role in the endothelial permeability associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, we investigated the effect of these microparticles, released from endothelial cells overexpressing p18 and Rab4, on pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Endothelial-derived extracellular vesicles isolated from lung microvascular endothelial cells which overexpressed cDNA for wild-type p18 protected a naïve monolayer against lipopolysaccharide-induced permeability. In contrast, endothelial-derived extracellular vesicles from cells overexpressing the non-endosomal binding p18 mutant (p18N39) exerted no protective effect on the endothelial monolayer. Cells overexpressing either dominant active or inactive Rab4 released endothelial-derived extracellular vesicles which had no effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced permeability. miRNA analysis and permeability studies of endothelial-derived extracellular vesicle isolated from wild-type p18-overexpressing cells demonstrates that let-7i-5p, miR-96-5p, and miR-137-3p are endothelial-derived extracellular vesicle cargo which exert protective effects on the pulmonary endothelium. Finally, we observed down-regulation of p18 protein expression in both the lung and endothelium in an in vivo and in vitro model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results demonstrate that endothelial-derived extracellular vesicle released from cells overexpressing p18, but not Rab4, contain miRNA cargo which likely promote a barrier-protective effect on the pulmonary endothelium in settings of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Findings indicate the importance of p18 in the pulmonary vasculature and demonstrate that targeting this protein may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce endothelial permeability associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pluimer, Brock R.</author><author>Colt, Mark</author><author>Zhao, Zhen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>G Protein-Coupled Receptors in the Mammalian Blood-Brain Barrier</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>June</issue><keywords><keyword>G-protein coupled receptors</keyword><keyword>blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>drug development</keyword><keyword>neurodegenerative disease</keyword><keyword>neurovascular unit</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fncel.2020.00139</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://G Protein-Coupled Receptors in the Mammalian Blood-Brain Barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>The mammalian neurovascular unit (NVU) is comprised of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. The NVU is the nexus between the cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS). The central component of the NVU is the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which consists of a monolayer of tightly connected endothelial cells covered by pericytes and further surrounded by astrocytic endfeet. In addition to preventing the diffusion of toxic species into the CNS, the BBB endothelium serves as a dynamic regulatory system facilitating the transport of molecules from the bloodstream to the brain and vis versa. The structural integrity and transport functions of the BBB are maintained, in part, by an orchestra of membrane receptors and transporters including members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we provide an overview of GPCRs known to regulate mammalian BBB structure and function and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways plays a role in various neurodegenerative diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khoury, Mitri K</author><author>Stranz, Amelia R</author><author>Liu, Bo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathophysiology of Aortic Aneurysms: Insights from Animal Studies</title><secondary-title>Cardiol Cardiovasc Med.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cardiol Cardiovasc Med.</full-title></periodical><pages>498-514</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Aortic aneurysm</keyword><keyword>Cell biology</keyword><keyword>Molecular biology</keyword><keyword>Mouse model</keyword><keyword>Pathophysiology</keyword><keyword>Surgery</keyword><keyword>Treatment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>3902264330</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.26502/fccm.92920146.Pathophysiology</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pathophysiology of Aortic Aneurysms Insights from Animal Studies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.26502%2Ffccm.92920146</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>Aortic aneurysms are defined as dilations of the aorta greater than 50 percent.

The development of a number of murine models has allowed in depth studies of various cellular and extracellular components of aneurysm pathophysiology. The identification of key therapeutic targets has resulted in several clinical trials evaluating pharmaceutical candidates to treat aneurysm progression. In this review, we focus on providing recent updates on developments in murine models of aortic aneurysm.

Particularly, emergence of surface engineered nanomaterials offered novel varieties in the daily consumables and healthcare products including therapeutics and diagnostics. However, the nanotoxicity and bioactivity of the nanomaterials upon interaction with biological system has raised critical concerns to individual as well as to the environment. Several biological models including plant and animal sources have been identified to study the toxicity of novel nanomaterials, correlating the physio-chemical properties. Biological interaction of nanomaterials and its mediated physiological functions are studied using conventional cell/molecular biological assays to understand the expression levels of genetic information specific to intra/extra cellular enzymes, cell viability, proliferation and function. However, modern research still demands advanced bioassay methods to screen the acute and chronic effects of nanomaterials at the real-time. In this regard, bioelectrochemical techniques, with the recent advancements in the microelectronics, proved to be capable of providing non-invasive measurement of the nanotoxicity effects (in vivo and in vitro) both at single cellular and multicellular levels. This review attempted to provide a detailed information on the recent advancements made in development of bioassay models and systems for assessing the nanotoxicology. With a short background information on engineered nanomaterials and physiochemical properties specific to consumer application, present review highlights the multiple bioassay models evolved for toxicological studies. Emphasize on multiple mechanisms involved in the cell toxicity and electrochemical probing of the biological interactions, revealing the cytotoxicity were also provided. Limitations in the existing electrochemical techniques and opportunities for the future research focusing the advancement in single molecular and whole cell bioassay has been discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wyman, Anne E.</author><author>Nguyen, Trang T.T.</author><author>Karki, Pratap</author><author>Tulapurkar, Mohan E.</author><author>Zhang, Chen Ou</author><author>Kim, Junghyun</author><author>Feng, Theresa G.</author><author>Dabo, Abdoulaye J.</author><author>Todd, Nevins W.</author><author>Luzina, Irina G.</author><author>Geraghty, Patrick</author><author>Foronjy, Robert F.</author><author>Hasday, Jeffrey D.</author><author>Birukova, Anna A.</author><author>Atamas, Sergei P.</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SIRT7 deficiency suppresses inflammation, induces EndoMT, and increases vascular permeability in primary pulmonary endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group UK</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><accession-num>32719338</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-69236-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SIRT7 deficiency suppresses inflammation, induces EndoMT, and increases vascular permeability in primary pulmonary endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69236-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Acute lung injury (ALI), a common condition in critically ill patients, has limited treatments and high mortality. Aging is a risk factor for ALI. Sirtuins (SIRTs), central regulators of the aging process, decrease during normal aging and in aging-related diseases. We recently showed decreased SIRT7 expression in lung tissues and fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis compared to controls. To gain insight into aging-related mechanisms in ALI, we investigated the effects of SIRT7 depletion on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and endothelial barrier permeability in human primary pulmonary endothelial cells. Silencing SIRT7 in pulmonary artery or microvascular endothelial cells attenuated LPS-induced increases in ICAM1, VCAM1, IL8, and IL6 and induced endomesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with decreases in VE-Cadherin and PECAM1 and increases in collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, TGFβ receptor 1, and the transcription factor Snail. Loss of endothelial adhesion molecules was accompanied by increased F-actin stress fibers and increased endothelial barrier permeability. Together, these results show that an aging phenotype induced by SIRT7 deficiency promotes EndoMT with impaired inflammatory responses and dysfunction of the lung vascular barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Castellan, Raphael F.P.</author><author>Vitiello, Milena</author><author>Vidmar, Martina</author><author>Johnstone, Steven</author><author>Iacobazzi, Dominga</author><author>Mellis, David</author><author>Cathcart, Benjamin</author><author>Thomson, Adrian</author><author>Ruhrberg, Christiana</author><author>Caputo, Massimo</author><author>Newby, David E.</author><author>Gray, Gillian A.</author><author>Baker, Andrew H.</author><author>Caporali, Andrea</author><author>Meloni, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-96 and miR-183 differentially regulate neonatal and adult postinfarct neovascularization</title><secondary-title>JCI Insight</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JCI Insight</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32544097</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/JCI.INSIGHT.134888</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://miR-96 and miR-183 differentially regulate neonatal and adult postinfarct neovascularization.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Following myocardial infarction (MI), the adult heart has minimal regenerative potential. Conversely, the neonatal heart can undergo extensive regeneration, and neovascularization capacity was hypothesized to contribute to this difference. Here, we demonstrate the higher angiogenic potential of neonatal compared with adult mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCECs) in vitro and use this difference to identify candidate microRNAs (miRs) regulating cardiac angiogenesis after MI. miR expression profiling revealed miR-96 and miR-183 upregulation in adult compared with neonatal MCECs. Their overexpression decreased the angiogenic potential of neonatal MCECs in vitro and prevented scar resolution and neovascularization in neonatal mice after MI. Inversely, their inhibition improved the angiogenic potential of adult MCECs, and miR-96/miR-183–KO mice had increased peri-infarct neovascularization. In silico analyses identified anillin (ANLN) as a direct target of miR-96 and miR-183. In agreement, Anln expression declined following their overexpression and increased after their inhibition in vitro. Moreover, ANLN expression inversely correlated with miR-96 expression and age in cardiac ECs of cardiovascular patients. In vivo, ANLN+ vessels were enriched in the peri-infarct area of miR-96/miR-183–KO mice. These findings identify miR-96 and miR-183 as regulators of neovascularization following MI and miR-regulated genes, such as anillin, as potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kooij, Gijs</author><author>Troletti, Claudio Derada</author><author>Leuti, Alessandro</author><author>Norris, Paul C.</author><author>Riley, Ian</author><author>Albanese, Maria</author><author>Ruggieri, Serena</author><author>Libreros, Stephania</author><author>van der Pol, Susanne M.A.</author><author>van het Hof, Bert</author><author>Schell, Yoëlle</author><author>Guerrera, Gisella</author><author>Buttari, Fabio</author><author>Mercuri, Nicola Biagio</author><author>Centonze, Diego</author><author>Gasperini, Claudio</author><author>Battistini, Luca</author><author>de Vries, Helga E.</author><author>Serhan, Charles N.</author><author>Chiurchiù, Valerio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Specialized differentially pro-resolving altered in peripheral lipid mediators blood of are patients with multiple sclerosis and attenuate monocyte and blood-brain barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Haematologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Haematologica</full-title></periodical><pages>2056-2070</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31780628</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3324/haematol.2019.219519</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators are differentially altered in peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and attenuate monocyte and blood-brain barrier dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Chronic inflammation is a key pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and suggests that resolution of inflammation, orchestrated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (LM), is impaired. Here, through targeted-metabololipidomics in peripheral blood of patients with MS, we revealed that each disease form was associated with distinct LM profiles that significantly correlated with disease severity. In particular, relapsing and progressive MS patients were associated with high eicosanoids levels, whereas the majority of pro-resolving LM were significantly reduced or below limits of detection and correlated with disease progression. Furthermore, we found impaired expression of several pro-resolving LM biosynthetic enzymes and receptors in blood-derived leukocytes of MS patients. Mechanistically, differentially expressed mediators like LXA4, LXB4, RvD1 and PD1 reduced MS-derived monocyte activation and cytokine production, and inhibited inflammation-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction and monocyte transendothelial migration. Altogether, these findings reveal peripheral defects in the resolution pathway in MS, suggesting pro-resolving LM as novel diagnostic biomarkers and potentially safe therapeutics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rezaei, Maryam</author><author>Martins Cavaco, Ana C.</author><author>Stehling, Martin</author><author>Nottebaum, Astrid</author><author>Brockhaus, Katrin</author><author>Caliandro, Michele F.</author><author>Schelhaas, Sonja</author><author>Schmalbein, Felix</author><author>Vestweber, Dietmar</author><author>Eble, Johannes A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracellular vesicle transfer from endothelial cells drives ve-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells, thereby causing heterotypic cell contacts</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-25</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Cadherin switching</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</keyword><keyword>Extracellular vesicles (EVs)</keyword><keyword>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)</keyword><keyword>Invasion</keyword><keyword>Vascular mimicry (VM)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers12082138</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Extracellular Vesicle Transfer from Endothelial Cells Drives VE-Cadherin Expression in Breast Cancer Cells, Thereby Causing Heterotypic Cell Contacts.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Cadherins mediate cohesive contacts between isotypic cells by homophilic interaction and prevent contact between heterotypic cells. Breast cancer cells neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) atypically express vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. To understand this EC-induced VE-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing different endogenous cadherins were co-cultured with ECs and analyzed for VE-cadherin at the transcriptional level and by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. After losing their endogenous cadherins and neo-expression of VE-cadherin, these cells integrated into an EC monolayer without compromising the barrier function instantly. However, they induced the death of nearby ECs. EC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contained soluble and membrane-anchored forms of VE-cadherin. Only the latter was re-utilized by the cancer cells. In a reporter gene assay, EC-adjacent cancer cells also showed a juxtacrine but no paracrine activation of the endogenous VE-cadherin gene. This cadherin switch enabled intimate contact between cancer and endothelial cells in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane tumor model showing vasculogenic mimicry (VM). This EV-mediated, EC-induced cadherin switch in breast cancer cells and the neo-expression of VE-cadherin mechanistically explain the mutual communication in the tumor microenvironment. Hence, it may be a target to tackle VM, which is often found in breast cancers of poor prognosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Idowu, Temitayo O.</author><author>Etzrodt, Valerie</author><author>Seeliger, Benjamin</author><author>Bolanos-Palmieri, Patricia</author><author>Thamm, Kristina</author><author>Haller, Hermann</author><author>David, Sascha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of specific tie2 cleavage sites and therapeutic modulation in experimental sepsis</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32838837</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/ELIFE.59520</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Identification of specific Tie2 cleavage sites and therapeutic modulation in experimental sepsis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Endothelial Tie2 signaling plays a pivotal role in vascular barrier maintenance at baseline and after injury. We previously demonstrated that a sharp drop in Tie2 expression observed across various murine models of critical illnesses is associated with increased vascular permeability and mortality. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain shedding has recently been recognized as a possible mechanism for Tie2 downregulation in sepsis. Here, we identified the exact MMP14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain cleavage sites and could show that pharmacological MMP14 blockade in experimental murine sepsis exerts barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects predominantly through the attenuation of Tie2 cleavage to improve survival both in a pre-treatment and rescue approach.

ARDS is also one of the major triggers of mortality associated with coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19). We used a mouse model of ARDS induced by Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), which triggers 100% mortality, to investigate the mechanisms through which Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) attenuates ARDS. SEB was used to trigger ARDS in C3H mice. These mice were treated with THC and analyzed for survival, ARDS, cytokine storm, and metabolome. Additionally, cells isolated from the lungs were used to perform single-cell RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis. A database analysis of human COVID-19 patients was also performed to compare the signaling pathways with SEB-mediated ARDS. The treatment of SEB-mediated ARDS mice with THC led to a 100% survival, decreased lung inflammation, and the suppression of cytokine storm. This was associated with immune cell apoptosis involving the mitochondrial pathway, as suggested by single-cell RNA sequencing. A transcriptomic analysis of immune cells from the lungs revealed an increase in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes following THC treatment. In addition, metabolomic analysis revealed elevated serum concentrations of amino acids, lysine, n-acetyl methionine, carnitine, and propionyl L-carnitine in THC-treated mice. THC caused the downregulation of miR-185, which correlated with an increase in the pro-apoptotic gene targets. Interestingly, the gene expression datasets from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of human COVID-19 patients showed some similarities between cytokine and apoptotic genes with SEB-induced ARDS. Collectively, this study suggests that the activation of cannabinoid receptors may serve as a therapeutic modality to treat ARDS associated with COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Villalba, Nuria</author><author>Baby, Sheon</author><author>Cha, Byeong J.</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Site-specific opening of the blood-brain barrier by extracellular histones</title><secondary-title>Journal of neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>281</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>Endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>Histones</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Journal of Neuroinflammation</publisher><isbn>1297402001950</isbn><accession-num>32962721</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12974-020-01950-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Site-specific opening of the blood-brain barrier by extracellular histones.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Increased extracellular histones in the bloodstream are known as a biomarker for vascular dysfunction associated with severe trauma or sepsis. There is limited information regarding the pathogenic role of circulating histones in neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular endothelial injury. Particularly, it remains unclear whether histones affect the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability function. METHODS: The direct effects of unfractionated histones on endothelial barrier properties were first assessed in brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance and solute flux. This was followed by in vivo mouse experiments, where BBB function was assessed by quantifying brain tissue accumulation of intravenously injected tracers of different molecular sizes, and comparison was made in mice receiving a sublethal dose of histones versus sterile saline. In parallel, the endothelial barrier ultrastructure was examined in histone- and saline-injected animals under transmission electron microscopy, corresponding to the expression of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. RESULTS: Histones increased paracellular permeability to sodium fluorescein and reduced barrier resistance at 100 μg/mL; these responses were accompanied by discontinuous staining of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and zona ocludens-1. Interestingly, the effects of histones did not seem to result from cytotoxicity, as evidenced by negative propidium iodide staining. In vivo, histones increased the paracellular permeability of the BBB to small tracers of &lt; 1-kDa, whereas tracers larger than 3-kDa remained impermeable across brain microvessels. Further analysis of different brain regions showed that histone-induced tracer leakage and loss of tight junction protein expression mainly occurred in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebral cortex. Consistently, opening of tight junctions was found in hippocampal capillaries from histone-injected animals. Protein expression levels of GFAP and iBA1 remained unchanged in histone-injected mice indicating that histones did not affect reactive gliosis. Moreover, cell membrane surface charge alterations are involved in histone-induced barrier dysfunction and tight junction disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular histones cause a reversible, region-specific increase in BBB permeability to small molecules by disrupting tight junctions in the hippocampus. We suggest that circulating histones may contribute to cerebrovascular injury or brain dysfunction by altering BBB structure and function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Yonggang</author><author>Zabell, Taylor</author><author>Creasy, Alexandra</author><author>Yang, Xiaoyuan</author><author>Chatterjee, Victor</author><author>Villalba, Nuria</author><author>Kistler, Erik B.</author><author>Wu, Mack H.</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gut Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Induces Lung Inflammation via Mesenteric Lymph-Mediated Neutrophil Activation</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>inflammation</keyword><keyword>intestinal ischemia</keyword><keyword>intestinal ischemia/reperfusion</keyword><keyword>mesenteric lymph</keyword><keyword>neutrophils</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>reperfusion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fimmu.2020.586685</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Gut Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Induces Lung Inflammation via Mesenteric Lymph-Mediated Neutrophil Activation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernstein, David L.</author><author>Gajghate, Sachin</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L.</author><author>Winfield, Malika</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author><author>Heldt, Nathan A.</author><author>Rom, Slava</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Let-7G Counteracts Endothelial Dysfunction and Ameliorating Neurological Functions in Mouse Ischemia/Reperfusion Stroke Model</title><secondary-title>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</full-title></periodical><pages>543-555</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>October 2019</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood brain barrier</keyword><keyword>Ischemia/reperfusion</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte infiltration</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword><keyword>microRNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>32017988</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbi.2020.01.026</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://let-7g counteracts endothelial dysfunction and ameliorating neurological functions in mouse ischemiareperfusion stroke model.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.01.026</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Stroke is a debilitating disease, accounting for almost 20% of all hospital visits, and 8% of all fatalities in the United States in 2017. Following an ischemic attack, inflammatory processes originating from endothelial cells within the brain microvasculature can induce many toxic effects into the impacted area, from both sides of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In addition to increased BBB permeability, impacted brain microvascular endothelial cells can recruit macrophages and other immune cells from the periphery and can also trigger the activation of microglia and astrocytes within the brain. We have identified a key microRNA, let-7g, which levels were drastically diminished as consequence of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in vivo and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro ischemia/reperfusion conditions, respectively. We have observed that let-7g* liposome-based delivery is capable of attenuating inflammation after stroke, reducing BBB permeability, limiting brain infiltration by CD3+CD4+ T-cells and Ly6G+ neutrophils, lessening microglia activation and neuronal death. These effects consequently improved clinical outcomes, shown by mitigating post-stroke gait asymmetry and extremity motor function. Due to the role of the endothelium in propagating the effects of stroke and other inflammation, treatments which can reduce endothelial inflammation and limit ischemic damage and improving recovery after a stroke are required. Our findings demonstrate a critical link between the CNS inflammation and the immune system reaction and lay important groundwork for future stroke pharmacotherapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Jinyao</author><author>Huang, Kai</author><author>Xu, Shiqing</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author><author>Wang, Chen</author><author>Cai, Hua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeting NOX4 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via attenuation of redox-sensitive activation of CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK and endothelial cell barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Redox Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Redox Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>101638</pages><volume>36</volume><keywords><keyword>Acute lung injury (ALI)</keyword><keyword>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</keyword><keyword>Endothelial barrier dysfunction</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cell (EC)</keyword><keyword>Endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>NADPH oxidase (NOX)</keyword><keyword>NOX1</keyword><keyword>NOX2</keyword><keyword>NOX4</keyword><keyword>Occludin</keyword><keyword>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)</keyword><keyword>Tight junction</keyword><keyword>ZO-1</keyword><keyword>p22phox</keyword><keyword>p47phox</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>32863203</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.redox.2020.101638</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Targeting NOX4 alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via attenuation of redox-sensitive activation of CaMKIIERK12MLCK and endothelial cell barrier dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101638</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Increased pulmonary vascular permeability due to endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction is a major pathological feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI), which is a devastating critical illness with high incidence and excessive mortality. Activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) induces EC dysfunction via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role(s) of NOX isoform(s), and their downstream signaling events, in the development of ARDS/ALI have remained unclear. Cecal Ligation Puncture (CLP) was used to induce preclinical septic ALI in wild-type mice and mice deficient in NOX2 or p47phox, or mice transfected of control siRNA, NOX1 or NOX4 siRNA in vivo. The survival rate of the CLP group at 24 h (26.6%, control siRNA treated) was substantially improved by NOX4 knockdown (52.9%). Mice lacking NOX2 or p47phox, however, had worse outcomes after CLP (survival rates at 0% and 8.3% respectively), whereas NOX1-silenced mice had similar survival rate (30%). NOX4 knockdown attenuated lung ROS production in septic mice, whereas NOX1 knockdown, NOX2 knockout, or p47phox knockout in mice had no effects. In addition, NOX4 knockdown attenuated redox-sensitive activation of the CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK pathway, and restored expression of EC tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin to maintain EC barrier integrity. Correspondingly, NOX4 knockdown in cultured human lung microvascular ECs also reduced LPS-induced ROS production, CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK activation and EC barrier dysfunction. Scavenging superoxide in vitro and in vivo with TEMPO, or inhibiting CaMKII activation with KN93, had similar effects as NOX4 knockdown in preserving EC barrier dysfunction. In summary, we have identified a novel, selective and causal role of NOX4 (versus other NOX isoforms) in inducing lung EC barrier dysfunction and injury/mortality in a preclinical CLP-induced septic model, which involves redox-sensitive activation of CaMKII/ERK1/2/MLCK pathway. Targeting NOX4 may therefore prove to an innovative therapeutic option that is markedly effective in treating ALI/ARDS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gerasimenko, Tatiana</author><author>Nikulin, Sergey</author><author>Zakharova, Galina</author><author>Poloznikov, Andrey</author><author>Petrov, Vladimir</author><author>Baranova, Ancha</author><author>Tonevitsky, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance Spectroscopy as a Tool for Monitoring Performance in 3D Models of Epithelial Tissues</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>3D cell culture models</keyword><keyword>TEER</keyword><keyword>barrier tissues</keyword><keyword>epithelium</keyword><keyword>impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>label-free monitoring</keyword><keyword>microfluidic devices</keyword><keyword>organs-on-a-chip</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fbioe.2019.00474</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Impedance Spectroscopy as a Tool for Monitoring Performance in 3D Models of Epithelial Tissues.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Review;TEER24</label><abstract>In contrast to traditional 2D cell cultures, both 3D models and organ-on-a-chip devices allow the study of the physiological responses of human cells. These models reconstruct human tissues in conditions closely resembling the body. Translation of these techniques into practice is hindered by associated labor costs, a need which may be remedied by automation. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a promising, automation-compatible label-free technology allowing to carry out a wide range of measurements both in real-time and as endpoints. IS has been applied to both the barrier cultures and the 3D constructs. Here we provide an overview of the impedance-based analysis in different setups and discuss its utility for organ-on-a-chip devices. Most attractive features of impedance-based assays are their compatibility with high-throughput format and supports for the measurements in real time with high temporal resolution, which allow tracing of the kinetics. As of now, IS-based techniques are not free of limitations, including imperfect understanding of the parameters that have their effects on the impedance, especially in 3D cell models, and relatively high cost of the consumables. Moreover, as the theory of IS stems from electromagnetic theory and is quite complex, work on popularization and explanation of the method for experimental biologists is required. It is expected that overcoming these limitations will lead to eventual establishing IS based systems as a standard for automated management of cell-based experiments in both academic and industry environments.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Qi</author><author>Zhang, Hui</author><author>Bai, Li Ping</author><author>Law, Betty Yuen Kwan</author><author>Xiong, Haoming</author><author>Zhou, Xiaobo</author><author>Xiao, Riping</author><author>Qu, Yuan Qing</author><author>Mok, Simon Wing Fai</author><author>Liu, Liang</author><author>Wong, Vincent Kam Wai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel ginsenoside derivative 20(S)-Rh2E2 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and in vitro via intervention of cancer cell energy metabolism</title><secondary-title>Cell Death and Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Death and Disease</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>32796841</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41419-020-02881-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Novel ginsenoside derivative 20(S)-Rh2E2 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and in vitro via intervention of cancer cell energy metabolism.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-02881-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;TEER24</label><abstract>Increased energy metabolism is responsible for supporting the abnormally upregulated proliferation and biosynthesis of cancer cells. The key cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (α-enolase) have been identified as the targets for active components of ginseng. Accordingly, ginseng or ginsenosides have been demonstrated with their potential values for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer via the regulation of energy balance. Notably, our previous study demonstrated that the R-form derivative of 20(R)-Rh2, 20(R)-Rh2E2 exhibits specific and potent anti-tumor effect via suppression of cancer energy metabolism. However, the uncertain pharmacological effect of S-form derivative, 20(S)-Rh2E2, the by-product during the synthesis of 20(R)-Rh2E2 from parental compound 20(R/S)-Rh2 (with both R- and S-form), retarded the industrialized production, research and development of this novel effective candidate drug. In this study, 20(S)-Rh2E2 was structurally modified from pure 20(S)-Rh2, and this novel compound was directly compared with 20(R)-Rh2E2 for their in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy. Results showed that 20(S)-Rh2E2 effectively inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a lung xenograft mouse model. Most importantly, animal administrated with 20(S)-Rh2E2 up to 320 mg/kg/day survived with no significant body weight lost or observable toxicity upon 7-day treatment. In addition, we revealed that 20(S)-Rh2E2 specifically suppressed cancer cell energy metabolism via the downregulation of metabolic enzyme α-enolase, leading to the reduction of lactate, acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl CoA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC-1), but not normal cells. These findings are consistent to the results obtained from previous studies using a similar isomer 20(R)-Rh2E2. Collectively, current results suggested that 20(R/S)-Rh2E2 isomers could be the new and safe anti-metabolic agents by acting as the tumor metabolic suppressors, which could be generated from 20(R/S)-Rh2 in industrialized scale with low cost.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eldawud, Reem</author><author>Wagner, Alixandra</author><author>Dong, Chenbo</author><author>Gupta, Neha</author><author>Rojanasakul, Yon</author><author>O'Doherty, George</author><author>Stueckle, Todd A.</author><author>Dinu, Cerasela Zoica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential antitumor activity of digitoxin and user-designed analog administered to human lung cancer cells</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - General Subjects</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - General Subjects</full-title></periodical><pages>129683</pages><volume>1864</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Anti-tumor activity</keyword><keyword>Cardiac glycosides</keyword><keyword>Chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>Digitoxin</keyword><keyword>Lung cancer</keyword><keyword>Synthetic analog</keyword><keyword>Therapeutic alternatives</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>32679249</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.129683</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Potential antitumor activity of digitoxin and user-designed analog administered to human lung cancer cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.129683</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Attachment/Spreading;Modeling</label><abstract>Background: Cardiac glycosides (CGs), such as digitoxin, are traditionally used for treatment of congestive heart failure; recently they also gained attention for their anticancer properties. Previous studies showed that digitoxin and a synthetic L-sugar monosaccharide analog treatment decreases cancer cell proliferation, increases apoptosis, and pro-adhesion abilities; however, no reports are available on their potential to alter lung cancer cell cytoskeleton structure and reduce migratory ability. Herein, we investigated the anticancer effects of digitoxin and its analog, digitoxigenin-α-L-rhamnoside (D6MA), to establish whether cytoskeleton reorganization and reduced motility are drug-induced cellular outcomes. Methods: We treated non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLCs) with sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, and toxic concentrations of digitoxin and D6MA respectively, followed by both single point and real-time assays to evaluate changes in cellular gene and protein expression, adhesion, elasticity, and migration. Results: Digitoxin and D6MA induced a decrease in matrix metalloproteinases expression via altered focal adhesion signaling and a suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases / protein kinase B pathway which lead to enhanced adhesion, altered elasticity, and reduced motility of NSCLCs. Global gene expression analysis identified dose-dependent changes to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer, epithelial tumor, and microtubule dynamics signaling. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that digitoxin and D6MA can target antitumor signaling pathways to alter NSCLC cytoskeleton and migratory ability to thus potentially reduce their tumorigenicity. Significance: Discovering signaling pathways that control cancer's cell phenotype and how such pathways are affected by CG treatment will potentially allow for active usage of synthetic CG analogs as therapeutic agents in advanced lung conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Summers, Megan E.</author><author>Richmond, Bradley W.</author><author>Menon, Swapna</author><author>Sheridan, Ryan M.</author><author>Kropski, Jonathan A.</author><author>Majka, Sarah A.</author><author>Taketo, M.

In these studies, we demonstrate that lung mesenchymal vascular progenitor cells (MVPC) modulate adaptive angiogenesis via lineage trace, depletion of MVPC, and modulation of β-catenin expression. Single cell sequencing confirmed MVPC as multipotential vascular progenitors, thus, genetic depletion resulted in alveolar simplification with reduced adaptive angiogenesis. Following vascular endothelial injury, Wnt activation in MVPC was sufficient to elicit an emphysema-like phenotype characterized by increased MLI, fibrosis, and MVPC driven adaptive angiogenesis. Lastly, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling skewed the profile of human and murine MVPC toward an adaptive phenotype. These data suggest that lung MVPC drive angiogenesis in response to injury and regulate the microvascular niche as well as subsequent distal lung tissue architecture via Wnt signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yi Chen Ethan</author><author>Lee, I.

Compared to standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analytical technology, biosensors provide a strategy to real-time and on-site monitor micro biophysiological signals via a combination of biological, chemical, and physical technologies. This review summarizes the recent and significant advances made in various biosensor technologies for different applications of biological and biomedical interest, especially on tissue engineering applications. Different fabrication techniques utilized for tissue engineering purposes, such as computer numeric control (CNC), photolithographic, casting, and 3D printing technologies are also discussed. Key developments in the cell/tissue-based biosensors, biomolecular sensing strategies, and the expansion of several biochip approaches such as organs-on-chips, paper based-biochips, and flexible biosensors are available. Cell polarity and cell behaviors such as proliferation, differentiation, stimulation response, and metabolism detection are included. Biosensors for diagnosing tissue disease modes such as brain, heart, lung, and liver systems and for bioimaging are discussed. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by current biosensing techniques and highlight future prospects of biosensors for tissue engineering applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mietzner, Raphael</author><author>Kade, Christian</author><author>Froemel, Franziska</author><author>Pauly, Diana</author><author>Stamer, W.

Unfortunately, topically applied ROCK inhibitors suffer from high incidence of hyperemia and low intraocular bioavailability. Therefore, we propose the use of poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres as a depot formulation for intravitreal injection to supply outflow tissues with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil over a prolonged time. Fasudil-loaded microspheres were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. The chemical integrity of released fasudil was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The biological activity was measured in cell-based assays using trabecular meshwork cells (TM cells), Schlemm’s canal cells (SC cells), fibroblasts and adult retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19). Cellular response to fasudil after its diffusion through vitreous humor was investigated by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Microspheres ranged in size from 3 to 67 µm. The release of fasudil from microspheres was controllable and sustained for up to 45 days. Released fasudil reduced actin stress fibers in TM cells, SC cells and fibroblasts. Decreased collagen gel contraction provoked by fasudil was detected in TM cells (~2.4-fold), SC cells (~1.4-fold) and fibroblasts (~1.3-fold). In addition, fasudil readily diffused through vitreous humor reaching its target compartment and eliciting effects on TM cells. No negative effects on ARPE-19 cells were observed. Since fasudil readily diffuses through the vitreous humor, we suggest that an intravitreal drug depot of ROCK inhibitors could significantly improve current glaucoma therapy particularly for patients with comorbid retinal diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anwer, Shaista</author><author>Szaszi, Katalin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring Cell Growth and Junction Development in Epithelial Cells Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)</title><secondary-title>bio-protocol</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bio-protocol</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3729</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3729</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Proliferation;Theory</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soe, Hui Jen</author><author>Manikam, Rishya</author><author>Raju, Chandramathi Samudi</author><author>Khan, Mohammad Asif</author><author>Devi, Shamala</author><author>Id, Sekaran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correlation of host inflammatory cytokines and immune-related metabolites , but not viral NS1 protein , with disease severity of dengue virus infection</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><volume>15</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0237141</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Correlation of host inflammatory cytokines and immune-related metabolites, but not viral NS1 protein, with disease severity of dengue virus infection.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237141</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Virology</label><abstract>Severe dengue can be lethal caused by manifestations such as severe bleeding, fluid accumulation and organ impairment. This study aimed to investigate the role of dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and host factors contributing to severe dengue. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system was used to investigate the changes in barrier function of microvascular endothelial cells treated NS1 protein and serum samples from patients with different disease severity. Cytokines and metabolites profiles were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry respectively. The findings showed that NS1 was able to induce the loss of barrier function in microvascular endothelium in a dose dependent manner, however, the level of NS1 in serum samples did not correlate with the extent of vascular leakage induced. Further assessment of host factors revealed that cytokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20 and CXCL1, as well as adhesion molecule ICAM-1, that are involved in leukocytes infiltration were expressed higher in dengue patients in comparison to healthy individuals. In addition, metabolomics study revealed the presence of deregulated metabolites involved in the phospholipid metabolism pathway in patients with severe manifestations. In conclusion, disease severity in dengue virus infection did not correlate directly with NS1 level, but instead with host factors that are involved in the regulation of junctional integrity and phospholipid metabolism. However, as the studied population was relatively small in this study, these exploratory findings should be confirmed by expanding the sample size using an independent cohort to further establish the significance of this study.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roudnicky, Filip</author><author>Kim, Bo Kyoung</author><author>Lan, Yanjun</author><author>Schmucki, Roland</author><author>Küppers, Verena</author><author>Christensen, Klaus</author><author>Graf, Martin</author><author>Patsch, Christoph</author><author>Burcin, Mark</author><author>Meyer, Claas Aiko</author><author>Westenskow, Peter D.</author><author>Cowan, Chad A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a combination of transcription factors that synergistically increases endothelial cell barrier resistance</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>4159802060</isbn><accession-num>32127614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-60688-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Identification of a combination of transcription factors that synergistically increases endothelial cell barrier resistance.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Endothelial cells (ECs) display remarkable plasticity during development before becoming quiescent and functionally mature. EC maturation is directed by several known transcription factors (TFs), but the specific set of TFs responsible for promoting high-resistance barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), have not yet been fully defined. Using expression mRNA data from published studies on ex vivo ECs from the central nervous system (CNS), we predicted TFs that induce high-resistance barrier properties of ECs as in the BBB. We used our previously established method to generate ECs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and then we overexpressed the candidate TFs in hPSC-ECs and measured barrier resistance and integrity using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, trans-endothelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran permeability assays. SOX18 and TAL1 were the strongest EC barrier-inducing TFs, upregulating Wnt-related signaling and EC junctional gene expression, respectively, and downregulating EC proliferation-related genes. These TFs were combined with SOX7 and ETS1 that together effectively induced EC barrier resistance, decreased paracellular transport and increased protein expression of tight junctions and induce mRNA expression of several genes involved in the formation of EC barrier and transport. Our data shows identification of a transcriptional network that controls barrier resistance in ECs. Collectively this data may lead to novel approaches for generation of in vitro models of the BBB.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Josephine Mathilde Elisabeth</author><author>van der Stoel, Miesje Maxime</author><author>van den Berg, Marlene</author><author>van Loon, Nienke Marlies</author><author>Moeton, Martina</author><author>Scholl, Edwin</author><author>van der Wel, Nicole Neeltje</author><author>Kovačević, Igor</author><author>Hordijk, Peter Lodewijk</author><author>Loregger, Anke</author><author>Huveneers, Stephan</author><author>Zelcer, Noam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>32</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>MARCH6</keyword><keyword>MARCHF6</keyword><keyword>SQLE</keyword><keyword>VE-cadherin</keyword><keyword>adherens junction</keyword><keyword>angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>cholesterol metabolism</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>membrane organization</keyword><keyword>post-transcriptional regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107944</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The MARCH6-SQLE Axis Controls Endothelial Cholesterol Homeostasis and Angiogenic Sprouting.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Tan et al. identify the E3-ligase MARCH6 as an important regulator of endothelial sprouting angiogenesis, owing to its ability to degrade the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme SQLE.

In this study, an impedance sensing system is used to measure and characterize real-time changes in electric impedance (resistance and capacitance) with respect to an alternating current (AC) applied to HaCAT and A431 cell colonies. The impedance data is related to the properties of cell spreading, attachment, and delamination. The effect of reishi at dosages of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 mg/ml on these cellular properties was inferred from impedance data. The initial impedance data show that resistance is greater for A431 cells than HaCAT cells and that capacitance for A431 cells is less than the capacitance for HaCAT cells. Further, the data shows the resistance for HaCAT cells and for A431 cells increases with time, and the capacitance for both decreases with time. The impedance data analysis shows that reishi plays no role in altering the impedance of the cellular matrix. At most, reishi serves as a lubricant to allow partial detachment and reattachment of HaCAT cell-to-cell bonds, thus reordering (&lt; entropy) the cellular matrix. This effect is not seen in A431 cell colonies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ibrahim, Ahmed S</author><author>Hussein, Khaled</author><author>Wang, Fang</author><author>Wan, Ming</author><author>Saad, Nancy</author><author>Essa, Maamon</author><author>Kim, Ivana</author><author>Shakoor, Akbar</author><author>Owen, Leah A</author><author>DeAngelis, Margaret M</author><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) 4 But Not BMP2 Disrupts the Barrier Integrity of Retinal Pigment Epithelia and Induces Their Migration : A Potential Role in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072293</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)4 But Not BMP2 Disrupts the Barrier Integrity of Retinal Pigment Epithelia and Induces Their Migration A Potential Role in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072293</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Disruption of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) barrier integrity and RPE migration are hallmark features in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), but the underlying causes and pathophysiology are not completely well-defined. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) on the barrier function and migration of RPE. In particular, we investigated the role of BMP2 and BMP4 in these processes as our analysis of RNA-sequencing (seq) data from human donor eyes demonstrated that they are highly differentially expressed BMP members in macular RPE/choroid versus macular retina. We used electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system to monitor precisely in real time the barrier integrity and migration of ARPE-19 after treatment with various concentrations of BMP2 or BMP4. Immunofluorescence was also used to assess the changes in the expression and the organization of the key tight junction protein, zona occludens (ZO)-1, in ARPE-19 cells under BMP2 or BMP4 treatment. This was followed by measuring the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Finally, RNA-seq and ELISA were used to determine the local and circulating levels of BMP2 and BMP4 in retinas and serum samples from nAMD donors. Our ECIS results showed that BMP4 but not BMP2 decreased the transcellular electrical resistance (TER) of ARPE-19 and increased their migration in comparison with control (vehicle-treated cells). Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed a disorganization of ZO-1 in BMP4-treated ARPE-19 not in BMP2-treated cells or vehicle-treated controls. This effect of BMP4 was associated with significant increases in the activity of MMPs, specifically MMP2. Lastly, these results were corroborated by additional findings that circulating but not local BMP4 levels were significantly higher in nAMD donor samples compared to controls. Collectively, our results demonstrated unreported effects of BMP4 on inducing RPE dysfunction and suggest that BMP4 but not BMP2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in nAMD.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Id, Lindsay J Bailey-steinitz</author><author>Shih, Ying-hsuan</author><author>Radeke, Monte J</author><author>Coffey, Pete J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An in vitro model of chronic wounding and its implication for age-related macular degeneration</title><secondary-title>PLOS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0236298</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://An in vitro model of chronic wounding and its implication for age-related macular degeneration.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236298</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a central role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Throughout life, RPE cells are challenged by a variety of cytotoxic stressors, some of which are cumulative with age and may ultimately contribute to drusen and lipofuscin accumulation. Stressors such as these continually damage RPE cells resulting in a state of chronic wounding. Current cell-based platforms that model a state of chronic RPE cell wounding are limited, and the RPE cellular response is not entirely understood. Here, we used the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system to induce a state of acute or chronic wounding on differentiated human fetal RPE cells to analyze changes in the wound repair response. RPE cells surrounding the lesioned area employ both cell migration and proliferation to repair wounds but fail to reestablish their original cell morphology or density after repetitive wounding. Chronically wounded RPE cells develop phenotypic AMD characteristics such as loss of cuboidal morphology, enlarged size, and multinucleation. Transcriptomic analysis suggests a systemic misregulation of RPE cell functions in bystander cells, which are not directly adjacent to the wound. Genes associated with the major RPE cell functions (LRAT, MITF, RDH11) significantly downregulate after wounding, in addition to differential expression of genes associated with the cell cycle (CDK1, CDC6, CDC20), inflammation (IL-18, CCL2), and apoptosis (FAS). Interestingly, repetitive wounding resulted in prolonged misregulation of genes, including FAS, LRAT, and PEDF. The use of ECIS to induce wounding resulted in an over-representation of AMD-associated genes among those dysregulated genes, particularly genes associated with advanced AMD. This simple system provides a new model for further investigation of RPE cell wound response in AMD pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saddala, Madhu Sudhana</author><author>Lennikov, Anton</author><author>Mukwaya, Anthony</author><author>Yang, Yan</author><author>Hill, Michael A.</author><author>Lagali, Neil</author><author>Huang, Hu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discovery of novel L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers and application for the prevention of inflammation and angiogenesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>L-VGCC</keyword><keyword>Microglia</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Pharmacophore</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>Smooth muscle cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32334630</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12974-020-01801-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Discovery of novel L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers and application for the prevention of inflammation and angiogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>10.1186/s12974-020-01801-9</url></web-urls></urls><label>Calcium Signaling</label><abstract>Background: The ways in which microglia activate and promote neovascularization (NV) are not fully understood. Recent in vivo evidence supports the theory that calcium is required for the transition of microglia from a surveillance state to an active one. The objectives of this study were to discover novel L-type voltage-gated channel (L-VGCC) blockers and investigate their application for the prevention of inflammation and angiogenesis. Methods: Pharmacophore-based computational modeling methods were used to screen for novel calcium channel blockers (CCBs) from the ZINC compound library. The effects of CCBs on calcium blockade, microglial pro-inflammatory activation, and cell toxicity were validated in BV-2 microglial cell and freshly isolated smooth muscle cell (SMC) cultures. Laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (NV) and the suture-induced inflammatory corneal NV models of angiogenesis were used for in vivo validation of the novel CCBs. CX3CR1gfp/+ mice were used to examine the infiltration of GFP-labeled microglial cells. Results: We identified three compounds from the ZINC database (Zinc20267861, Zinc18204217, and Zinc33254827) as new blockers of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCC) using a structure-based pharmacophore approach. The effects of the three CCBs on Ca2+ influx into cells were verified in BV-2 microglial cells using Fura-2 fluorescent dye and in freshly isolated SMCs using the voltage-patch clamp. All three CCBs reduced microglial cell migration, activation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and reduced the expression of the inflammatory markers NF-κB (phospho-IκBα) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as reactive oxygen species. Of the three compounds, we further examined the in vivo activity of Zinc20267861. Topical treatment with Zinc20267861 in a rat model of suture-induced inflammatory cornea neovascularization demonstrated efficacy of the compound in reducing monocyte infiltration and overall corneal NV response. Subconjunctival administration of the compound in the choroidal NV mouse model effectively prevented CNV and microglial infiltration. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the novel CCBs identified here are effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be further evaluated for treating NV disorders and can be potentially applied in the treatment of ocular inflammatory and pathological angiogenetic disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schweitzer, Kelly S</author><author>Jinawath, Natini</author><author>Yonescu, Raluca</author><author>Ni, Kevin</author><author>Rush, Natalia</author><author>Charoensawan, Varodom</author><author>Bronova, Irina</author><author>Berdyshev, Evgeny</author><author>Leach, Sonia M</author><author>Gillenwater, Lucas A</author><author>Bowler, Russell P</author><author>Pearse, David B</author><author>Griffin, Constance A</author><author>Petrache, Irina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IGSF3 Mutation Identified in Patient With Severe COPD Alters Cell Function and Motility</title><secondary-title>JCI Insight</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JCI Insight</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/jci.insight.138101</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>10.1172/jci.insight.138101</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Cigarette smoking (CS) and genetic susceptibility determine the risk for development, progression, and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).

Examination of COPDGene cohort identified 14 IGSF3 SNPs of which, rs1414272 and rs12066192 were directly- and rs6703791 inversely associated with COPD severity, including COPD exacerbations. We confirmed that IGSF3 is a tetraspanin-interacting protein that colocalized with CD9 and integrin B1 in tetraspanin enriched domains. IGSF3-deficient patient-derived lymphoblastoids exhibited multiple alterations in gene expression, especially in the unfolded protein response and ceramide pathways. IGSF3-deficient lymphoblastoids had high ceramide- and sphingosine-1 phosphate-, but low glycosphingolipids- and gangliosides levels; were less apoptotic and more adherent; with marked changes in multiple TNFRSF molecules. Similarly, IGSF3 knockdown increased ceramide in lung structural cells, rendering them more adherent, with impaired wound repair and a weakened barrier function. These findings suggest that, by maintaining sphingolipid and membrane receptor homeostasis, IGSF3 is required for cell mobility-mediated lung injury repair. IGSF3 deficiency may increase susceptibility to CS-induced lung injury in COPD.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Leeuwen, Anoek LI</author><author>Naumann, David N</author><author>Dekker, Nicole AM</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>Hutchings, Sam D</author><author>Boer, Christa</author><author>van den Brom, Charissa E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro endothelial hyperpermeability occurs early following traumatic hemorrhagic shock</title><secondary-title>Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><keywords><keyword>Hemorrhagic shock</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier function</keyword><keyword>endothelial permeability</keyword><keyword>microcirculation</keyword><keyword>plasma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3233/CH-190642</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>10.3233/CH-190642</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Endothelial hyperpermeability is suggested to play a role in the development of microcirculatory perfusion disturbances and organ failure following hemorrhagic shock, but evidence is limited. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of plasma from traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients on in vitro endothelial barrier function. METHODS: Plasma from traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients was obtained at the emergency department (ED), the intensive care unit (ICU), 24 h after ICU admission and from controls (n = 8). Sublingual microcirculatory perfusion was measured using incident dark field videomicroscopy at matching time points. Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, the effects of plasma exposure on in vitro endothelial barrier function of human endothelial cells were assessed. RESULTS: Plasma from traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients collected at ED admission induced a 19% loss of in vitro endothelial resistance compared to plasma from controls (p &lt; 0.001). This loss was due to reduced cell-cell contacts (p &lt; 0.01). Plasma withdrawn at later time points did not affect endothelial barrier function (p &gt; 0.99). Interestingly, in vitro endothelial resistance showed a positive association with in vivo microcirculatory perfusion (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma from traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients obtained following ED admission, but not at later stages, induced in vitro endothelial hyperpermeability. This coincided with in vivo microcirculatory perfusion disturbances.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rom, Slava</author><author>Gajghate, Sachin</author><author>Winfield, Malika</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combination of HIV-1 and Diabetes Enhances Blood Brain Barrier Injury via Effects on Brain Endothelium and Pericytes</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4663</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>actin cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>bbb</keyword><keyword>diabetes</keyword><keyword>endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>hiv-1</keyword><keyword>hyperglycemia</keyword><keyword>pericytes</keyword><keyword>rearrangement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21134663</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Combination of HIV-1 and Diabetes Enhances Blood Brain Barrier Injury via Effects on Brain Endothelium and Pericytes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21134663</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;TEER</label><abstract>Despite combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) achieving efficient HIV replication control, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-known comorbidity of HAND in HIV-infected patients. Blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction has been linked recently to dementia development, specifically in DM patients. BBB injury exists both in HIV and DM, likely contributing to cognitive decline. However, its extent, exact cellular targets and mechanisms are largely unknown. In this report, we found a decrease in pericyte coverage and expression of tight junction proteins in human brain tissues from HIV patients with DM and evidence of HAND when compared to HIV-infected patients without DM or seronegative DM patients. Using our in vitro BBB models, we demonstrated diminution of barrier integrity, enhanced monocyte adhesion, changes in cytoskeleton and overexpression of adhesion molecules in primary human brain endothelial cells or human brain pericytes after exposure to HIV and DM-relevant stimuli. Our study demonstrates for the first-time evidence of impaired BBB function in HIV-DM patients and shows potential mechanisms leading to it in brain endothelium and pericytes that may result in poorer cognitive performance compared to individuals without HIV and DM.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horseman, Tim</author><author>Campbell, Carmen</author><author>Gomes, Grace</author><author>Fong, Keith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) as a novel method to evaluate bacterial urinary tract infections</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Immunology</full-title></periodical><volume>204</volume><issue>1 Supplement</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.jimmunol.org/content/204/1_Supplement/82.16</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>Urinary tractinfections (UTIs) are commonly acquired bacterial infections that cause significant morbidity, worsened by the rise of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogenic bacteria. Understanding the dynamics of bacterial UTIs is essential to the proper use of antimicrobial therapies in patient treatment. In this study, Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) technology was used to monitor bacterial-mediated cytotoxicity in-vitro enabling evaluation of antibiotics. Using the ECIS system, real-time changes of barrier function were recorded for human bladder epithelial cells infected with either antibiotic sensitive or resistant bacteria. This study employed four common uropathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The effect of different antimicrobials, antibiotic titers, and organism concentrations were evaluated. The addition of an antibiotic helped confirm and differentiate sensitive and resistant bacterial strains. Antibiotic concentrations at sensitive and resistant breakpoints were not as effective at high organism concentrations but were completely effective at lower more clinically relevant bacterial loads. The data showed bacterial strains resistant to co-cultured antibiotic took longer on average to degrade the cell monolayer than sensitive strains. Overall, these results indicate that antibiotic resistance is often associated with a fitness cost. Our findings support the use of ECIS to augment routine susceptibility data allowing the direct phenotypic measurement of bacterial virulence and the effects of antibiotic treatment on these strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Troy, Erin</author><author>Beahm, Derek</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing to Characterize Effects of Curcumin on NRK Cells</title><secondary-title>Biophysical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biophysical journal</full-title></periodical><volume>118</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2019.11.1782</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>Review</label><abstract>Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) is a real-time, label-free technique that can monitor a variety of cell behaviors on the same platform, including cell-attachment, spreading, proliferation, migration, and cell-cell junction formation. We demonstrate the use of ECIS to study the dose-dependent effects of curcumin on normal rat kidney cells (NRK) and compare results to traditional cell viability and wound healing assays. Curcumin is a lipophilic polyphenolic compound found in the tuberous root of the Curcuma longa plant (also known as turmeric) and used for centuries in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for its suspected anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Current research is aimed at understanding the effects of curcumin at the cellular level and at identifying its specific molecular targets. Cumulative results generated from different experimental strategies applied to different cell lines suggest curcumin can affect a broad range of cell behaviors and signaling pathways in a cell-type specific manner. Our understanding of the cellular effects of curcumin, as well as other naturopathic compounds, could benefit from the application of a common set of molecular or physiological assays across different cell types. The ability of ECIS to generate a multiparameter data set for any given cell line is well suited to serve as such an assay.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pallavi, Manishi</author><author>Waterman, Jenora</author><author>Koo, Youngmi</author><author>Sankar, Jagannathan</author><author>Yun, Yeoheung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of cytotoxicity of magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</title><secondary-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) s</keyword><keyword>Human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) 1.19 cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/app10062114</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Assessment of Cytotoxicity of Magnesium Oxide and Magnesium Hydroxide Nanoparticles using the Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Magnesium (Mg)-based alloys have the potential for bone repair due to their properties of biodegradation, biocompatibility, and structural stability, which can eliminate the requirement for a second surgery for the removal of the implant. Nevertheless, uncontrolled degradation rate and possible cytotoxicity of the corrosion products at the implant sites are known current challenges for clinical applications. In this study, we assessed in vitro cytotoxicity of different concentrations (0 to 50 mM) of possible corrosion products in the form of magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) nanoparticles (NPs) in human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) 1.19 cells. We measured cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and cytotoxicity using a real-time, label-free, non-invasive electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system. Our results suggest that 1mMconcentrations of MgO/Mg(OH)2 NPs are tolerable in hFOB 1.19 cells.

The function of CRTAC1 remains unknown but the protein's structure indicates a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions and calcium-binding. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of hCRTAC1-A on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). A battery of in vitro assays (biochemical and PCR), immunofluorescence and a biosensor approach were used to characterize the protein's biological activities on NHDF cells in a scratch assay. Gene expression analysis revealed that hCRTAC1-A protein is associated with altered levels of expression for genes involved in the processes of cell proliferation (CXCL12 and NOS2), cell migration (AQP3 and TNC), and extracellular matrix-ECM regeneration and remodeling (FMOD, TIMP1, FN1) indicating a role for hCRTAC1-A in promoting these activities in a scratch assay. In parallel, the candidate processes identified by differential gene transcription were substantiated and extended using Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology, immunofluorescence and cell viability assays. Our findings indicate that hCRTAC1-A stimulated cell proliferation, migration and ECM production in primary human fibroblasts in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bruikman, Caroline S.</author><author>Vreeken, Dianne</author><author>Zhang, Huayu</author><author>van Gils, Marit J.</author><author>Peter, Jorge</author><author>van Zonneveld, Anton Jan</author><author>Hovingh, G.

In the current study, we investigated the role of a c.1769G &gt; T variant in Netrin-1 in (premature) atherosclerosis. Methods: To determine the effect of the genetic variation, purified Netrin-1, either wild type (wtNetrin-1) or the patient observed variation (mutNetrin-1), was used for migration, adhesion, endothelial barrier function and bindings assays. Expression of adhesion molecules and transcription proteins was analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot or ELISA. To further delineate how mutNetrin-1 mediates its effect on cell migration, lenti-viral knockdown of UNC5B or DCC was used. Results: Bindings assays revealed a decreased binding capacity of mutNetrin-1 to the receptors UNC5B, DCC and β3-integrin and an increased binding capacity to neogenin, heparin and heparan sulfate compared to wtNetrin-1. Exposure of endothelial cells to mutNetrin-1 resulted in enhanced monocyte adhesion and expression of IL-6, CCL2 and ICAM-1 compared to wtNetrin-1. In addition, mutNetrin-1 lacks the inhibitory effect on the NF-κB pathway that is observed for wtNetrin-1. Moreover, the presence of mutNetrin-1 diminished migration of macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Importantly, UNC5B or DCC specific knockdown showed that mutNetrin-1 is unable to act through DCC resulting in enhanced inhibition of migration. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that mutNetrin-1 fails to exert anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells and more strongly blocks macrophage migration compared to wtNetrin-1, suggesting that the carriers of this genetic molecular variant may well be at risk for premature atherosclerosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rashid, Mahamud-ur</author><author>Zahedi-amiri, Ali</author><author>Glover, Kathleen K M</author><author>Gao, Ang</author><author>Nickol, E</author><author>Kindrachuk, Jason</author><author>Wilkins, John A</author><author>Coombs, Kevin M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Zika virus dysregulates human Sertoli cell proteins involved in spermatogenesis with little effect on tight junctions</title><secondary-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pntd.0008335</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Zika Virus Dysregulates Human Sertoli Cell Proteins Involved in Spermatogenesis With Little Effect on Tight Junctions.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008335</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Zika virus (ZIKV), a neglected tropical disease until its re-emergence in 2007, causes microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Its re-emergence and spread to more than 80 countries led the World Health Organization in 2016 to declare a Public Health Emergency. ZIKV is mainly transmitted by mosquitos, but can persist in infected human male semen for prolonged periods and may be sexually transmitted. Testicular Sertoli cells support ZIKV replication and may be a reservoir for persistent ZIKV infection. Electrical impedance analyses indicated ZIKV infection rapidly disrupted Vero cell monolayers but had little effect upon human Sertoli cells (HSerC). We determined ZIKV-induced proteomic changes in HSerC using an aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan) targeting &gt;1300 human proteins. ZIKV infection caused differential expression of 299 proteins during three different time points, including 5 days after infection. Dysregulated proteins are involved in different bio-functions, including cell death and survival, cell cycle, maintenance of cellular function, cell signaling, cellular assembly, morphology, movement, molecular transport, and immune response. Many signaling pathways important for maintenance of HSerC function and spermatogenesis were highly dysregulated. These included IL-6, IGF1, EGF, NF-κB, PPAR, ERK/MAPK, and growth hormone signaling. Down-regulation of the PPAR signaling pathway might impact cellular energy supplies. Upstream molecule analysis also indicated microRNAs involved in germ cell development were downregulated by infection. Overall, this study leads to a better understanding of Sertoli cellular mechanisms used by ZIKV during persistent infection and possible ZIKV impacts on spermatogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Huayu</author><author>Vreeken, Dianne</author><author>Junaid, Abidemi</author><author>Wang, Gangqi</author><author>Sol, Wendy M.P.J.</author><author>de Bruin, Ruben G.</author><author>van Zonneveld, Anton Jan</author><author>van Gils, Janine M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial semaphorin 3F maintains endothelial barrier function and inhibits monocyte migration</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Semaphorin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32098168</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms21041471</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial Semaphorin 3F Maintains Endothelial Barrier Function and Inhibits Monocyte Migration.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>In normal physiology, endothelial cells (ECs) form a vital barrier between the blood and underlying tissue controlling leukocyte diapedesis and vascular inflammation. Emerging data suggest that neuronal guidance cues, typically expressed during development, have roles outside the nervous system in vascular biology and immune responses. In particular, Class III semaphorins have been reported to affect EC migration and angiogenesis. While ECs express high levels of semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F), little is known about its function in mature ECs. Here we show that SEMA3F expression is reduced by inflammatory stimuli and increased by laminar flow. Endothelial cells exposed to laminar flow secrete SEMA3F, which subsequently binds to heparan sulfates on the surface of ECs. However, under pro-inflammatory conditions, reduced levels of SEMA3F make ECs more prone to monocyte diapedesis and display impaired barrier function as measured with an electric cell–substrate impedance sensing system and a microfluidic system. In addition, we demonstrate that SEMA3F can directly inhibit the migration of activated monocytes. Taken together, our data suggest an important homeostatic function for EC-expressed SEMA3F, serving as a mediator of endothelial quiescence.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tung, Tse-Hua</author><author>Wang, Si-Han</author><author>Huang, Chun-Chung</author><author>Su, Tai-Yuan</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of Discrete Wavelet Transform to Assess Impedance Fluctuations Obtained From Cellular Micromotion</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><volume>20</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>cytochalasin B</keyword><keyword>discrete wavelet transform</keyword><keyword>micromotion</keyword><keyword>signal magnitude area</keyword><keyword>variance.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.3390/s20113250</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/s20113250</url></web-urls></urls><label>Micromotion</label><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an attractive method for monitoring cell behaviors in tissue culture in real time. The time series impedance fluctuations of the cell-covered electrodes measured by ECIS are the phenomena accompanying cellular micromotion as cells continually rearrange their cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion sites. Accurate assessment of these fluctuations to extract useful information from raw data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. In this study, we apply discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze the concentration-dependent effect of cytochalasin B on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The sampling rate of the impedance time series is 1 Hz and each data set consists of 2048 points. Our results demonstrate that, in the Daubechies (db) wavelet family, db1 is the optimal mother wavelet function for DWT-based analysis to assess the effect of cytochalasin B on HUVEC micromotion. By calculating the energy, standard deviation, variance, and signal magnitude area of DWT detail coefficients at level 1, we are able to significantly distinguish cytotoxic concentrations of cytochalasin B as low as 0.1 μM, and in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, DWT-based analysis indicates the possibility to decrease the sampling rate of the micromotion measurement from 1 Hz to 1/16 Hz without decreasing the discerning power. The statistical measures of DWT detail coefficients are effective methods for determining both the sampling rate and the number of individual samples for ECIS-based micromotion assays.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khorolsuren, Zambaga</author><author>Lang, Orsolya</author><author>Pallinger, Eva</author><author>Foldes, Anna</author><author>Szabolcs, Gyulai-Gaal</author><author>Varga, Gabor</author><author>Mezo, Gabor</author><author>Vag, Janos</author><author>Kohidai, Laszlo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional and Cell Surface Characteristics of Periodontal Ligament Cells (PDLCs) on RGD-synthetic Polypeptide Conjugate Coatings</title><secondary-title>J Periodontal Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>J Periodontal Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1111/jre.12760</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/jre.12760</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Differentiation</label><abstract>Background and objective: Periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) are an important source for periodontal tissue healing and regeneration. Proper cell adhesion is a key for survival of anchorage-dependent cells and also initiates further intracellular signals for essential cellular functions. We aimed to test 3 different synthetic conjugates with integrin-binding RGD sequence (SAK-c[RGDfC], AK-c[RGDfC], and SAK-opn on the adhesion of human PDLCs and subsequent events including proliferation, migration, behavior of cell surface molecules, and osteogenic differentiation. Materials and methods: Synthetic peptides were synthesized by solid-phase technique and attached to branched chain polymeric polypeptides via thioether linkage. Simple adsorption method was used to coat tissue culture plastic or electric arrays. PDLCs were isolated from 24 surgically extracted human third molars. Cell adhesion and proliferation were measured with real-time impedimetric xCELLigence SP system. Cell migration assay was performed with Ibidi® Culture inserts. Cell surface antigens were detected using flow cytometry analysis. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and Alizarin Red S staining, and real-time qPCR was performed to analyze the osteoblast-related gene expression. Osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation of PDLCs were monitored by real-time Electrical Cell-Substrate Impedance Spectroscopy (ECIS). Results: Primary outcome of this study relies on that all three synthetic RGD peptides improved PDLC adhesion (P &lt; .05). When animal serum is absent in culture medium, SAK-c[RGDfC] and AK-c[RGDfC] elevated cell adhesion (P &lt; .05). Cell migration was enhanced by SAK-c[RGDfC] and AK-c[RGDfC] (P &lt; .05). After 1-week treatment, all synthetic peptides elevated CD105 (1.7- to 2.2-fold) and CD146 (1.3- to 1.5-fold) markers and caused different integrin patterns. ALP activity (1.4-fold) and ARS (1.8- and 2.0-fold) were increased by SAK-c[RGDfC] and AK-c[RGDfC] in absence of osteogenic supplements, and all the peptides supported the mineralization under osteogenic condition (P &lt; .05). RT-qPCR revealed the upregulation of bone sialoprotein (5.0- to 7.8-fold), osteocalcin (2.3- to 2.7-fold), and ALP (1.9- to 2.3-fold) gene expression in osteogenesis-induced PDLCs. ECIS monitoring showed that higher impedance was generated by the osteogenic induction compared with the adipogenic or the non-induced (P &lt; .05). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that SAK-c[RGDfC] and AK-c[RGDfC] improved adhesion and migration of PDLCs and supported osteogenic differentiation of PDLCs. These cyclic RGD peptides proved to be applicable biocompatible material in regenerative medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Hyeran</author><author>Kim, Young Mee</author><author>Cho, Moonjae</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytoplasm-localized SIRT1 downregulation attenuates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer A549 cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>4495-4509</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>apoptosis</keyword><keyword>cell cycle arrest</keyword><keyword>cisplatin-resistant lung cancer</keyword><keyword>emt</keyword><keyword>sirt1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.7150/jca.44383</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cytoplasm-localized SIRT1 downregulation attenuates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer A549 cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Proliferation</label><abstract>Objective: We propose that sirtuin (SIRT) may induce a pro-apoptotic effect by deacetylating transcription factors in A549 cells: depletion of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) induced cell cycle arrest in cisplatin-resistant A549 (A549/CADD) cells. Methods: Protein and mRNA levels of SIRT1 were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. In A549 and A549/CADD cells, the cytotoxicity of cisplatin administration was evaluated by MTT assay, proliferation was measured by ECIS, and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed using FACS. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-SIRT1 or pcDNA3.1-Myc-Control vectors to analyze the impact of SIRT-1 on cisplatin induced drug resistance. SIRT1 localization was studied using immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, immunoprecipitation and 20S proteasome activity assay were performed to examine the relationship of SIRT1 with the proteasome complex. Results: A549/CADD cells exhibited a mesenchymal-like cell characteristic. SIRT1 expression was markedly decreased in A549/CADD cells. We observed that cisplatin regulates p53 stability through the depletion of ubiquitination following SIRT1 downregulation. Furthermore, cisplatin treatment increased proteasomal activity and significantly decreased cytoplasmic SIRT1 protein levels in A549/CADD cells.

Microvascular compromise was described one DM complication. Recently we showed blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and memory loss are associated with diminution of tight junctions (TJ) in brain endothelium and pericyte coverage and inflammation in cerebral microvessels and brain tissue paralleling hyperglycemia in mice of both DM types. The current study demonstrates that exposure of brain microvessels to hyperglycemic conditions or advanced glycation end products (AGEs) ex vivo resulted in significant abnormalities in membranous distribution of TJ proteins. We found significant increase in the amount of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from DM mice and enhanced presence of TJ proteins, occludin and claudin-5, on EVs. Exposure of BMVECs to high glucose and AGEs led to significant augmentation of ICAM and VCAM expression, elevated leukocyte adhesion to and migration across BMVEC monolayers, and increased BBB permeability in vitro. Pericytes exposed to hyperglycemia and AGEs displayed diminished expression of integrin α1, PDGF-R1β and connexin-43. Our findings indicate BBB compromise in DM ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo models in association with BMVEC/pericyte dysfunction and inflammation. Prevention of BBB injury may be a new therapeutic approach to avert cognitive demise in DM.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camp, Sara M.</author><author>Marciniak, Alexander</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T.</author><author>Garcia, Alexander N.</author><author>Bittman, Robert</author><author>Polt, Robin</author><author>Perez, Ruth G.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-independent lung endothelial cell barrier disruption induced by FTY720 regioisomers</title><secondary-title>Pulmonary Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonary Circulation</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>FTY720</keyword><keyword>acute respiratory distress syndrome</keyword><keyword>endothelial</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>regioisomer</keyword><keyword>sphingosine 1-phosphate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/2045894020905521</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-independent lung endothelial cell barrier disruption induced by FTY720 regioisomers.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Rationale: Vascular permeability is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-induced lung injury pathobiology; however, the mechanisms underlying this vascular dysregulation remain unclear, thereby impairing the development of desperately needed effective therapeutics. We have shown that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and 2-amino-2-(2-[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-propanediol (FTY720) analogues are useful tools for exploring vascular barrier regulation mechanisms. Objective: To experimentally define the effects of FTY720 regioisomers on lung endothelial cell barrier regulation. Methods: Specific barrier-regulatory receptor and kinase inhibitors were utilized to probe signaling mechanisms involved in FTY720 regioisomer-mediated human lung endothelial cell barrier responses (trans-endothelial electrical resistance, TER). Docking simulations with the S1P1 receptor were performed to further evaluate FTY720 regioisomer signaling. Results: FTY720 regioisomers produced potent endothelial cell barrier disruption reflected by declines in TER alterations. Pharmacologic inhibition of Gi-coupled S1P receptors (S1P1, S1P2, S1P3) failed to alter FTY720 regioisomer-mediated barrier disruption; findings that were corroborated by docking simulations demonstrating FTY720 regiosomers were repelled from S1P1 docking, in contrast to strong S1P1 binding elicited by S1P. Inhibition of either the barrier-disrupting PAR-1 receptor, the VEGF receptor, Rho-kinase, MAPK, NFkB, or PI3K failed to alter FTY720 regioisomer-induced endothelial cell barrier disruption. While FTY720 regioisomers significantly increased protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity, PP2A inhibitors failed to alter FTY720 regioisomer-induced endothelial cell barrier disruption. Conclusions: Together, these results imply a vexing model of pulmonary vascular barrier dysregulation in response to FTY720-related compounds and highlight the need for further insights into mechanisms of vascular integrity required to promote the development of novel therapeutic tools to prevent or reverse the pulmonary vascular leak central to ARDS outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rangasamy, Sampathkumar</author><author>Monickaraj, Finny</author><author>Legendre, Christophe</author><author>Cabrera, Andrea P.</author><author>Llaci, Lorida</author><author>Bilagody, Cherae</author><author>McGuire, Paul</author><author>Das, Arup</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptomics analysis of pericytes from retinas of diabetic animals reveals novel genes and molecular pathways relevant to blood-retinal barrier alterations in diabetic retinopathy</title><secondary-title>Experimental Eye Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Eye Research</full-title></periodical><pages>108043</pages><volume>195</volume><issue>March</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood retinal barrier</keyword><keyword>Diabetic retinopathy</keyword><keyword>Notch3</keyword><keyword>Pericytes</keyword><keyword>RNA Sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2020.108043</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Transcriptomics analysis of pericytes from retinas of diabetic animals reveals novel genes and molecular pathways relevant to blood-retinal barrier alterations in diabetic retinopathy..pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2020.108043</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Selective pericyte loss, the histological hallmark of early diabetic retinopathy (DR), enhances the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in diabetes. However, the role of pericytes on BRB alteration in diabetes and the signaling pathways involved in their effects are currently unknown. To understand the role of diabetes-induced molecular alteration of pericytes, we performed transcriptomic analysis of sorted retinal pericytes from mice model of diabetes. Retinal tissue from non-diabetic and diabetic (duration 3 months) mouse eyes (n = 10 in each group) were used to isolate pericytes through fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) using pericyte specific fluorescent antibodies, PDGFRb-APC. For RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis, a cDNA library was generated using template switching oligo and the resulting libraries were sequenced using paired-end Illumina sequencing. Molecular functional pathways were analyzed using differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Differential expression analysis revealed 217 genes significantly upregulated and 495 genes downregulated, in pericytes isolated from diabetic animals. These analyses revealed a core set of differentially expressed genes that could potentially contribute to the pericyte dysfunction in diabetes and highlighted the pattern of functional connectivity between key candidate genes and blood retinal barrier alteration mechanisms. The top up-regulated gene list included: Ext2, B3gat3, Gpc6, Pip5k1c and Pten and down-regulated genes included: Notch3, Xbp1, Gpc4, Atp1a2 and AKT3. Out of these genes, we further validated one of the down regulated genes, Notch 3 and its role in BRB alteration in diabetic retinopathy. We confirmed the downregulation of Notch3 expression in human retinal pericytes exposed to Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) treatment mimicking the chronic hyperglycemia effect. Exploration of pericyte-conditioned media demonstrated that loss of NOTCH3 in pericyte led to increased permeability of endothelial cell monolayers. Collectively, we identify a role for NOTCH3 in pericyte dysfunction in diabetes. Further validation of other DEGs to identify cell specific molecular change through whole transcriptomic approach in diabetic retina will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of DR and novel therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Xiaohua</author><author>Eitnier, Rebecca A.</author><author>Beard, Richard S.</author><author>Meegan, Jamie E.</author><author>Yang, Xiaoyuan</author><author>Aponte, Alexandra M.</author><author>Wang, Fang</author><author>Nelson, Peter R.</author><author>Wu, Mack H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Focal adhesion kinase and Src mediate microvascular hyperpermeability caused by fibrinogen- γC- terminal fragments</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0231739</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>32352989</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0231739</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Focal adhesion kinase and Src mediate microvascular hyperpermeability caused by fibrinogen- γC- terminal fragments.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231739</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>OBJECTIVES: We previously reported microvascular leakage resulting from fibrinogen-γ chain C-terminal products (γC) occurred via a RhoA-dependent mechanism. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the signaling mechanism by which γC induces endothelial hyperpermeability. Since it is known that γC binds and activates endothelial αvβ3, a transmembrane integrin receptor involved in intracellular signaling mediated by the tyrosine kinases FAK and Src, we hypothesized that γC alters endothelial barrier function by activating the FAK-Src pathway leading to junction dissociation and RhoA driven cytoskeletal stress-fiber formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using intravital microscopy of rat mesenteric microvessels, we show increased extravasation of plasma protein (albumin) resulting from γC administration. In addition, capillary fluid filtration coefficient (Kfc) indicated γC-induced elevated lung vascular permeability. Furthermore, γC decreased transendothelial barrier resistance in a time-dependent and dose-related fashion in cultured rat lung microvascular endothelial cells (RLMVECs), accompanied by increased FAK/Src phosphorylation detection by western blot. Experiments with pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of FAK showed significantly reduced γC-induced albumin and fluid leakage across microvessels, stress-fiber formation, VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation, and improved γC-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, indicating the involvement of FAK in γC mediated hyperpermeability. Comparable results were found when Src was targeted in a similar manner, however inhibition of FAK prevented Src activation, suggesting that FAK is upstream of Src in γC-mediated hyperpermeability. In addition, γC-induced cytoskeletal stress-fiber formation was attenuated during inhibition or silencing of these tyrosine kinases, concomitantly with RhoA inhibition. CONCLUSION: The FAK-Src pathway contributes to γC-induced microvascular barrier dysfunction, junction protein phosphorylation and disorganization in a manner that involves RhoA and stress-fiber formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Chun-Chung</author><author>Tung, Tse-Hua</author><author>Huang, Chien-Chu</author><author>Lin, Shao-Yi</author><author>Chao, Shih-Chi</author><author>Chiu, Sheng-Po</author><author>Lee, Shiao-Pieng</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrochemical Assessment of Anticancer Compounds on the Human Tongue Squamous</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><pages>2632</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092632</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electrochemical Assessment of Anticancer Compounds on the Human Tongue Squamous Carcinoma Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092632</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Modeling;cytotoxicity</label><abstract>The most common oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its highest occurrence is in the tongue. Almost 30% of patients with one primary head and neck tumor will have a second primary malignancy. In recent studies, two novel plant extracts, andrographolide and cannabidiol (CBD), have been exploited for their anticancer effects. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of these two compounds on SCC-25 cells, a human tongue squamous carcinoma cell line, and compared the outcomes with two chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin and fluorouracil. Electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system was applied to measure frequency- and time-dependent impedance of SCC-25 cell-covered electrodes and to further assess subtle changes in cell morphology and micromotion in response to different concentrations (0, 10, 30, 100, and 300 µM) of these compounds. AlamarBlue and Annexin V/7-AAD binding assays were used to measure the concentration dependent changes in viability and apoptosis of SCC-25 cells. Our results demonstrate that 24 hours after exposure to 30 µM CBD can significantly decrease the micromotion rate, damage the integrity of cell morphology, reduce cell viability, and induce higher apoptosis in treated SCC-25 cells, while the other three drugs attain similar effects at the concentration of 100 µM or higher. The apoptosis-induced changes in cell morphology and micromotion monitored by ECIS correlate well with biochemical assays. Thus, both frequency- and time-dependent impedance measurements using ECIS can be used to real-time follow cancer cell activities in response to anticancer drugs with different temporal cytotoxicity profiles.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frausto, Ricardo F</author><author>Swamy, Vinay S</author><author>Peh, Gary S L</author><author>Boere, Payton M</author><author>Hanser, E Maryam</author><author>Chung, Doug D</author><author>George, Benjamin L</author><author>Morselli, Marco</author><author>Kao, Liyo</author><author>Azimov, Rustam</author><author>Wu, Jessica</author><author>Pellegrini, Matteo</author><author>Kurtz, Ira</author><author>Mehta, Jodhbir S</author><author>Aldave, Anthony J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phenotypic and functional characterization of corneal endothelial cells during in vitro expansion</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>7402</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-64311-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Phenotypic and functional characterization of corneal endothelial cells during in vitro expansion.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64311-x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Modeling</label><abstract>the advent of cell culture-based methods for the establishment and expansion of human corneal endothelial cells (CEnC) has provided a source of transplantable corneal endothelium, with a significant potential to challenge the one donor-one recipient paradigm.

METHODS: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers were used to model the endothelial barrier. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), Transwell assays, and immunofluorescence labeling of junctional proteins were used to evaluate endothelial barrier function. Endothelial cell bioenergetics were determined using extracellular flux analysis and direct ATP level measurements. The endothelial-specific contribution of σ1 was tested using the σ1-selective agonist, PRE-084, and with targeted knockdown of σ1 expression using siRNA. RESULTS: Activation of σ1 with PRE-084 significantly enhanced endothelial barrier function and decreased permeability to albumin and dextran. Knockdown of σ1 with siRNA reduced barrier function and abolished PRE-084-induced endothelial barrier enhancement. PRE-084 upregulated endothelial glycolysis and glycolytic ATP production, but this response was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of σ1 expression. PRE-084 also reduced the degree of endothelial barrier dysfunction caused by the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler CCCP. CONCLUSION: Activation of σ1 enhances endothelial barrier function and modulates the ratio of glycolytic versus mitochondrial ATP production. These novel findings suggest that endothelial σ1 may prove beneficial as a novel therapeutic target for reducing microvascular hyperpermeability and counteracting mitochondrial dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paul, Jefri Jeya</author><author>Weigel, Cynthia</author><author>Müller, Tina</author><author>Heller, Regine</author><author>Spiegel, Sarah</author><author>Gräler, Markus H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inflammatory Conditions Disrupt Constitutive Endothelial Cell Barrier Stabilization by Alleviating Autonomous Secretion of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate</title><secondary-title>Cells</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cells</full-title></periodical><pages>928</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Inflammatory Conditions Disrupt Constitutive Endothelial Cell Barrier Stabilization by Alleviating Autonomous Secretion of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040928</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Inflammation</label><abstract>The breakdown of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier contributes significantly to sepsis mortality. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is one of the most effective EC barrier-stabilizing signaling molecules. Stabilization is mainly transduced via the S1P receptor type 1 (S1PR1). Here, we demonstrate that S1P was autonomously produced by ECs. S1P secretion was significantly higher in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) compared to the endothelial cell line EA.hy926. Constitutive barrier stability of HUVEC, but not EA.hy926, was significantly compromised by the S1PR1 antagonist W146 and by the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab. HUVEC and EA.hy926 differed in the expression of the S1P-transporter Spns2, which allowed HUVEC, but not EA.hy926, to secrete S1P into the extracellular space. Spns2 deficient mice showed increased serum albumin leakage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lung ECs isolated from Spns2 deficient mice revealed increased leakage of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled dextran and decreased resistance in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measurements. Spns2 was down-regulated in HUVEC after stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which contributed to destabilization of the EC barrier. Our work suggests a new mechanism for barrier integrity maintenance. Secretion of S1P by EC via Spns2 contributed to constitutive EC barrier maintenance, which was disrupted under inflammatory conditions via the down-regulation of the S1P-transporter Spns2</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rizzo, Alicia N.</author><author>Belvitch, Patrick</author><author>Demeritte, Regaina</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author><author>Letsiou, Eleftheria</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arg mediates LPS-induced disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier</title><secondary-title>Vascular Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vascular Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>106677</pages><issue>October 2019</issue><keywords><keyword>ARDS</keyword><keyword>Acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>Arg</keyword><keyword>C-Abl</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Imatinib</keyword><keyword>LPS</keyword><keyword>Vascular permeability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vph.2020.106677</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Arg mediates LPS-induced disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153718911930285X?dgcid=rss_sd_all&amp;utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating disease process that involves dysregulated inflammation and decreased alveolar-capillary barrier function. Despite increased understanding of the pathophysiology, no effective targeted therapies exist to treat ARDS. Recent preclinical studies suggest that the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, which targets the Abl kinases c-Abl and Arg, has the potential to restore endothelial dysfunction caused by inflammatory agonists. Prior work demonstrates that imatinib attenuates LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced vascular leak and inflammation; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain incompletely understood. In the current study, we demonstrate that imatinib inhibits LPS induced increase in the phosphorylation of CrkL, a specific substrate of Abl kinases, in human pulmonary endothelial cells. Specific silencing of Arg, and not c-Abl, attenuated LPS-induced pulmonary vascular permeability as measured by electrical cellular impedance sensing (ECIS) and gap formation assays. In addition, direct activation of Abl family kinases with the small molecule activator DPH resulted in endothelial barrier disruption that was attenuated by Arg siRNA. In complementary studies to characterize the mechanisms by which Arg mediates endothelial barrier function, Arg silencing was found to inhibit LPS-induced disruption of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLC). Overall, these results characterize the mechanisms by which imatinib protects against LPS-induced endothelial barrier disruption and suggest that Arg inhibition may represent a novel strategy to enhance endothelial barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stahl, Klaus</author><author>Schmidt, Bernhard M.W.</author><author>Hoeper, Marius M.</author><author>Skripuletz, Thomas</author><author>Möhn, Nora</author><author>Beutel, Gernot</author><author>Eder, Matthias</author><author>Welte, Tobias</author><author>Ganser, Arnold</author><author>Falk, Christine S.</author><author>Koenecke, Christian</author><author>David, Sascha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracorporeal cytokine removal in severe CAR-T cell associated cytokine release syndrome</title><secondary-title>Journal of Critical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Critical Care</full-title></periodical><pages>124-129</pages><volume>57</volume><keywords><keyword>CAR-T-cell</keyword><keyword>Cytokine release syndrome</keyword><keyword>Extracorporeal cytokine adsorption</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.02.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Extracorporeal cytokine removal in severe CAR-T cell associated cytokine release syndrome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.02.010</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Inflammation</label><abstract>Purpose: Life-threatening complications of CD-19 Chimeric antigen receptor - T (CAR-T) cells such as the cytokine release syndrome (CRS)) have been reported. Treatment is limited to IL-6 blockade and steroids although global removal of elevated soluble inflammatory factors might be more effective. Methods: Clinical course of a CRS patient treated with extracorporeal cytokine adsorption (Cytosorb®). A panel of 48 cytokines, chemokines and endothelial markers has been analyzed longitudinally. Ex vivo stimulation of endothelial cells to visualize (immunocytochemistry) and quantify (ECIS, TER) endothelial barrier effects. Results: Following CAR-T cell application a 65 years old male developed grade 4 CRS with refractory shock (3 vasopressors) and severe capillary leakage (+37 L/24 h resuscitation). Treatment included IL-6 blockade, methylprednisolone and additionally Cytosorb hemoperfusion. While multiple soluble inflammatory factors were elevated and most of them decreased by more than 50% following Cytosorb, markers of endothelial injury increased steadily (e.g. Angpt-2/Angpt-1) leading to profound endothelial activation and leakage in ex vivo assays. Conclusion: This is the first reported use of cytokine adsorption for CRS showing efficacy in absorption of various cytokines but not endothelial growth factors.

To better understand the role of PlGF in DR, we used tandem mass tags (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics to human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs), treated anti-PlGF antibody, and PBS as a control. Functional annotation and pathway enrichments were performed, which suggested that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were involved in key metabolic processes, protein binding, and membrane, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and adherens junction. We conducted integrated gene profiles of our previously published transcriptomic data to the TMT-labeled proteomics data. The results showed the sixty genes were found to be changed at the proteome level. The functional annotation conducted for the sixty proteins suggested that 58.3% of proteins were involved in PPP, 25% of proteins were in interleukin-12 singling and 16.7% of proteins were involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway. Mass spectrometry results were validated by transendothelial electrical resistance measurement by an electrical cell-impedance sensing (ECIS) and western blot analysis of VE-cadherin, G6PD. These findings suggest that the PPP proteins and antioxidants may act as a downstream target of PlGF and may play a decisive role in HREC biological functions in DR. Significance: PlGF (Placental growth factor) is known to play a pivotal role in pathological angiogenesis and inflammation by stimulating endothelial cell migration and by recruiting pericytes and inflammatory cells such as microglia and macrophages. Despite the well-defined pathophysiological roles of PlGF, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not completely understood, especially the exact relationships between biochemical events and molecular pathways regulated by PlGF, whose inhibition exhibits a protective role in DR. This study provides new insights into protein expression patterns and enables the identification of many attractive candidates for investigation of PPP pathway role in the activation of the antioxidant defense system in DR. Our findings suggest that the PPP proteins and antioxidants (PRDX6, HMOX1, NQO1 and YES1) may act as downstream targets of PlGF and may play a decisive role in HREC biological functions in DR.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morgan, Katie</author><author>Gamal, Wesam</author><author>Samuel, Kay</author><author>Morley, Steven D</author><author>Hayes, Peter C</author><author>Bagnaninchi, Pierre</author><author>Plevris, John N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of Impedance-Based Techniques in Hepatology Research</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>50</issue><keywords><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>hepatology</keyword><keyword>impedance based cellular assay</keyword><keyword>liver</keyword><keyword>teer</keyword><keyword>xcelligence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Application of Impedance-Based Techniques in Hepatology research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Migration;Review;Virology</label><abstract>There are a variety of end-point assays and techniques available to monitor hepatic cell cultures and study toxicity within in vitro models. These commonly focus on one aspect of cell metabolism and are often destructive to cells. Impedance-based cellular assays (IBCAs) assess biological functions of cell populations in real-time by measuring electrical impedance, which is the resistance to alternating current caused by the dielectric properties of proliferating of cells. While the uses of IBCA have been widely reported for a number of tissues, specific uses in the study of hepatic cell cultures have not been reported to date. IBCA monitors cellular behaviour throughout experimentation non-invasively without labelling or damage to cell cultures. The data extrapolated from IBCA can be correlated to biological events happening within the cell and therefore may inform drug toxicity studies or other applications within hepatic research. Because tight junctions comprise the blood/biliary barrier in hepatocytes, there are major consequences when these junctions are disrupted, as many pathologies centre around the bile canaliculi and flow of bile out of the liver. The application of IBCA in hepatology provides a unique opportunity to assess cellular polarity and patency of tight junctions, vital to maintaining normal hepatic function. Here, we describe how IBCAs have been applied to measuring the effect of viral infection, drug toxicity/IC50, cholangiopathies, cancer metastasis and monitoring of the gut-liver axis. We also highlight key areas of research where IBCAs could be used in future applications within the field of hepatology</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nahid, Md A.</author><author>Campbell, Carmen E.</author><author>Fong, Keith S.K.</author><author>Barnhill, Jason C.</author><author>Washington, Michael A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An evaluation of the impact of clinical bacterial isolates on epithelial cell monolayer integrity by the electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) method</title><secondary-title>Journal of Microbiological Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Microbiological Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>105833</pages><volume>169</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mimet.2020.105833</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Nahid et al. - 2020 - An evaluation of the impact of clinical bacterial isolates on epithelial cell monolayer integrity by the electric.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167701219302581</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Cytotoxicity</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frausto, Ricardo F.</author><author>Chung, Doug D.</author><author>Boere, Payton M.</author><author>Swamy, Vinay S.</author><author>Duong, Huong N.V.</author><author>Kao, Liyo</author><author>Azimov, Rustam</author><author>Zhang, Wenlin</author><author>Carrigan, Liam</author><author>Wong, Davey</author><author>Morselli, Marco</author><author>Zakharevich, Marina</author><author>Hanser, E.

ZEB1 plays an integral role in mediating cell state transitions during cell lineage specification, wound healing and disease. EMT/MET are characterized by distinct changes in molecular and cellular phenotype that are generally contextindependent. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), associated with ZEB1 insufficiency, provides a new biological context in which to understand and evaluate the classic EMT/MET paradigm. PPCD is characterized by a cadherin-switch and transition to an epithelial-like transcriptomic and cellular phenotype, which we study in a cell-based model of PPCD generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ZEB1 knockout in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). Transcriptomic and functional studies support the hypothesis that CEnC undergo a MET-like transition in PPCD, termed endothelial to epithelial transition (EnET), and lead to the conclusion that EnET may be considered a corollary to the classic EMT/MET paradigm.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krüger, Katharina</author><author>Schmid, Sebastian</author><author>Paulsen, Friedrich</author><author>Ignatius, Anita</author><author>Klinger, Patricia</author><author>Hotfiel, Thilo</author><author>Swoboda, Bernd</author><author>Gelse, Kolja</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is involved in cell migration for skeletal repair</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell migration</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Fracture healing</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal progenitor cells</keyword><keyword>TFF3</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>4991318542121</isbn><accession-num>31480518</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms20174277</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) Is Involved in Cell Migration for Skeletal Repair.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijms20174277</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The aim of the study was to explore the possible role of Trefoil Factor Family peptide 3 (TFF3) for skeletal repair. The expression of TFF3 was analyzed in human joint tissues as well as in a murine bone fracture model. Serum levels of TFF3 following a defined skeletal trauma in humans were determined by ELISA. The mRNA expression of TFF3 was analyzed under normoxia and hypoxia. Expression analysis after stimulation of human mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) with TFF3 was performed by RT2 Profiler PCR Array. The effect of recombinant human (rh)TFF3 on MPCs was analysed by different migration and chemotaxis assays. The effect on cell motility was also visualized by fluorescence staining of F-Actin. TFF3 was absent in human articular cartilage, but strongly expressed in the subchondral bone and periosteum of adult joints. Strong TFF3 immunoreactivity was also detected in murine fracture callus. Serum levels of TFF3 were significantly increased after skeletal trauma in humans. Expression analysis demonstrated that rhTFF3 significantly decreased mRNA of ROCK1. Wound healing assays showed increased cell migration of MPCs by rhTFF3. The F-Actin cytoskeleton was markedly influenced by rhTFF3. Cell proliferation was not increased by rhTFF3. The data demonstrate elevated expression of TFF3 after skeletal trauma. The stimulatory effects on cell motility and migration of MPCs suggest a role of TFF3 in skeletal repair.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Nini</author><author>Heruth, Daniel P.</author><author>Wu, Weibin</author><author>Zhang, Li Qin</author><author>Nsumu, Marianne N.</author><author>Shortt, Katherine</author><author>Li, Kelvin</author><author>Jiang, Xun</author><author>Wang, Baoxi</author><author>Friesen, Craig</author><author>Li, Ding You</author><author>Ye, Shui Qing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional characterization of SLC26A3 c.392C&gt;G (p.P131R) mutation in intestinal barrier function using CRISPR/CAS9-created cell models</title><secondary-title>Cell and Bioscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell and Bioscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Chloride transport</keyword><keyword>Epithelial cell</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Intestinal epithelium</keyword><keyword>Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13578-019-0303-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Functional characterization of SLC26A3 c392C G p P131R mutation in intestinal barrier function using CRISPR CAS9 created cell models</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-019-0303-1</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>Background: Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD) in a newborn is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with life-threatening complications, requiring early diagnostics and treatment to prevent severe dehydration and infant mortality. SLC26A3 rs386833481 (c.392C&gt;G; p.P131R) gene polymorphism is an important genetic determinant of CCD. Here, we report the influence of the non-synonymous SLC26A3 variant rs386833481 gene polymorphism on the function of the epithelial barrier and the potential mechanisms of these effects. Results: We found that P131R-SLC26A3 increased dysfunction of the epithelial barrier compared with wild type SLC26A3 in human colonic Caco-2 and mouse colonic CMT-93 cells. When P131R-SLC26A3 was subsequently reverted to wild type, the epithelial barrier function was restored similar to wild type cells. Further study demonstrated that variant P131R-SLC26A3 disrupts function of epithelial barrier through two distinct molecular mechanisms: (a) decreasing SLC26A3 expression through a ubiquitination pathway and (b) disrupting a key interaction with its partner ZO-1/CFTR, thereby increasing the epithelial permeability. Conclusion: Our study provides an important insight of SLC26A3 SNPs in the regulation of the epithelial permeability and indicates that SLC26A3 rs386833481 is likely a causative mutation in the dysfunction of epithelial barrier of CCD, and correction of this SNP or increasing SLC26A3 function could be therapeutically beneficial for chronic diarrhea diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Mingzhen</author><author>Yang, Chunhua</author><author>Yan, Xiangji</author><author>Sung, Junsik</author><author>Garg, Pallavi</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Highly Biocompatible Functionalized Layer-by-Layer Ginger Lipid Nano Vectors Targeting P-selectin for Delivery of Doxorubicin to Treat Colon Cancer</title><secondary-title>Advanced Therapeutics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advanced Therapeutics</full-title></periodical><pages>1900129</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>determination</keyword><keyword>protein crystallography</keyword><keyword>protein data bank</keyword><keyword>r -factor</keyword><keyword>resolution</keyword><keyword>restraints</keyword><keyword>structure</keyword><keyword>structure interpretation</keyword><keyword>structure quality</keyword><keyword>structure refinement</keyword><keyword>structure validation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>2163684814</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/adtp.201900129</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Highly Biocompatible Functionalized Layer-by-Layer Ginger Lipid Nano Vectors Targeting P-selectin for Delivery of Doxorubicin to Treat Colon Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fadtp.201900129</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>A biocompatible natural nanoparticle drug delivery system that has specific cancer-targeting function holds vast promise for cancer therapy. Here, a fucoidan/poly-lysine-functionalized layer-by-layer ginger-derived lipid vector (LbL-GDLV) was designed to target P-selectin (overexpressed by endothelial cells) and deliver a loaded drug into vascularized colon cancer. In vitro, LbL-GDLVs selectively bound to P-selectin, and the degradation of the fucoidan outer layer in a milieu similar to the cancer microenvironment resulted in rapid attachment of the cancer cell and internalization of the remaining positively charged poly-lysine coated-GDLVs. Upon enzymolysis of the poly-lysine layer inside the cancer cell, the GDLV core released loaded doxorubicin (Dox) which had the expected effects. In vivo bio-distribution studies showed that intravenously injected LbL-GDLVs exhibited enhanced accumulation at the vascularized tumor site (~ 4.4-fold higher than control vesicles), presumably due to P-selectin-mediated targeting plus the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). In two animal models used to screen anti-cancer efficacy (Luc-HT-29 and HCT-116 xenografts), Dox-loaded LbL-GDLVs (LbL-GDLVs/Dox) significantly inhibited tumor growth and demonstrated much better therapeutic efficiency than free Dox. More importantly, LbL-GDLVs/Dox exhibited excellent biocompatibility, and LbL-GDLVs encapsulation largely reduced the cardiotoxicity of free Dox and avoided the notorious drug resistance of colon cells against free Dox. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of our newly designed and highly biocompatible plant-derived LbL nanoparticles and their precise colon cancer drug delivery function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Majolee, Jisca</author><author>Pronk, Manon CA</author><author>Jim, Kin K</author><author>van Bezu, Jan SM</author><author>van der Sar, Astrid M</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>Kovacevic, Igor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CSN5 inhibition triggers inflammatory signaling and Rho/ROCK-dependent loss of endothelial integrity</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-44595-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-44595-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>RhoGTPases regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, migration and cell-cell adhesion in endothelial cells. Besides regulation at the level of guanine nucleotide binding, they also undergo post-translational modifications, for example ubiquitination. RhoGTPases are ubiquitinated by Cullin RING ligases which are in turn regulated by neddylation. Previously we showed that inhibition of Cullin RING ligase activity by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 is detrimental for endothelial barrier function, due to accumulation of RhoB and the consequent induction of contractility. Here we analyzed the effect of pharmacological activation of Cullin RING ligases on endothelial barrier integrity in vitro and in vivo. CSN5i-3 induced endothelial barrier disruption and increased macromolecule leakage in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CSN5i-3 strongly induced the expression and activation of RhoB and to lesser extent of RhoA in endothelial cells, which enhanced cell contraction. Elevated expression of RhoGTPases was a consequence of activation of the NF-κB pathway. In line with this notion, CSN5i-3 treatment decreased IκBα expression and increased NF-κB-mediated ICAM-1 expression and consequent adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells. This study shows that sustained neddylation of Cullin RING-ligases leads to activation the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells, elevated expression of RhoGTPases, Rho/ROCK-dependent activation of MLC and disruption of the endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Chi</author><author>Yan, Qin</author><author>Zou, Quin-yun</author><author>Zhong, Xin-qi</author><author>Tyler, Chanel T</author><author>Magness, Ronald R</author><author>Bird, Ian M</author><author>Zheng, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sexual Dimorphisms of Preeclampsia-Dysregulated Transcriptomic Profiles and Cell Function in Fetal Endothelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Hypertension</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hypertension</full-title></periodical><pages>154-163</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fetal endothelial dysfunction</keyword><keyword>Preeclampsia</keyword><keyword>Sexual dimorphisms</keyword><keyword>Transcriptome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.118.12569</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sexual Dimorphisms of Preeclampsia-Dysregulated Transcriptomic Profiles and Cell Function in Fetal Endothelial Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.118.12569</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Preeclampsia impairs fetoplacental vascular function and increases risks of adult-onset cardiovascular disorders in children born to preeclamptic mothers, implicating that preeclampsia programs fetal vasculature in utero. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesize that preeclampsia alters fetal endothelial gene expression and disturbs cytokines- and growth factors-induced endothelial responses. RNAseq analysis was performed on unpassaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. Functional assays for endothelial monolayer integrity, proliferation, and migration were conducted on passage 1 HUVECs from normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. Compared with normotensive cells, 926 and 172 genes were dysregulated in unpassaged female and male HUVECs from preeclamptic pregnancies, respectively. Many of these preeclampsiadysregulated genes are associated with cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart failure) and endothelial function (e.g., cell migration, calcium signaling, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling). TNFα-, TGFβ1-, FGF2-, and VEGFA-regulated gene networks were differentially disrupted in unpassaged female and male HUVECs from preeclamptic pregnancies. Moreover, preeclampsia decreased endothelial monolayer integrity in responses to TNFα in both female and male HUVECs.

However, the specific molecules involved in meningitic E. coli-induced BBB breakdown and neuroinflammatory response remain unclear. Our previous RNA-sequencing data from human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) revealed two important host factors: platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which were significantly upregulated in hBMECs after meningitic E. coli infection. Whether and how PDGF-B and ICAM-1 contribute to the development of E. coli meningitis are still unclear. Methods: The western blot, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were applied to verify the significant induction of PDGF-B and ICAM-1 by meningitic E. coli in vivo and in vitro. Evan's blue assay and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing assay were combined to identify the effects of PDGF-B on BBB permeability. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology, cell-cell adhesion assay, and electrochemiluminescence assay were used to investigate the role of ICAM-1 in neuroinflammation subversion. Results: We verified the significant induction of PDGF-B and ICAM-1 by meningitic E. coli in mouse as well as monolayer hBMECs models. Functionally, we showed that the increase of PDGF-B may directly enhance the BBB permeability by decreasing the expression of tight junction proteins, and the upregulation of ICAM-1 contributed to neutrophils or monocytes recruitment as well as neuroinflammation subversion in response to meningitic E. coli infection. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated the roles of PDGF-B and ICAM-1 in mediating bacterial-induced BBB damage as well as neuroinflammation, providing new concepts and potential targets for future prevention and treatment of bacterial meningitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Lu</author><author>Li, Jixuan</author><author>Huo, Dong</author><author>Peng, Zhong</author><author>Yang, Ruicheng</author><author>Fu, Jiyang</author><author>Xu, Bojie</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Chen, Huanchun</author><author>Wang, Xiangru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meningitic escherichia coli induction of ANGPTL4 in brain microvascular endothelial cells contributes to blood–brain barrier disruption via arhgap5/rhoa/myl5 signaling cascade</title><secondary-title>Pathogens</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pathogens</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>ANGPTL4</keyword><keyword>ARHGAP5</keyword><keyword>BBB disruption</keyword><keyword>Bacterial meningitis</keyword><keyword>MYL5</keyword><keyword>RhoA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>8627872872</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/pathogens8040254</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Meningitic Escherichia coli Induction of ANGPTL4 in Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells Contributes to Blood Brain Barrier Disruption via ARHGAP5 RhoA MYL5 Signaling Cascade.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Bacterial meningitis is currently recognized as one of the most important life-threatening infections of the central nervous system (CNS) with high morbidity and mortality, despite the advancements in antimicrobial treatment. The disruption of blood–brain barrier (BBB) induced by meningitis bacteria is crucial for the development of bacterial meningitis. However, the complete mechanisms involving in the BBB disruption remain to be elucidated. Here, we found meningitic Escherichia coli induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) contributes to BBB disruption via ARHGAP5/RhoA/MYL5 signaling cascade, by the demonstration that ANGPTL4 was significantly upregulated in meningitis E. coli infection of BMECs as well as mice, and treatment of the recombinant ANGPTL4 protein led to an increased permeability of the BBB in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that ANGPTL4 did not affect the expression of tight junction proteins involved in BBB disruption, but it increased the expression of MYL5, which was found to have a negative role on the regulation of barrier function during meningitic E. coli infection, through the activation of RhoA signaling pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the disruption of BBB induced by ANGPTL4 through the ARHGAP5/RhoA/MYL5 pathway, which largely supports the involvement of ANGPTL4 during meningitic E. coli invasion and further expands the theoretical basis for the mechanism of bacterial meningitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durchschein, Franziska</author><author>Eherer, Andreas</author><author>Grill, Magdalena</author><author>Sturm, Eva M.</author><author>Pommer, Veronika</author><author>Langner, Cord</author><author>Högenauer, Christoph</author><author>Schicho, Rudolf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Involvement of EP2 and EP4 Receptors in Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Pilot Study</title><secondary-title>Digestive Diseases and Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Digestive Diseases and Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2806-2814</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>DP1</keyword><keyword>EP receptors</keyword><keyword>Eosinophils</keyword><keyword>Esophageal epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>Prostaglandin receptors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>30989466</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10620-019-05623-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Involvement of EP2 and EP4 Receptors in Eosinophilic Esophagitis A Pilot Study.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-019-05623-5</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: The prostaglandin D2 receptor DP2 has been implicated in eosinophil infiltration and the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Aims and Methods: In this study, we investigated an involvement of PGE2 (EP1–EP4) and PGD2 (DP1) receptors in EoE by measuring their expression in peripheral blood eosinophils and esophageal mucosal biopsies of EoE patients and by performing migration and adhesion assays with eosinophils from healthy donors. Results: Expression of EP2 and EP4, but not EP1 and EP3, was decreased in blood eosinophils of patients with EoE vs. control subjects. Adhesion of eosinophils to esophageal epithelial cells was decreased by EP2 receptor agonist butaprost and EP4 agonist ONO-AE1-329, whereas DP1 agonist BW245C increased adhesion. In chemotaxis assays with supernatant from human esophageal epithelial cells, only ONO-AE1-329 but not butaprost or BW245C inhibited the migration of eosinophils. Expression of EP and DP receptors in epithelial cells and eosinophils was detected in sections of esophageal biopsies from EoE patients by immunohistochemistry. qPCR of biopsies from EoE patients revealed that gene expression of EP4 and DP1 was the highest among PGE2 and PGD2 receptors. Esophageal epithelial cells in culture showed high gene expression for EP2 and EP4. Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors decreased barrier integrity of esophageal epithelial cells in impedance assays. Conclusions: Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors may inhibit eosinophil recruitment to the esophageal mucosa. However, their activation could negatively affect esophageal barrier integrity suggesting that eosinophilic rather than epithelial EP2 and EP4 have a protective role in EoE.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lago, Juliana Carvalhães</author><author>Puzzi, Maria Beatriz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of aging in primary human dermal fibroblasts</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0219165</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The effect of aging in primary human dermal fibroblasts.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Proliferation</label><abstract>Skin aging is a complex process, and alterations in human skin due to aging have distinct characteristic as compared to other organs. The aging of dermal cells and the biological mechanisms involved in this process are key areas to understand skin aging. A large number of biological mechanisms, such as decreasing of protein synthesis of extracellular matrix or increasing of degradation, are known to be altered through skin aging. However, environmental influence can accelerate this characteristic phenotype. In this study, we analyzed primary human dermal fibroblasts in three different in-vitro aging models—UVB irradiation and accelerated proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts from young donors as well as from elderly donors—for the gene expression of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL7A1, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8, MMP9, MMP10, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14, TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, TIMP4, IL1B, IL1A, IL6, IL8, IL10, PTGS2, TP53, CASP3, LMNA, SIRT1. We compared the gene expression levels with young control. Furthermore, the behavior of skin fibroblasts was also evaluated using cell growth rate. The findings reveal that the gene expression levels in skin fibroblasts was altered in the process of aging in all three in-vitro aging models, and the cell growth rate was reduced, suggesting that these methods can be employed to understand skin aging mechanisms as well as drug discovery screening method.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mostovenko, Ekaterina</author><author>Young, Tamara</author><author>Muldoon, Pretal P.</author><author>Bishop, Lindsey</author><author>Canal, Christopher G.</author><author>Vucetic, Aleksandar</author><author>Zeidler-Erdely, Patti C.</author><author>Erdely, Aaron</author><author>Campen, Matthew J.</author><author>Ottens, Andrew K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nanoparticle exposure driven circulating bioactive peptidome causes systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Carbon nanotubes</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>MMP</keyword><keyword>MWCNT</keyword><keyword>Mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Nanomaterial</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Peptidome</keyword><keyword>Thrombospondin</keyword><keyword>Vascular dysfunction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</publisher><accession-num>31142334</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12989-019-0304-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Nanoparticle Exposure Driven Circulating Bioactive Peptidome Causes Systemic Inflammation and Vascular Dysfunction.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background: The mechanisms driving systemic effects consequent pulmonary nanoparticle exposure remain unclear. Recent work has established the existence of an indirect process by which factors released from the lung into the circulation promote systemic inflammation and cellular dysfunction, particularly on the vasculature. However, the composition of circulating contributing factors and how they are produced remains unknown. Evidence suggests matrix protease involvement; thus, here we used a well-characterized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) oropharyngeal aspiration model with known vascular effects to assess the distinct contribution of nanoparticle-induced peptide fragments in driving systemic pathobiology. Results: Data-independent mass spectrometry enabled the unbiased quantitative characterization of 841 significant MWCNT-responses within an enriched peptide fraction, with 567 of these factors demonstrating significant correlation across animal-paired bronchoalveolar lavage and serum biofluids. A database search curated for known matrix protease substrates and predicted signaling motifs enabled identification of 73 MWCNT-responsive peptides, which were significantly associated with an abnormal cardiovascular phenotype, extracellular matrix organization, immune-inflammatory processes, cell receptor signaling, and a MWCNT-altered serum exosome population. Production of a diverse peptidomic response was supported by a wide number of upregulated matrix and lysosomal proteases in the lung after MWCNT exposure. The peptide fraction was then found bioactive, producing endothelial cell inflammation and vascular dysfunction ex vivo akin to that induced with whole serum. Results implicate receptor ligand functionality in driving systemic effects, exemplified by an identified 59-mer thrombospondin fragment, replete with CD36 modulatory motifs, that when synthesized produced an anti-angiogenic response in vitro matching that of the peptide fraction. Other identified peptides point to integrin ligand functionality and more broadly to a diversity of receptor-mediated bioactivity induced by the peptidomic response to nanoparticle exposure. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that pulmonary-sequestered nanoparticles, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes, acutely upregulate a diverse profile of matrix proteases, and induce a complex peptidomic response across lung and blood compartments. The serum peptide fraction, having cell-surface receptor ligand properties, conveys peripheral bioactivity in promoting endothelial cell inflammation, vasodilatory dysfunction and inhibiting angiogenesis. Results here establish peptide fragments as indirect, non-cytokine mediators and putative biomarkers of systemic health outcomes from nanoparticle exposure.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Triplett, Kathleen D.</author><author>Pokhrel, Srijana</author><author>Castleman, Moriah J.</author><author>Daly, Seth M.</author><author>Elmore, Bradley O.</author><author>Joyner, Jason A.</author><author>Sharma, Geetanjali</author><author>Herbert, Guy</author><author>Campen, Matthew J.</author><author>Hathaway, Helen J.</author><author>Prossnitz, Eric R.</author><author>Hall, Pamela R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GPER activation protects against epithelial barrier disruption by Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>30718654</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-37951-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GPER Activation Protects Against Epithelial Barrier Disruption by Staphylococcus Aureus α-Toxin.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37951-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Sex bias in innate defense against Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is dependent on both estrogen production by the host and S. aureus secretion of the virulence factor, α-hemolysin (Hla). The impact of estrogen signaling on the immune system is most often studied in terms of the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. However, the potential contribution of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) to innate defense against infectious disease, particularly with respect to skin infection, has not been addressed. Using a murine model of SSTI, we found that GPER activation with the highly selective agonist G-1 limits S. aureus SSTI and Hla-mediated pathogenesis, effects that were absent in GPER knockout mice. Specifically, G-1 reduced Hla-mediated skin lesion formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while increasing bacterial clearance. In vitro, G-1 reduced surface expression of the Hla receptor, ADAM10, in a human keratinocyte cell line and increased resistance to Hla-mediated permeability barrier disruption. This novel role for GPER activation in skin innate defense against infectious disease suggests that G-1 may have clinical utility in patients with epithelial permeability barrier dysfunction or who are otherwise at increased risk of S. aureus infection, including those with atopic dermatitis or cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gelsinger, Megan L.</author><author>Tupper, Laura L.</author><author>Matteson, David S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell Line Classification Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)</title><secondary-title>The International Journal of Biostatistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The International Journal of Biostatistics</full-title></periodical><volume>1557-4679</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1515/ijb-2018-0083</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading;Classification;Proliferation;modeling</label><abstract>We present new methods for cell line classification using multivariate time series bioimpedance data obtained from electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology. The ECIS technology, which monitors the attachment and spreading of mammalian cells in real time through the collection of electrical impedance data, has historically been used to study one cell line at a time. However, we show that if applied to data from multiple cell lines, ECIS can be used to classify unknown or potentially mislabeled cells, factors which have previously been associated with the reproducibility crisis in the biological literature. We assess a range of approaches to this new problem, testing different classification methods and deriving a dictionary of 29 features to characterize ECIS data. Most notably, our analysis enriches the current field by making use of simultaneous multi-frequency ECIS data, where previous studies have focused on only one frequency; using classification methods to distinguish multiple cell lines, rather than simple statistical tests that compare only two cell lines; and assessing a range of features derived from ECIS data based on their classification performance. In classification tests on fifteen mammalian cell lines, we obtain very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy. These preliminary findings provide a baseline for future large-scale studies in this field.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khalyfa, Abdelnaby</author><author>Gozal, David</author><author>Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasma Extracellular Vesicles in Children with OSA Disrupt Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity and Endothelial Cell Wound Healing in Vitro</title><secondary-title>International journal of molecular sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of molecular sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>electric cell–substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)</keyword><keyword>extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes</keyword><keyword>hCMEC/D3 cells</keyword><keyword>neurocognitive deficits</keyword><keyword>pediatric OSA</keyword><keyword>wound healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijms20246233</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Plasma Extracellular Vesicles in Children with OSA Disrupt Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity and Endothelial Cell Wound Healing in Vitro..pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (P-OSA) is associated with neurocognitive deficits and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting the possibility that disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may underlie these morbidities. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes, are small particles involved in cell-cell communications via different mechanisms and could play a role in OSA-associated end-organ injury. To examine the roles of EVs in BBB dysfunction, we recruited three groups of children: (a) absence of OSA or cognitive deficits (CL, n = 6), (b) OSA but no evidence of cognitive deficits (OSA-NC(-), n = 12), and (c) OSA with evidence of neurocognitive deficits (OSA-NC(+), n = 12). All children were age-, gender-, ethnicity-, and BMI-z-score-matched, and those with OSA were also apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)-matched. Plasma EVs were characterized, quantified, and applied on multiple endothelial cell types (HCAEC, HIAEC, human HMVEC-D, HMVEC-C, HMVEC-L, and hCMEC/D3) while measuring monolayer barrier integrity and wound-healing responses. EVs from OSA children induced significant declines in hCMEC/D3 transendothelial impedance compared to CL (p &lt; 0.001), and such changes were greater in NC(+) compared to NC(-) (p &lt; 0.01). The effects of EVs from each group on wound healing for HCAEC, HIAEC, HMVED-d, and hCMEC/D3 cells were similar, but exhibited significant differences across the three groups, with evidence of disrupted wound healing in P-OSA. However, wound healing in HMVEC-C was only affected by NC(+) (p &lt; 0.01 vs. NC(-) or controls (CO). Furthermore, no significant differences emerged in HMVEC-L cell wound healing across all three groups. We conclude that circulating plasma EVs in P-OSA disrupt the integrity of the BBB and exert adverse effects on endothelial wound healing, particularly among OSA-NC(+) children, while also exhibiting endothelial cell type selectivity. Thus, circulating EVs cargo may play important roles in the emergence of end-organ morbidity in pediatric OSA.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iwakura, Takamasa</author><author>Marschner, Julian A.</author><author>Zhao, Zhi Bo</author><author>Swiderska, Monika K.</author><author>Anders, Hans-joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing in kidney research</title><secondary-title>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><keywords><keyword>acute kidney injury</keyword><keyword>cell culture</keyword><keyword>chronic kidney</keyword><keyword>disease</keyword><keyword>stem cells</keyword><keyword>technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/ndt/gfz191</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing in kidney research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Review;Theory</label><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a quanti- tative, label-free, non-invasive analytical method allowing continuous monitoring of the behaviour of adherent cells by online recording of transcellular impedance.

To this end, we cultured ARPE-19 cells on Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) multi-well arrays. Using an ad hoc light emitting diode (LED) ar- ray illumination system together with a set of neutral density filters and a 3-dimensional (3D) printed filter holder, cells were exposed to a gradient of irradiances of blue-light with a measured peak at 468 nm. The electrical resistance between 4 kHz and 64 kHz was recorded during the exposure. Blue light exposure induced a dose-dependent decrease in the resistances at 4 kHz, however the time course resistance at 64 kHz did not show any decrease before t = 52 h. Quantification of the barrier function using math- ematical model integrated in the ECIS software showed that blue-light ex- posure induced a dose-dependent decrease in the barrier function associat- ed with tight junction formation (P &lt; 0.05). This was confirmed by the immunostaining of the tight-junction associated structural protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The detection of reactive oxygen species by carboxy- H2DCFDA confirmed that the blue light induced dose-dependent decrease in the barrier function is mediated by oxidative stress. On a separate exper- iment, blue-light exposed ARPE-19 cells were treated with 100 nM Pro- tein Kinase C zeta (PKC-ζ) pseudo substrate inhibitor to identify underly- ing pathway for blue-light induced damage on the barrier function. The treatment with 100 nM PKC-ζ pseudo substrate inhibitor induced faster re- covery of the barrier function compared to no treatment. Altogether our re- sults document that blue LED light exposure decreased RPE barrier func- tion in-vitro in a dose-dependent manner, before any cell death occurred. This damage induced by blue-light on tight junctions is mediated by oxida- tive stress through PKC-ζ activation. The quantification of the healing ef- fect observed by inhibition of PKC-ζ might lead to development of high throughput wound healing assays through ECIS in the future</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stolwijk, J A</author><author>Skiba, M</author><author>Kade, C</author><author>Bernhardt, G</author><author>Buschauer, A</author><author>Hübner, H</author><author>Gmeiner, P</author><author>Wegener, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increasing the throughput of label-free cell assays to study the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors by using a serial agonist exposure protocol</title><secondary-title>Integrative Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Integrative Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>99-108</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press (OUP)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/intbio/zyz010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Stolwijk et al. - 2019 - Increasing the throughput of label-free cell assays to study the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors by u.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cavallini, F.</author><author>Tarantola, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECIS based wounding and reorganization of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in co-cultures</title><secondary-title>Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>116-127</pages><volume>144</volume><keywords><keyword>Cardiomyocytes</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>Impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Wound healing assay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.06.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ECIS based wounding and reorganization of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in co-cultures.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.06.010</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The crosstalk of two major heart cell groups, cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, relies on direct electromechanical cellular coupling as well as indirect mechanical signal transmission through the surrounding viscoelastic extracellular matrix. Upon injury of cardiac tissue, this communication becomes unbalanced: fibrosis is initiated leading to increased collagen deposition, accompanied by an activation of fibroblasts – the key players of fibrosis. They undergo a reorganization or partial transformation to myofibroblasts during this process, which precedes scar formation within the infarcted heart in vivo. Here, we induce wound formation in an in vitro system as a model for these fibrotic conditions: we assessed the dynamics of wound healing in co-cultures of fibroblasts and myocytes upon targeted wound initiation using Electric Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) under optical control. We discovered distinct wound closure dynamics for mono- and co-cultures of myocytes and fibroblasts and observed a cessation of the contractile behavior for recovering cardiomyocyte cultures. We furthermore identified a change of cellular impedance for recovering fibroblasts and the presence of α-SMA, suggesting a partial transformation into myofibroblasts. This was concomitant with a modulation of connectivity, cell-substrate dynamics and membrane capacitance of all wounded cell cultures. Qualitatively, connexin 43 observation confirmed the ECIS trend found for cell-cell connectivity. Finally, we were able to validate the ECIS based wounding approach against an ECIS based barrier assay – the so-called electric fence. In particular the cell-cell connectivity and thus cell layer integrity dominates the healing dynamics within the two intrinsically different assays.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiu, Sheng-Po</author><author>Lee, Yu-Wei</author><author>Wu, Ling-Yi</author><author>Tung, Tse-Hua</author><author>Gomez, Sofia</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Wang, Jia-Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of ECIS to Assess FCCP-Induced Changes of MSC Micromotion and Wound Healing Migration</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><pages>3210</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>4-</keyword><keyword>carbonyl cyanide</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>fccp</keyword><keyword>hmscs</keyword><keyword>human mesenchymal stem cells</keyword><keyword>micromotion</keyword><keyword>mitochondria</keyword><keyword>phenylhydrazone</keyword><keyword>trifluoromethoxy</keyword><keyword>wound healing migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s19143210</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Application of ECIS to Assess FCCP-Induced Changes.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Micromotion;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an emerging technique for sensitively monitoring morphological changes of adherent cells in tissue culture. In this study, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were exposed to different concentrations of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) for 20 h and their subsequent concentration-dependent responses in micromotion and wound healing migration were measured by ECIS. FCCP disrupts ATP synthesis and results in a decrease in cell migration rates. To detect the change of cell micromotion in response to FCCP challenge, time-series resistances of cell-covered electrodes were monitored and the values of variance were calculated to verify the difference. While Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer can detect the effect of FCCP at 3 μM concentration, the variance calculation of the time-series resistances measured at 4 kHz can detect the effect of FCCP at concentrations as low as 1 μM. For wound healing migration, the recovery resistance curves were fitted by sigmoid curve and the hill slope showed a concentration-dependent decline from 0.3 μM to 3 μM, indicating a decrease in cell migration rate. Moreover, dose dependent incline of the inflection points from 0.3 μM to 3 μM FCCP implied the increase of the half time for wound recovery migration. Together, our results demonstrate that partial uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation reduces micromotion and wound healing migration of hMSCs. The ECIS method used in this study offers a simple and sensitive approach to investigate stem cell migration and its regulation by mitochondrial dynamics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hedayatipour, Ava</author><author>Aslanzadeh, Shaghayegh</author><author>McFarlane, Nicole</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CMOS based whole cell impedance sensing: Challenges and future outlook</title><secondary-title>Biosensors and Bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors and Bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>111600</pages><volume>143</volume><issue>June</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological cells</keyword><keyword>CMOS sensor</keyword><keyword>Cell based sensing</keyword><keyword>Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Electrical impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Impedance sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2019.111600</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CMOS based whole cell impedance sensing Challenges and future outlook.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956566319306797</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review;Theory</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drieschner, Carolin</author><author>Vo, Nguyen T.

The recently developed epithelial barrier model of the fish intestine relies on the RTgutGC cell line from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), cultured in inserts on permeable membranes. Our aim was to extend the current system by introducing intestinal fibroblasts as supportive layer in order to reconstruct the epithelial-mesenchymal interface as found in vivo. We therefore initiated and characterized the first fibroblast cell line from the intestine of rainbow trout, which has been termed RTgutF. Co-culture studies of RTgutGC and RTgutF were performed on commercially available electric cell substrate for impedance sensing (ECIS) and on newly developed ultrathin, highly porous alumina membranes to imitate the cellular interaction with the basement membrane. Cellular events were examined with non-invasive impedance spectroscopy to distinguish between barrier tightness and cell density in the ECIS system and to determine transepithelial electrical resistance for cells cultured on the alumina membranes. We highlight the relevance of the piscine intestinal fibroblasts for an advanced intestinal barrier model, particularly on ultrathin alumina membranes. These membranes enable rapid crosstalk of cells cultured on opposite sides, which led to increased barrier tightening in the fish cell line-based epithelial-mesenchymal model.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leo, Luciana M.</author><author>Familusi, Boluwatife</author><author>Hoang, Michelle</author><author>Smith, Raymond</author><author>Lindenau, Kristen</author><author>Sporici, Kevin T.</author><author>Brailoiu, Eugen</author><author>Abood, Mary E.</author><author>Brailoiu, G.

Despite extensive research, mechanisms leading to AAA formation and advancement are still poorly understood. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) are predominant in the aortic medial layer and maintain the wall structure. Apoptosis of SMC is a well-known phenomenon in the pathophysiology of AAA. However, remaining SMC function is less extensively studied. The aim of this study is to assess the in vitro contractility of human AAA and non-pathologic aortic SMC. Biopsies were perioperatively harvested from AAA patients (n = 21) and controls (n = 6) and clinical data were collected. Contractility was measured using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) upon ionomycin stimulation. Additionally, SMC of 23% (5 out of 21) of AAA patients showed impaired maximum contraction compared to controls. Also, SMC from patients who underwent open repair after earlier endovascular repair and SMC from current smokers showed decreased maximum contraction vs. controls (p = 0.050 and p = 0.030, respectively). Our application of ECIS can be used to study contractility in other vascular diseases. Finally, our study provides with first proof that impaired SMC contractility might play a role in AAA pathophysiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glioblastoma, U- M G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing to Investigate the Cytotoxic Effects of Andrographolide on U-87 MG Glioblastoma Cell Migration and Apoptosis</title><secondary-title>Sensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><issue>2275</issue><keywords><keyword>andrographolide</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>glioblastoma</keyword><keyword>suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid</keyword><keyword>temozolomide</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Application of Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing to Investigate the Cytotoxic Eﬀects of Andrographolide on U-87 MG Glioblastoma Cell Migration and Apoptosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>apoptosis;barrier function;cytotoxicity;migration;wound healing</label><abstract>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. In recent studies, the efficacy of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been investigated for GBM.We explored the effects of two exploratory compounds, the histone deacetylase SAHA and the natural product andrographolide, on Uppsala 87 Malignant Glioma (U-87 MG) cell migration and viability in comparison with the clinically used therapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ). We used the electric cell–substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system to monitor the migration of U-87 MG cells after treatment with various concentrations of these compounds. Moreover, we used the Alamar blue assay and western blotting to observe the concentration-dependent changes in the viability and apoptosis of U-87 MG cells. Our results demonstrated that both SAHA and andrographolide (10–300 µM) significantly inhibited GBM cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner, and 10 µM SAHA and 56 µM andrographolide demonstrated remarkable inhibitory effects on U-87 MG migration. Western blotting indicated that compared with TMZ, both SAHA and andrographolide induced higher expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, such as caspase-3, BAX, and PARP in U-87 MG cells. Furthermore, all three drugs downregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. In conclusion, SAHA and andrographolide showed exceptional results in inhibiting cell migration and motility. The ECIS wound healing assay is a powerful technique to identify and screen potential therapeutic agents that can inhibit cancer cell migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anchan, Akshata</author><author>Kalogirou-baldwin, Panagiota</author><author>Johnson, Rebecca</author><author>Kho, Dan T</author><author>Joseph, Wayne</author><author>Hucklesby, James</author><author>Finlay, Graeme J</author><author>Carroll, Simon J O</author><author>Angel, Catherine E</author><author>Graham, E Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time Measurement of Melanoma Cell-Mediated Human Brain Endothelial Barrier Disruption Using Sensing Technology</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>56</issue><keywords><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>6409923694</isbn><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Real-Time Measurement of Melanoma Cell-Mediated Human Brain Endothelial Barrier Disruption Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Technology.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Invasion</label><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an impedance-based method for monitoring changes in cell behaviour in real-time. In this paper, we highlight the importance of ECIS in measuring the kinetics of human melanoma cell invasion across human brain endothelium. ECIS data can be mathematically modelled to assess which component of the endothelial paracellular and basolateral barriers is being affected and when. Our results reveal that a range of humanmelanoma cells can mediate disruption of human brain endothelium, primarily involving the paracellular route, as demonstrated by ECIS. The sensitivity of ECIS also reveals that the paracellular barrier weakens within 30–60 min of the melanoma cells being added to the apical face of the endothelial cells. Imaging reveals pronounced localisation of the melanoma cells at the paracellular junctions consistent with paracellular migration. Time-lapse imaging further reveals junctional opening and disruption of the endothelial monolayer by the invasive melanoma cells all within several hours. We suggest that the ability of ECIS to resolve changes to barrier integrity in real time, and to determine the route of migration, provides a powerful tool for future studies investigating the key molecules involved in the invasive process of cancer cells</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Juan</author><author>Lu, Xiangjun</author><author>Chen, Bin</author><author>Cai, Enqi</author><author>Liu, Wenli</author><author>Jiang, Jinxiao</author><author>Chen, Feifei</author><author>Shan, Xiaodong</author><author>Zhang, Hangjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of silver nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in rat tracheal epithelial cells</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Toxicological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Toxicological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>155-165</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Japanese Society of Toxicology</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2131/jts.44.155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tang et al. - 2019 - Mechanisms of silver nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in rat tracheal epithelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Cytotoxicity</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morgan, Katie</author><author>Martucci, Nicole</author><author>Kozlowska, Ada</author><author>Gamal, Wesam</author><author>Brzeszczynki, Fillip</author><author>Treskes, Philipp</author><author>Samuel, Kay</author><author>Hayes, Peter</author><author>Nelson, Lenny</author><author>Bagnaninchi, Pierre</author><author>Brzeszczynska, Joanna</author><author>Plevris, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chlorpromazine toxicity is associated with disruption of cell membrane integrity and initiation of a pro-inflammatory response in the HepaRG hepatic cell line</title><secondary-title>Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1408-1416</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptive response</keyword><keyword>Cell membrane</keyword><keyword>Chlorpromazine</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>HepaRG</keyword><keyword>Impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Pro-inflammatory</keyword><keyword>Tight junctions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biopha.2019.01.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Chlorpromazine toxicity is associated with disruption of cell membrane integrity and initiation of a pro-inflammatory response in the HepaRG hepatic cell line.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2019.01.020</url></web-urls></urls><label>cytotoxicity;modeling</label><abstract>Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a neuroleptic drug and prototype compound used to study intrahepatic cholestasis. The exact mechanisms of CPZ induced cholestasis remain unclear. Rat hepatocytes, or a sandwich culture of rat and human hepatocytes, have been the most commonly used models for studying CPZ toxicity in vitro. However, to better predict outcomes in pre-clinical trials where cholestasis may be an unwanted consequence, a human in vitro model, based on human HepaRG cells, capable of real-time, non-invasive and label free monitoring, alongside molecular investigations would be beneficial. To address this we used the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and established concentrations of CPZ ranging from sub-toxic, 25 μM and 50 μM, to toxic 100 μM and compared them with untreated control. To assess the effect of this range of CPZ concentrations we employed electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to measure viability and cell membrane interactions alongside traditional viability assays, immunocytostaining and qRT-PCR to assess genes of interest within adaptive and inflammatory pathways. Using these methods, we show a concentration dependant response to CPZ involving pro-inflammatory pathway, loss of tight junctions and membrane integrity, and an adaptive response mediated by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activation and up-regulation of membrane phospholipid and xenobiotic transporters. In conclusion, structural changes within the membrane caused by sub-toxic and toxic concentrations of CPZ negatively impact the function of the cellular membrane. Damage to efflux transport proteins caused by CPZ induce cholestasis alongside downstream inflammation, which activates compensatory responses for cell survival. Lay summary: Chlorpromazine is a drug used to treat patients with schizophrenia, which has a known association with liver damage. Here we show that it causes inflammation and alters the cell membranes in liver and bile duct cells similar to what is seen within a human population. The initiation of the inflammatory response and changes to cellular structure may provide insight into the damage and disease process and inform medical treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, Yi-Ting</author><author>Chu, Yeh-Shiu</author><author>Lo, Jun-Chih</author><author>Hung, Yu-Han</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of electrode diameter on the detection sensitivity and frequency characteristics of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</title><secondary-title>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</full-title></periodical><pages>707-715</pages><volume>288</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)</keyword><keyword>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)</keyword><keyword>Electrode size</keyword><keyword>MDA-MB-231</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity</keyword><keyword>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)</keyword><keyword>eis</keyword><keyword>electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/J.SNB.2019.02.098</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Eﬀects of electrode diameter on the detection sensitivity and frequency characteristics of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing .pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400519303223?via%3Dihub</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory;Migration</label><abstract>Cell-based electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has emerged as a label-free approach to monitor whole cellular behavior in response to the environmental stimuli in real time. The measured impedance is strongly dependent on the attached cells, the sensing electrode size, and the constriction resistance between the sensing electrode and its counter electrode. However, determining the optimal electrode size for sensitive detection of impedance characteristics of the attached cells remains a challenge. In this study, four different cell lines (MDCK, MCF-7, HUVEC, and MDA-MB-231 cells) were cultured on the sensing electrodes with four different diameters, 250, 100, 50, and 25 μm, and impedance measurements were performed at frequencies ranging from 25 Hz to 64 kHz using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) method. As the diameter of sensing electrode decreases, the peak value (optimal detection sensitivity) of the normalized resistance spectrum decreases and the peak position (optimal detection frequency) shifts to the high-frequency region. These criteria were applied to sensitively measure impedance changes of MDA-MB-231 cells in response to TGF-β1 treatment. The transient increase of measured impedance after TGF-β1 treatment coincided with the augmented formation of the peripheral paxillin-rich sites and the increased cell migration rate, while little difference in cell spreading area was observed. Our results suggest that 250 μm is approximately the optimal electrode diameter for EIS measurement if sensitively monitoring the morphological changes of adherent cells is required.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rath, Anca</author><author>Eichhorn, Michael</author><author>Träger, Katharina</author><author>Paulsen, Friedrich</author><author>Hampel, Ulrike</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro effects of benzalkonium chloride and prostaglandins on human meibomian gland epithelial cells</title><secondary-title>Annals of Anatomy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Anatomy</full-title></periodical><pages>129-138</pages><volume>222</volume><keywords><keyword>Benzalkonium chloride</keyword><keyword>Meibomian gland</keyword><keyword>Prostaglandins</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier GmbH.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aanat.2018.12.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In vitro effects of benzalkonium chloride and prostaglandins on human meibomian gland epithelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2018.12.003</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Proliferation</label><abstract>Purpose: Benzalkonium chloride is the most widely used preservative in ophthalmic topical solutions. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of BAC as a single substance or as a component of several commercially available ophthalmic solutions on meibomian gland epithelial cells in vitro. Materials and methods: An immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cell line (HMGEC) was used and cells were cultured in the absence or presence of fetal bovine serum to assess cell morphology, cell proliferation, cell viability (MTS assay) and impedance sensing (ECIS) after stimulation with BAC. Further, the viability of HMGECs stimulated with BAC-containing and BAC-free bimatoprost, travoprost and latanoprost was evaluated using the MTS assay. Real-time PCR analysis for hyperkeratinization associated genes (cornulin, involucrin) was performed. Results: In the absence of serum, the proliferation rate of HMGECs decreased starting with 0.1 μg/ml BAC. At concentrations of 50 μg/ml BAC and higher, cell viability was reduced after 10 min exposure with a corresponding change in cell morphology. Toxicity of BAC-containing ophthalmic solutions was greater than that of BAC alone, whereas BAC-free alternative products did not significantly influence cell viability. Confluence, cell-cell contacts and serum-containing medium appeared to facilitate HMGECs survival. Expression rate of involucrin and cornulin declined after exposure to preserved bimatoprost and BAC. Conclusions: BAC showed cytotoxic effects on HMGECs starting with a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. The combination of BAC and prostaglandin-analogs might have a synergistic effect which results in higher toxicity than BAC alone. Unpreserved eye drops and eye drops preserved with Polyquaternium-1 are less damaging to HMGECs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gong, Haoli</author><author>Derbigny, Wilbert A.</author><author>Seye, Cheikh I.</author><author>Kumar, Ramesh</author><author>Liu, Luyao</author><author>Ramos-Solis, Nicole</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TLR3 deficiency exacerbates the loss of epithelial barrier function during genital tract Chlamydia muridarum infection</title><secondary-title>Plos One</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plos One</full-title></periodical><pages>e0207422</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0207422</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TLR3 deficiency exacerbates the loss of epithelial barrier function during genital tract Chlamydia muridarum infection.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Inflammation</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dennhardt, Sophie</author><author>Finke, Karl R.</author><author>Huwiler, Andrea</author><author>Coldewey, Sina M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes barrier-stabilizing effects in human microvascular endothelial cells via AMPK-dependent mechanisms</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Basis of Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Basis of Disease</full-title></periodical><pages>0-1</pages><issue>December 2018</issue><keywords><keyword>AMP-dependent kinase</keyword><keyword>Barrier breakdown</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>Endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine-1-phosphate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.12.022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes barrier-stabilizing eﬀects in human microvascular endothelial cells via AMPK-dependent mechanisms.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.12.022</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Breakdown of the endothelial barrier is a critical step in the development of organ failure in severe inflammatory conditions such as sepsis. Endothelial cells from different tissues show phenotypic variations which are often neglected in endothelial research. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) have been shown to protect the endothelium and phosphorylation of AMPK by S1P was shown in several cell types. However, the role of the S1P-AMPK interrelationship for endothelial barrier stabilization has not been investigated. To assess the role of the S1P-AMPK signalling axis in this context, we established an in vitro model allowing real-time monitoring of endothelial barrier function in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) and murine glomerular endothelial cells (GENCs) with the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS™) system. Following the disruption of the cell barrier by co-administration of LPS, TNF-α IL-1ß IFN-γ and IL–6, we demonstrated self-recovery of the disrupted barrier in HMEC-1, while the barrier remained compromised in GENCs. Under physiological conditions we observed a rapid phosphorylation of AMPK in HMEC-1 stimulated with S1P, but not in GENCs. Consistently, S1P enhanced the basal endothelial barrier in HMEC-1 exclusively. siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK in HMEC-1 led to a less pronounced barrier enhancement. Thus we present evidence for a functional role of AMPK in S1P-mediated barrier stabilization in HMEC-1 and we provide insight into cell-type specific differences of the S1P-AMPK-interrelationship, which might influence the development of interventional strategies targeting endothelial barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Juan</author><author>Lu, Xiangjun</author><author>Chen, Bin</author><author>Cai, Enqi</author><author>Liu, Wenli</author><author>Jiang, Jinxiao</author><author>Chen, Feifei</author><author>Shan, Xiaodong</author><author>Zhang, Hangjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of silver nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in rat tracheal epithelial cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Toxicological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Toxicological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>155-165</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>Oxidative stress</keyword><keyword>Rat tracheal epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>Silver nanoparticles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2131/jts.44.155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tang et al. - 2019 - Mechanisms of silver nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in rat tracheal epithelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.2131/jts.44.155</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Cytotoxicity</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Derada Troletti, Claudio</author><author>Fontijn, Ruud D.</author><author>Gowing, Elizabeth</author><author>Charabati, Marc</author><author>van Het Hof, Bert</author><author>Didouh, Imad</author><author>van der Pol, Susanne M.A.</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>Prat, Alexandre</author><author>van Horssen, Jack</author><author>Kooij, Gijs</author><author>de Vries, Helga E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inflammation-induced endothelial to mesenchymal transition promotes brain endothelial cell dysfunction and occurs during multiple sclerosis pathophysiology</title><secondary-title>Cell Death and Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Death and Disease</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41419-018-1294-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Inflammation-induced endothelial to mesenchymal transition promotes brain endothelial dysfunction and occurs during multiple sclerosis pathophysiology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41419-018-1294-2</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier;Inflammation</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mouton, Alan J.</author><author>Ma, Yonggang</author><author>Rivera Gonzalez, Osvaldo J.</author><author>Daseke, Michael J.</author><author>Flynn, Elizabeth R.</author><author>Freeman, Tom C.</author><author>Garrett, Michael R.</author><author>DeLeon-Pennell, Kristine Y.</author><author>Lindsey, Merry L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fibroblast polarization over the myocardial infarction time continuum shifts roles from inflammation to angiogenesis</title><secondary-title>Basic Research in Cardiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Basic Research in Cardiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Cardiac remodeling</keyword><keyword>Extracellular matrix</keyword><keyword>Fibroblast</keyword><keyword>Myocardial infarction</keyword><keyword>Transcriptome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><isbn>0123456789</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00395-019-0715-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Fibroblast polarization over the myocardial infarction time continuum.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00395-019-0715-4</url></web-urls></urls><label>Inflammation;Migration</label><abstract>Cardiac fibroblasts are the major producers of extracellular matrix (ECM) to form infarct scar. We hypothesized that fibro- blasts undergo a spectrum of phenotype states over the course of myocardial infarction (MI) from early onset to scar forma- tion. Fibroblasts were isolated from the infarct region of C57BL/6J male mice (3–6 months old, n = 60) at days 0 (no MI control) and 1, 3, or 7 after MI. Whole transcriptome analysis was performed by RNA-sequencing. Of the genes sequenced, 3371 were differentially expressed after MI. Enrichment analysis revealed that MI day 1 fibroblasts displayed pro-inflam- matory, leukocyte-recruiting, pro-survival, and anti-migratory phenotype through Tnfrsf9 and CD137 signaling. MI day 3 fibroblasts had a proliferative, pro-fibrotic, and pro-angiogenic profile with elevated Il4ra signaling. MI day 7 fibroblasts showed an anti-angiogenic homeostatic-like myofibroblast profile and with a step-wise increase in Acta2 expression. MI day 7 fibroblasts relied on Pik3r3 signaling to mediate Tgfb1 effects and Fgfr2 to regulate PI3K signaling. In vitro, the day 3 MI fibroblast secretome stimulated angiogenesis, while day 7 MI fibroblast secretome repressed angiogenesis through Thbs1 signaling. Our results reveal novel mechanisms for fibroblasts in expressing pro-inflammatory molecules and regulating angiogenesis following MI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pronk, Manon C</author><author>Majolee, Jisca</author><author>Loregger, Anke</author><author>van Bezu, Jan S.M.</author><author>Zelcer, Noam</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L.</author><author>Kovacevic, Igor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FBXW7 regulates endothelial barrier function by suppression of the cholesterol synthesis pathway and prenylation of RhoB Manon</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FBXW7 regulates endothelial barrier function by suppression of the cholesterol.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Rho GTPases control both the actin cytoskeleton and adherens junction stability and are recognized as essential regulators of endothelial barrier function. They act as molecular switches and are primarily regulated by the exchange of GDP and GTP. However, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, prenylation, and ubiquitination can additionally alter their localization, stability, and activity. F-box proteins are involved in the recognition of substrate proteins predestined for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Given the importance of ubiquitination, we studied the effect of the loss of 62 members of the F-box protein family on endothelial barrier function in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier function was quantified by electrical cell impedance sensing and macromolecule passage assay. Our RNA interference–based screen identified FBXW7 as a key regulator of endothelial barrier function. Mechanistically, loss of FBXW7 induced the accumulation of the RhoB GTPase in endothelial cells, resulting in their increased contractility and permeability. FBXW7 knockdown induced activation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and changed the prenylation of RhoB. This effect was reversed by farnesyl transferase inhibitors and by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In summary, this study identifies FBXW7 as a novel regulator of endothelial barrier function in vitro. Loss of FBXW7 indirectly modulates RhoB activity via alteration of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and, consequently, of the prenylation status and activity of RhoB, resulting in increased contractility and disruption of the endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alwhaibi, Abdulrahman</author><author>Somanath, Payaningal R.</author><author>Hafez, Sherif</author><author>Gao, Fei</author><author>Ergul, Adviye</author><author>Verma, Arti</author><author>Sabbineni, Harika</author><author>Artham, Sandeep</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial stromelysin1 regulation by the forkhead box-O transcription factors is crucial in the exudative phase of acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>Pharmacological Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmacological Research</full-title></periodical><pages>249-263</pages><volume>141</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>ARDS</keyword><keyword>Akt1</keyword><keyword>Claudin5</keyword><keyword>FoxO</keyword><keyword>Lung injury</keyword><keyword>MMP3</keyword><keyword>Stromelysin1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.phrs.2019.01.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Endothelial stromelysin1 regulation by the forkhead box-O transcription.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2019.01.006</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nickol, Michaela E.</author><author>Ciric, Justine</author><author>Falcinelli, Shane D.</author><author>Chertow, Daniel S.</author><author>Kindrachuk, Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of Host and Bacterial Contributions to Lung Barrier Dysfunction Following Co-infection with 2009 Pandemic Influenza and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>2009 pandemic</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus aureus</keyword><keyword>alveolar epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>co-infection</keyword><keyword>influenza</keyword><keyword>kinome</keyword><keyword>virulence factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v11020116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Characterization of Host and Bacterial Contributions.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Virology</label><abstract>Influenza viruses are a threat to global public health resulting in ~500,000 deaths each year. Despite an intensive vaccination program, influenza infections remain a recurrent, yet unsolved public health problem. Secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate influenza infections during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is frequently associated with these co-infections, including the 2009 influenza pandemic. Damage to alveolar epithelium is a major contributor to severe influenza-bacterial co-infections and can result in gas exchange abnormalities, fluid leakage, and respiratory insufficiency. These deleterious manifestations likely involve both pathogen- and host-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms (pathogen- and/or host-mediated) underlying influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis. To address this, we characterized the contributions of viral-, bacterial-, and host-mediated factors to the altered structure and function of alveolar epithelial cells during co-infection with a focus on the 2009 pandemic influenza (pdm2009) and MRSA. Here, we characterized pdm2009 and MRSA replication kinetics, temporal host kinome responses, modulation of MRSA virulence factors, and disruption of alveolar barrier integrity in response to pdm2009-MRSA co-infection. Our results suggest that alveolar barrier disruption during co-infection is mediated primarily through host response dysregulation, resulting in loss of alveolar barrier integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valle, Maria L.</author><author>Dworshak, Janine</author><author>Sharma, Ashok</author><author>Ibrahim, Ahmed S.</author><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author><author>Sharma, Shruti</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of interleukin-6 trans-signaling prevents inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption in retinal endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Experimental Eye Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Eye Research</full-title></periodical><pages>27-36</pages><volume>178</volume><issue>September 2018</issue><keywords><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-6</keyword><keyword>Trans-signaling</keyword><keyword>sgp130</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2018.09.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Inhibition of interleukin-6 trans-signaling prevents inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption in retinal endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2018.09.009</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Inflammation</label><abstract>Vascular inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Recently, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) has emerged as a prominent regulator of inflammation in endothelial cells. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that selective inhibition of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway will attenuate inflammation and subsequent barrier disruption in retinal endothelial cells. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were exposed to IL-6 and sIL-6R to induce IL-6 trans-signaling and the commercially available compound sgp130Fc (soluble gp-130 fused chimera) was used to selectively inhibit IL-6 trans-signaling. IL-6 trans-signaling activation caused a significant increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, expression of adhesion molecules, ROS production and apoptosis in HRECs whereas a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and NO production was observed in IL-6 trans-signaling activated cells. These changes were not observed in cells pre-treated with sgp130Fc. IL-6 trans-signaling activation was sufficient to cause barrier disruption in endothelial monolayers and pre-treatment of HRECs with sgp130Fc, maintained endothelial barrier function similar to that of untreated cells. Thus, in conclusion, these results indicate that IL-6 trans-signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, apoptosis and barrier disruptive effects in the retinal endothelial cells and inhibition of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway using sgp130-Fc attenuates vascular inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brolih, Sanja</author><author>Parks, Scott K.</author><author>Vial, Valérie</author><author>Durivault, Jérôme</author><author>Mostosi, Livio</author><author>Pouysségur, Jacques</author><author>Pagès, Gilles</author><author>Picco, Vincent</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AKT1 restricts the invasive capacity of head and neck carcinoma cells harboring a constitutively active PI3 kinase activity</title><secondary-title>BMC Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AKT/PKB</keyword><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Invasion</keyword><keyword>Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Migration</keyword><keyword>Phenotypic screening</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BMC Cancer</publisher><accession-num>29506489</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12885-018-4169-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4169-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment/Spreading</label><abstract>Background: In mammals, the AKT/PKB protein kinase family comprises three members (AKT1-3). PI3-Kinase (PI3K), a key oncogene involved in a wide variety of cancers, drives AKT activity. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been associated with tumorigenic properties including uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, promotion of cellular motility, invasiveness and metastasis. However, AKT1 activity has also been recently shown to repress the invasive properties of breast cancer cells in specific contexts. Methods: This study used both pharmacological and shRNA approaches to inhibit AKT function, microscopy to characterize the cellular morphology, 3D spheroid models to assess migratory and invasive cellular capacities and a phenotypic screening approach based on electrical properties of the cells. Results: Here we demonstrate that the alternative action of AKT1 on invasive properties of breast cancers can be extended to head and neck carcinomas, which exhibit constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed, inhibition of AKT1 function by shRNA or a specific pharmacological inhibitor resulted in cellular spreading and an invasive phenotype. A phenotypic screening approach based on cellular electrical properties corroborated microscopic observations and provides a foundation for future high-throughput screening studies. This technique further showed that the inhibition of AKT1 signaling is phenocopied by blocking the mTORC1 pathway with rapamycin. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the repressive action of PI3K/AKT1 on cellular invasive properties may be a mechanism common to several cancers. Current and future studies involving AKT inhibitors must therefore consider this property to prevent metastases and consequently to improve survival.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, C.

Trauma can prime the PMN nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex for an enhanced respiratory burst, but the relative role of various priming agents in this process remains incompletely understood. We therefore set out to identify mediators of PMN priming during coagulation and trauma-shock and determine whether PMN reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in this manner could influence organ injury and coagulation. Initial experiments demonstrated that PMN are primed for predominantly extracellular ROS production by products of coagulation, which was abrogated by CD88/C5a receptor(C5aR) inhibition. The importance of this was highlighted further by demonstrating that known PMN priming agents result in fractionally different amounts of extracellular versus intracellular ROS release depending on the agent used. Plasma from trauma patients in haemodynamic shock (n = 10) also primed PMN for extracellular ROS in a C5a-dependent manner, which correlated with both complement alternative pathway activation and thrombin generation. Furthermore, PMN primed by preincubation with products of blood coagulation directly caused loss of endothelial barrier function in vitro that was abrogated by C5aR blockade or NADPH oxidase inhibition. Finally, we show in a murine model of trauma-shock that p47phox knock-out (KO) mice with PMN incapable of generating ROS were protected from inflammatory end-organ injury and activated protein C-mediated coagulopathy. In summary, we demonstrate that trauma-shock and coagulation primes PMN for predominantly extracellular ROS production in a C5a-dependent manner that contributes to endothelial barrier loss and organ injury, and potentially enhances traumatic coagulopathy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaer, Christian A.</author><author>Owczarek, Catherine</author><author>Deuel, Jeremy W.</author><author>Schauer, Stefan</author><author>Baek, Jin Hyen</author><author>Yalamanoglu, Ayla</author><author>Hardy, Matthew P.</author><author>Scotney, Pierre D.</author><author>Schmidt, Peter M.</author><author>Pelzing, Matthias</author><author>Soupourmas, Peter</author><author>Buehler, Paul W.</author><author>Schaer, Dominik J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phenotype-specific recombinant haptoglobin polymers co-expressed with C1r-like protein as optimized hemoglobin-binding therapeutics</title><secondary-title>BMC Biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BMC Biotechnology</publisher><accession-num>29544494</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12896-018-0424-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Phenotype-specific recombinant haptoglobin polymers co-expressed with C1r-like protein as optimized hemoglobin-binding therapeutics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12896-018-0424-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: Preclinical studies have evaluated haptoglobin (Hp) polymers from pooled human plasma as a therapeutic protein to attenuate toxic effects of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb). Proof of concept studies have demonstrated efficacy of Hp in hemolysis associated with transfusion and sickle cell anemia. However, phenotype-specific Hp products might be desirable to exploit phenotype specific activities of Hp 1-1 versus Hp 2-2, offering opportunities for recombinant therapeutics. Prohaptoglobin (proHp) is the primary translation product of the Hp mRNA. ProHp is proteolytically cleaved by complement C1r subcomponent-like protein (C1r-LP) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Two main allelic Hp variants, HP1 and HP2 exist. The larger HP2 is considered to be the ancestor variant of all human Hp alleles and is characterized by an α2-chain, which contains an extra cysteine residue that pairs with additional α-chains generating multimers with molecular weights of 200-900 kDa. The two human HP1 alleles (HP1F and HP1S) differ by a two-amino-acid substitution polymorphism within the α-chain and are derived from HP2 by recurring exon deletions. Results: In the present study, we describe a process for the production of recombinant phenotype specific Hp polymers in mammalian FS293F cells. This approach demonstrates that efficient expression of mature and fully functional protein products requires co-expression of active C1r-LP. The functional characterization of our proteins, which included monomer/polymer distribution, binding affinities as well as NO-sparing and antioxidant functions, demonstrated that C1r-LP-processed recombinant Hp demonstrates equal protective functions as plasma derived Hp in vitro as well as in animal studies. Conclusions: We present a recombinant production process for fully functional phenotype-specific Hp therapeutics. The proposed process could accelerate the development of Hb scavengers to treat patients with cell-free Hb associated disease states, such as sickle cell disease and other hemolytic conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gu, Andrea Y.</author><author>Kho, Dan T.</author><author>Johnson, Rebecca H.</author><author>Scott Graham, E.</author><author>O’Carroll, Simon J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro wounding models using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-Zθ technology</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Brain endothelium</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>Wound-healing assay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios8040090</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In Vitro Wounding Models Using the Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)-Zθ Technology.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) can produce reproducible wounding models by mechanically disrupting a cell monolayer. This study compared in vitro wound-healing using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMVEC) with both single electrode (8W1E) and multiple electrodes (8W10E+) arrays. Measurements of hCMVEC migration and barrier functions were conducted, revealing variable levels of barrier disruption could be achieved by altering the duration and magnitude of the applied current. In all scenarios, the barrier (Rb) did not recover the strength observed prior to injury. Localization of junctional proteins following wounding were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Following wounding, cell migration was generally faster on the 8W10E+ than the 8W1E array. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed non-viable cells remained on the 8W1E electrodes but not the 8W10E+ electrodes. However, viable cells partially remained on the 8W10E+ electrodes following wounding. In addition, the 8W10E+ electrodes demonstrated variation in cell loss across electrodes within the same well. This suggests the type of wounding is different on the two array types. However, our data show both arrays can be used to model incomplete barrier recovery and therefore both have potential for testing of drugs to improve endothelial barrier function. This is the first time that the possibility of using the 8W10E+ array as a wounding model is addressed. We highlight the differences in wounding produced between the two arrays, and can be used to study the underlying causes for impaired barrier function following CNS injuries.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Wen Tong</author><author>Lv, Yu Jin</author><author>Yang, Rui Cheng</author><author>Fu, Ji Yang</author><author>Liu, Lu</author><author>Wang, Huan</author><author>Cao, Qi</author><author>Tan, Chen</author><author>Chen, Huan Chun</author><author>Wang, Xiang Ru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New insights into meningitic Escherichia coli infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells from quantitative proteomics analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>BMECs</keyword><keyword>Blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>Meningitic E. coli</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword><keyword>iTRAQ</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Journal of Neuroinflammation</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12974-018-1325-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://New insights into meningitic Escherichia coli infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells from quantitative proteomics analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Background: Bacterial meningitis remains a big threat to the integrity of the central nervous system (CNS), despite the advancements in antimicrobial reagents. Escherichia coli is a bacterial pathogen that can disrupt the CNS function, especially in neonates. E. coli meningitis occurs after bacteria invade the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that form a direct and essential barrier restricting the entry of circulating microbes and toxins to the brain. Previous studies have reported on several cellular proteins that function during meningitic E. coli infections; however, more comprehensive investigations to elucidate the potential targets involved in E. coli meningitis are essential to better understand this disease and discover new treatments for it. Methods: The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach coupled with LC-MS/MS were applied to compare and characterize the different proteomic profiles of BMECs in response to meningitic or non-meningitic E. coli strains. KEGG and gene ontology annotations, ingenuity pathways analysis, and functional experiments were combined to identify the key host molecules involved in the meningitic E. coli-induced tight junction breakdown and neuroinflammatory responses. Results: A total of 13 cellular proteins were found to be differentially expressed by meningitic E. coli strains PCN033 and RS218, including one that was also affected by HB101, a non-meningitic E. coli strain. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), granzyme A, NF-κB signaling, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways as being biologically involved in the meningitic E. coli-induced tight junction breakdown and neuroinflammation. Functionally, we showed that MIF facilitated meningitic E. coli-induced production of cytokines and chemokines and also helped to disrupt the blood-brain barrier by decreasing the expression of tight junction proteins like ZO-1, occludin. Moreover, we demonstrated the significant activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling in BMECs in response to meningitic E. coli strains, which dominantly determined the generation of the proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Conclusions: Our work identified 12 host cellular targets that are affected by meningitic E. coli strains and revealed MIF to be an important contributor to meningitic E. coli-induced cytokine production and tight junction disruption, and also the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways that are mainly involved in the infection-induced cytokines production. Characterization of these distinct proteins and pathways in BMECs will facilitate further elucidation of meningitis-causing mechanisms in humans and animals, thereby enabling the development of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies against infection with meningitic E. coli.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kugelmann, Daniela</author><author>Rotkopf, Lukas Thomas</author><author>Radeva, Mariya Yosifova</author><author>Garcia-Ponce, Alexander</author><author>Walter, Elias</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histamine causes endothelial barrier disruption via Ca2+-mediated RhoA activation and tension at adherens junctions</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><isbn>4159801831408</isbn><accession-num>30185878</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-31408-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Histamine causes endothelial barrier disruption via Ca2+-mediated RhoA activation and tension at adherens junctions.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-31408-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER</label><abstract>During inflammation, the disruption of the endothelial barrier leads to increased microvascular permeability. Whether tension along cell junctions contributes to histamine-induced endothelial barrier disruption remains unknown. Rapid Ca2+ influx induced by both histamine and thrombin was accompanied by endothelial barrier breakdown revealed as drop of transendothelial electric resistance in primary human microvascular endothelial cells. Interestingly, GLISA measurements revealed activation of RhoA but not inactivation of Rac1 at the time-point of barrier breakdown. FRET measurements showed activation of RhoA at intercellular junctions after both thrombin and histamine exposure. Breakdown coincided with increased stress fiber formation but not with translocation of vinculin, which was located along junctions in the resting state similar to postcapillary venules ex vivo. Moreover, increased tension at AJs was indicated by immunostaining with a conformation-sensitive antibody targeting the α18-subunit of α-catenin. Ca2+ chelation by BAPTA-AM and ROCK1 inhibition by Y27632 abolished both increase of tension along AJs as well as barrier dysfunction. Moreover, BAPTA-AM decreased RhoA activation following histamine stimulation, indicating a key role of Ca2+ signaling in barrier breakdown. Taken together, in response to histamine, Ca2+ via RhoA/ROCK activation along endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) appears to be critical for barrier disruption and presumably correlated with enhanced tension. However, vinculin appears not to be critical in this process.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rafikova, Olga</author><author>Williams, Elissa R.</author><author>McBride, Matthew L.</author><author>Zemskova, Marina</author><author>Srivastava, Anup</author><author>Nair, Vineet</author><author>Desai, Ankit A.</author><author>Langlais, Paul R.</author><author>Zemskov, Evgeny</author><author>Simon, Marc</author><author>Mandarino, Lawrence J.</author><author>Rafikov, Ruslan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hemolysis-induced lung vascular leakage contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>334-345</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Edema</keyword><keyword>Endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>Heme</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobin</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary arterial hypertension</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>0000000159</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2017-0308OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Hemolysis-induced Lung Vascular Leakage Contributes to the Development of Pulmonary Hypertension..pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Although hemolytic anemia-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are more common than the prevalence of idiopathic PAH alone, the role of hemolysis in the development of PAH is poorly characterized. We hypothesized that hemolysis independently contributes to PAH pathogenesis via endothelial barrier dysfunction with resulting perivascular edema and inflammation. Plasma samples from patients with and without PAH (both confirmed by right heart catheterization) were used to measure free hemoglobin (Hb) and its correlation with PAH severity. A sugen (50 mg/kg)/hypoxia (3 wk)/normoxia (2 wk) rat model was used to elucidate the role of free Hb/heme pathways in PAH. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were used to study heme-mediated endothelial barrier effects. Our data indicate that patients with PAH have increased levels of free Hb in plasma that correlate with PAH severity. There is also a significant accumulation of free Hb and depletion of haptoglobin in the rat model. In rats, perivascular edema was observed at early time points concomitant with increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. Heme-induced endothelial permeability in human lung microvascular endothelial cells involved activation of the p38/HSP27 pathway. Indeed, the rat model also exhibited increased activation of p38/HSP27 during the initial phase of PH. Surprisingly, despite the increased levels of hemolysis and heme-mediated signaling, there was no heme oxygenase-1 activation. This can be explained by observed destabilization of HIF-1a during the first 2 weeks of PH regardless of hypoxic conditions. Our data suggest that hemolysis may play a significant role in PAH pathobiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Xudong</author><author>Jang, Sunghoon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The application of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) biosensors</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>260-261</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>biosensor</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>toxicity analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.15406/ijbsbe.2018.04.00136</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://the application of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) biosensors.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Theory</label><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a label-free and non-invasive technique for analyzing the activities and morphologies of cells.

A novel mathematical model is proposed to analyze the distribution of electric potential and current of ECIS. This mathematical model is validated by experimental data and can be used to illustrate a quantitative relationship between cell impedance and cellular parameters including cell thickness and radius and membrane capacitance and cytoplasm resistivity. This model is useful to optimize the dimension of ECIS electrodes in order to satisfy various applications. The detection sensitivity of ECIS sensors is analyzed by the mathematical model and experimental data. The simulated and experimental results show that ECIS sensors with smaller radius of working electrodes yield higher impedance values, which improve signal-to-noise ratio. The distances between the working and counter electrodes within a range from 1.0 mm to 3.5 mm do not influence the impedance measurements. However, that distance should not be too small, in order to prevent the current from directly bypassing the cells between the electrodes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, Denise R.</author><author>Wang, Chunyan</author><author>Patel, Rehka</author><author>Trujillo, Andrea</author><author>Patel, Niketa A.</author><author>Prather, Jamie</author><author>Gould, Lisa J.</author><author>Wu, Mack H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Conditioned Media and Exosomes Containing MALAT1 Promote Human Dermal Fibroblast Migration and Ischemic Wound Healing</title><secondary-title>Advances in Wound Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Wound Care</full-title></periodical><pages>299-308</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Mary Ann Liebert Inc</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/wound.2017.0775</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Objective: Chronically ill patients heal recalcitrant ulcerative wounds more slowly. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) play an important role in tissue regeneration and exosomes secreted by hADSC contribute to their paracrine signaling. In addition to cytokines, lipids and growth factors, hADSC secrete mRNA, miRNA, and long noncoding (lnc) RNA into exosomes. In this study we examined the role of lncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), an abundant lncRNA in exosomes from conditioned media (CM), on cell migration and ischemic wound healing. Approach: CM and isolated exosomes from hADSC were applied to human dermal fibroblast (HDF) in scratch assays and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assays. CM was also applied to a rat model of ischemic wound healing and wound closure was followed. Results: CM stimulated cell migration of HDFs in vitro by 48%. CM stimulated the closure of ischemic wounds in a rat model 50% faster than unconditioned media. The depletion of MALAT1 in adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) CM significantly reduced cell migration. Since MALAT1 is secreted into exosomes, a purified population of exosomes was applied to HDF where they enhanced cell migration in a similar manner to FGF-2 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in ECIS wound healing assays. The uptake of exosomes by HDF was shown using dynasore, an inhibitor that blocks clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Depletion of MALAT1 in hADSC with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in exosomes without MALAT1. These exosomes had an effect similar to the unconditioned, control media in ECIS assays. Innovation: Exosomes contain lncRNA MALAT1 and other factors that have the potential to stimulate HDF cell migration and angiogenesis involved in wound healing without applying stem cells to wounds. Conclusion: Our results show the potential of using topically applied ADSC-derived exosomes containing MALAT1 for treating ischemic wounds. This allows for harnessing the power of stem cell paracrine signaling capabilities without applying the cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Voiculescu, Ioana</author><author>Toda, Masaya</author><author>Inomata, Naoki</author><author>Ono, Takahito</author><author>Li, Fang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nano and Microsensors for Mammalian Cell Studies</title><secondary-title>Micromachines</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Micromachines</full-title></periodical><pages>439</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/mi9090439</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Voiculescu et al. - 2018 - Nano and Microsensors for Mammalian Cell Studies.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory</label><abstract>This review presents several sensors with dimensions at the nano- and micro-scale used for biological applications. Two types of cantilever beams employed as highly sensitive temperature sensors with biological applications will be presented. One type of cantilever beam is fabricated from composite materials and is operated in the deflection mode. In order to achieve the high sensitivity required for detection of heat generated by a single mammalian cell, the cantilever beam temperature sensor presented in this review was microprocessed with a length at the microscale and a thickness in the nanoscale dimension. The second type of cantilever beam presented in this review was operated in the resonant frequency regime. The working principle of the vibrating cantilever beam temperature sensor is based on shifts in resonant frequency in response to temperature variations generated by mammalian cells. Besides the cantilever beam biosensors, two biosensors based on the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) used to monitor mammalian cells attachment and viability will be presented in this review. These ECIS sensors have dimensions at the microscale, with the gold films used for electrodes having thickness at the nanoscale. These micro/nano biosensors and their mammalian cell applications presented in the review demonstrates the diversity of the biosensor technology and applications.</abstract></record><record><database

Uraemia induces endothelial cell (EC) injury and impaired repair capacity, for which the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Active vitamin D (VD) may promote endothe-lial repair, however, the mechanism that mediates the effects of VD in chronic kidney disease are poorly understood. Thus, we investigated uraemia-induced endothelial damage and the pro-tection against such damage by active VD. Methods. We applied electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to study real-time responses of human ECs exposed to pooled uraemic and non-uraemic plasma with or without the addition of active VD. The effects of indoxyl sulphate and p-cre-sol were tested in non-uraemic plasma. Structural changes for vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and F-actin were assessed by immunostaining and quantified. Results. The exposure of ECs to uraemic media significantly de-creased endothelial barrier function after 24 h. Cell migration after electrical wounding and recovery of the barrier after thrombin-induced loss of integrity were significantly impaired in uraemic-medium stimulated cells and cells exposed to indoxyl sulphate and p-cresol. This effect on ECIS was dependent on loss of cell–cell interaction. Mechanistically, we found that EC, ex-posed to uraemic media, displayed disrupted VE-cadherin inter-actions and F-actin reorganization. VD supplementation rescued both endothelial barrier function and cell–cell interactions in ECs exposed to uraemic media. These events were associated with an increment of VE-cadherin at intercellular junctions. Conclusions. Our data demonstrate a potentially clinically rele-vant mechanism for uraemia-induced endothelial damage. Furthermore, active VD rescued the uraemic medium-induced loss of cell–cell adhesion, revealing a novel role of active VD in preservation of endothelial integrity during uraemia.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiang, Nan</author><author>Riley, Ian R.</author><author>Dalli, Jesmond</author><author>Rodriguez, Ana R.</author><author>Spur, Bernd W.</author><author>Serhan, Charles N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration pathway counters leukotriene D 4 –stimulated vascular responses</title><secondary-title>The FASEB Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>4043-4052</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.201701493R</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.fasebj.org/doi/10.1096/fj.201701493R</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alma, L.J.</author><author>De Groot, C.J.M.</author><author>De Menezes, R.X.</author><author>Hermes, W.</author><author>Hordijk, P.L.</author><author>Kovačević, I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial dysfunction as a long-term effect of late onset hypertensive pregnancy disorders: High BMI is key</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Obstetrics &amp;

However, a critical issue to be addressed before widespread hASC clinical translation is the dramatic variability in proliferative capacity and osteogenic potential among hASCs isolated from different donors. The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that electrical cell-substrate impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) could track complex bioimpedance patterns of hASCs throughout proliferation and osteogenic differentiation to better understand and predict variability among hASC populations. Superlots composed of hASCs from young (aged 24–36 years), middle-aged (aged 48–55 years), and elderly (aged 60–81 years) donors were seeded on gold electrode arrays. Complex impedance measurements were taken throughout proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. During osteogenic differentiation, four impedance phases were identified: increase, primary stabilization, drop phase, and secondary stabilization. Matrix deposition was first observed 48–96 hours after the impedance maximum, indicating, for the first time, that ECIS can identify morphological changes that correspond to late-stage osteogenic differentiation. The impedance maximum was observed at day 10.0 in young, day 6.1 in middle-aged, and day 1.3 in elderly hASCs, suggesting that hASCs from younger donors require a longer time to differentiate than do hASCs from older donors, but young hASCs proliferated more and accreted more calcium long-term. This is the first study to use ECIS to predict osteogenic potential of multiple hASC populations and to show that donor age may temporally control onset of osteogenesis. These findings could be critical for development of patient-specific bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazzoni, Jenna</author><author>Smith, Julian R.</author><author>Shahriar, Sanjid</author><author>Cutforth, Tyler</author><author>Ceja, Bernardo</author><author>Agalliu, Dritan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Wnt Inhibitor Apcdd1 Coordinates Vascular Remodeling and Barrier Maturation of Retinal Blood Vessels</title><secondary-title>Neuron</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuron</full-title></periodical><pages>1055-1069.e6</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Apcdd1</keyword><keyword>Caveolin-1</keyword><keyword>Claudin-5</keyword><keyword>Frizzled-4</keyword><keyword>Norrin</keyword><keyword>Occludin</keyword><keyword>Wnt/β-catenin signaling</keyword><keyword>angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>blood-retina barrier</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword><keyword>transcytosis</keyword><keyword>vascular pruning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>29154126</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neuron.2017.10.025</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.10.025</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Coordinating angiogenesis with acquisition of tissue-specific properties in endothelial cells is essential for vascular function. In the retina, endothelial cells form a blood-retina barrier by virtue of tight junctions and low transcytosis. While the canonical Norrin/Fz4/Lrp5/6 pathway is essential for angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and barrier maturation, how these diverse processes are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Apcdd1, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, is expressed in retinal endothelial cells during angiogenesis and barrier formation. Apcdd1-deficient mice exhibit a transient increase in vessel density at ages P10–P12 due to delayed vessel pruning. Moreover, Apcdd1 mutant endothelial cells precociously form the paracellular component of the barrier. Conversely, mice that overexpress Apcdd1 in retina endothelial cells have reduced vessel density but increased paracellular barrier permeability. Apcdd1 thus serves to precisely modulate Wnt/Norrin signaling activity in the retinal endothelium and coordinate the timing of both vascular pruning and barrier maturation. How Wnt signaling coordinates vascular remodeling and barrier maturation in the retina is poorly understood. Mazzoni et al. demonstrate that mice lacking Apcdd1 exhibit decreased vessel pruning and precocious formation of the blood-retina barrier. Conversely, Apcdd1 overexpression in endothelial cells induces the opposite phenotype. Apcdd1 precisely sculpts Wnt activity to coordinate vascular pruning and barrier maturation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frugtniet, Bethan A.</author><author>Martin, Tracey A.</author><author>Zhang, Lijian</author><author>Jiang, Wen G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (nWASP) is implicated in human lung cancer invasion</title><secondary-title>BMC Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Invasion</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>NWASP</keyword><keyword>Wiskostatin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>BMC Cancer</publisher><accession-num>28351346</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12885-017-3219-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (nWASP) is implicated in human lung cancer invasion.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers with survival much lower in patients diagnosed with distal metastases. It is therefore imperative to identify pathways involved in lung cancer invasion and metastasis and to consider the therapeutic potential of agents that can interfere with these molecular pathways. This study examines nWASP expression in human lung cancer tissues and explores the effect of nWASP inhibition and knockdown on lung cancer cell behaviour. Methods: QPCR has been used to measure nWASP transcript expression in human lung cancer tissues. The effect of wiskostatin, an nWASP inhibitor, on A-549 and SK-MES-1 lung carcinoma cell growth, adhesion, migration and invasion was also examined using several in vitro functional assays, including ECIS, and immunofluorescence staining. The effect of nWASP knockdown using siRNA on particular behaviours of lung cancer cells was also examined. Results: Patients with high levels of nWASP expression in tumour tissues have significantly lower survival rates. nWASP transcript levels were found to correlate with lymph node involvement (p = 0.042). nWASP inhibition and knockdown was shown to significantly impair lung cancer cell growth. nWASP inhibition also affected other cell behaviours, in SK-MES-1 invasion and A-549 cell motility, adhesion and migration. Paxillin and FAK activity are reduced in lung cancer cell lines following wiskostatin and nWASP knockdown as shown by immunofluorescence and western blot. Conclusions: These findings highlight nWASP as an important potential therapeutic target in lung cancer invasion and demonstrate that inhibiting nWASP activity using the inhibitor wiskostatin can significantly alter cell behaviour in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skaria, Tom</author><author>Bachli, Esther</author><author>Schoedon, Gabriele</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wnt5A/Ryk signaling critically affects barrier function in human vascular endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Cell Adhesion and Migration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Adhesion and Migration</full-title></periodical><pages>24-38</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Wnt5A</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>systemic inflammation</keyword><keyword>vascular permeability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><accession-num>27159116</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19336918.2016.1178449</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Wnt5A Ryk signaling critically affects barrier function in human vascular endothelial cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336918.2016.1178449</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Satisfactory therapeutic strategies for septic shock are still missing. Previously we found elevated levels of Wnt5A in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Wnt5A is released by activated macrophages but knowledge of its effects in the vascular system remains scant. Here we investigate the response of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) to Wnt5A. We used a genome-wide differential expression approach to define novel targets regulated by Wnt5A. Gene ontology analysis of expression profiles revealed clusters of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling as the predominant targets of Wnt5A. Wnt5A targeted Rho-associated protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK), leading to phosphorylation of LIM kinase-2 (LIMK2) and inactivation of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin-1 (CFL1). Functional experiments recording cytoskeletal rearrangements in living cells showed that Wnt5A enhanced stress fiber formation as a consequence of reduced actin depolymerization. The antagonist Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) that specifically interferes with the WIF domain of Ryk receptors prevented actin polymerization. Wnt5A disrupted β-catenin and VE-cadherin adherens junctions forming inter-endothelial gaps. Functional experiments targeting the endothelial monolayer integrity and live recording of trans-endothelial resistance revealed enhanced permeability of Wnt5A-treated HCAEC. Ryk silencing completely prevented Wnt5A-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Wnt5A decreased wound healing capacity of HCAEC monolayers; this was restored by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Here we show that Wnt5A acts on the vascular endothelium causing enhanced permeability through Ryk interaction and downstream ROCK/LIMK2/CFL1 signaling. Wnt5A/Ryk signaling might provide novel therapeutic strategies to prevent capillary leakage in systemic inflammation and septic shock.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pennington, Matthew R.</author><author>Van de Walle, Gerlinde R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing To Monitor Viral Growth and Study Cellular Responses to Infection with Alphaherpesviruses in Real Time</title><secondary-title>mSphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>mSphere</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>alphaherpesvirus</keyword><keyword>antiviral agents</keyword><keyword>cellular kinetics in real</keyword><keyword>changes in the electrical</keyword><keyword>culture dish plated</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>formed in a tissue</keyword><keyword>genome editing</keyword><keyword>growth kinetics</keyword><keyword>impedance of a circuit</keyword><keyword>impedance-based</keyword><keyword>is a label-free</keyword><keyword>lectric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>measurement of the</keyword><keyword>method used to study</keyword><keyword>time and relies on</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/msphere.00039-17</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing To Monitor Viral Growth and Study Cellular Responses to Infection with Alphaherpesviruses in Real Time.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00039-17</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Growth;Proliferation;Virology</label><abstract>Alphaherpesviruses, including those that commonly infect humans, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, typically infect and cause cellular damage to epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces, leading to disease. The development of novel technologies to study the cellular responses to infection may allow a more complete understanding of virus replication and the creation of novel antiviral therapies. This study demonstrates the use of ECIS to study various aspects of herpesvirus biology, with a specific focus on changes in cellular morphology as a result of infection. We conclude that ECIS represents a valuable new tool with which to study alphaherpesvirus infections in real time and in an objective and reproducible manner.Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measures changes in an electrical circuit formed in a culture dish. As cells grow over a gold electrode, they block the flow of electricity and this is read as an increase in electrical impedance in the circuit. ECIS has previously been used in a variety of applications to study cell growth, migration, and behavior in response to stimuli in real time and without the need for cellular labels. Here, we demonstrate that ECIS is also a valuable tool with which to study infection by alphaherpesviruses. To this end, we used ECIS to study the kinetics of cells infected with felid herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1), a close relative of the human alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2, and compared the results to those obtained with conventional infectivity assays. First, we demonstrated that ECIS can easily distinguish between wells of cells infected with different amounts of FHV-1 and provides information about the cellular response to infection. Second, we found ECIS useful in identifying differences between the replication kinetics of recombinant DsRed Express2-labeled FHV-1, created via CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, and wild-type FHV-1. Finally, we demonstrated that ECIS can accurately determine the half-maximal effective concentration of antivirals. Collectively, our data show that ECIS, in conjunction with current methodologies, is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor viral growth and study the cellular response to alphaherpesvirus infection. IMPORTANCE Alphaherpesviruses, including those that commonly infect humans, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2, typically infect and cause cellular damage to epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces, leading to disease. The development of novel technologies to study the cellular responses to infection may allow a more complete understanding of virus replication and the creation of novel antiviral therapies. This study demonstrates the use of ECIS to study various aspects of herpesvirus biology, with a specific focus on changes in cellular morphology as a result of infection. We conclude that ECIS represents a valuable new tool with which to study alphaherpesvirus infections in real time and in an objective and reproducible manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schramm, Robert A.</author><author>Koslow, Matthew H.</author><author>Nelson, Deirdre A.</author><author>Larsen, Melinda</author><author>Castracane, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel impedance biosensor for measurement of trans-epithelial resistance in cells cultured on nanofiber scaffolds</title><secondary-title>Biosensors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Barrier function</keyword><keyword>Epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>Impedance</keyword><keyword>Nanofibers</keyword><keyword>Non-destructive testing</keyword><keyword>Salivary gland</keyword><keyword>Scaffold</keyword><keyword>Trans-epithelial electrical resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1518437869</isbn><accession-num>28858219</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/bios7030035</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://A Novel Impedance Biosensor for Measurement of Trans-Epithelial Resistance in Cells Cultured on Nanofiber Scaffolds.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;TEER;Theory</label><abstract>Nanofibrous scaffolds provide high surface area for cell attachment, and resemble the structure of the collagen fibers which naturally occur in the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. A label free and non-destructive method of assessing the interaction of cell tissue and scaffolds aids in the ability to discern the effective quality and magnitude of any scaffold modifications. Impedance cell spectroscopy is a biosensing method that employs a functional approach to assessing the cell monolayer. The electrical impedance barrier function of a cell monolayer represents the level of restriction to diffusion of charged species between all adjacent cells across an entire contiguous cellular monolayer. The impedance signals from many individual paracellular pathways contribute to the bulk measurement of the whole monolayer barrier function. However, the scaffold substrate must be entirely porous in order to be used with electrochemical cell impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) and cells must be closely situated to the electrodes. For purposes of evaluating cell-scaffold constructs for tissue engineering, non-invasive evaluation of cell properties while seeded on scaffolds is critical. A Transwell-type assay makes a measurement across a semi-permeable membrane, using electrodes placed on opposing sides of the membrane immersed in fluid. It was found that by suspending a nanofiber scaffold across a Transwell aperture, it is possible to integrate a fully functional nanofiber tissue scaffold with the ECIS Transwell apparatus. Salivary epithelial cells were grown on the nanofiber scaffolds and tight junction formation was evaluated using ECIS measurements in parallel with immunostaining and confocal imaging. The trans-epithelial resistance increased coordinate with cell coverage, culminating with a cell monolayer, at which point the tight junction proteins assemble and strengthen, reaching the peak signal. These studies demonstrate that ECIS can be used to evaluate tight junction formation in cells grown on nanofiber scaffolds and on effects of scaffold conditions on cells, thus providing useful biological feedback to inform superior scaffold designs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tóth, Gábor</author><author>Szöllősi, János</author><author>Vereb, György</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitating ADCC against adherent cells: Impedance-based detection is superior to release, membrane permeability, or caspase activation assays in resolving antibody dose response</title><secondary-title>Cytometry Part A</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cytometry Part A</full-title></periodical><pages>1021-1029</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity</keyword><keyword>PI/CFSE</keyword><keyword>PanToxiLux</keyword><keyword>adherent cell</keyword><keyword>cytometric ADCC assay</keyword><keyword>impedance-based cell analyzer</keyword><keyword>nonradioactive ADCC assay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cyto.a.23247</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Quantitating ADCC Against Adherent Cells Impedance-Based Detection is Superior to Release, Membrane Permeability, or Caspase Activation Assays in Resolving Antibody Dose Response.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>attachment;cytotoxicity</label><abstract>© 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. Monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapeutics will dominate Pharma's next generation of blockbuster drugs, and Fc-associated functions, including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) are among the highly desired activities mediated by these antibodies. Therefore, quantitative evaluation of ADCC is required during drug development. Our objective was to find the most suitable and reliable nonradioactive method for quantitative analysis of in vitro ADCC against adherent cells, which often serve as models for solid tumors. The test system was comprised the HER2 positive JIMT-1 cells targeted by the specific therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and pertuzumab (Perjeta ® ). These cells are resistant to the direct biological effects of these antibodies, and, therefore, allow the isolated assessment of ADCC. We compared fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) release as a fluorescent alternative to 51 Cr release; propidium iodide (PI) uptake revealing increased membrane permeability; the PanToxiLux assay measuring ADCC induced pro-apoptotic protease activity in flow cytometry; and an impedance-based real time cell adhesion test. We found that release assays are compromised by high spontaneous release of the label. PI uptake could not differentiate well between spontaneous NK activity and specific ADCC. The PanToxiLux assay, besides allowing for shorter assay times, offers improvement over the previous approaches in distinguishing spontaneous and antibody mediated NK action, but, probably owed to the prolonged detached state of adherent target cells, only at highly saturating antibody concentrations. In the case of adherent target cells, impedance-based cell analysis attains functional information exclusively on the target cells without having to label them for distinguishing from effectors or assay readout. It also allows continuous monitoring for days, and specifically detects target cell detachment, as the final functional consequence of ADCC. The sensitivity of this method even allows for quantitating the additivity and saturability of ADCC as a function of antibody concentration. We conclude that impedance-based assays are the most sensitive for quantitatively assessing in vitro ADCC on adherent target cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kho, Dan Ting</author><author>Johnson, Rebecca</author><author>Robilliard, Laverne</author><author>du Mez, Elyce</author><author>McIntosh, Julie</author><author>O’Carroll, Simon J.</author><author>Angel, Catherine E.</author><author>Graham, E.

However, the mechanism of how α 2 β 1 integrin regulates the differentiation and proliferation of myofibroblasts in cardiac fibrosis through fibrillar collagen (FC) remains uncertain. We established that FC mimicked the 3-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibroblasts from post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients in vivo. This allowed us to explore the differentiation and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on FC. Here, we report that low expression of α 2 β 1 integrin increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation and α -smooth muscle actin ( α -SMA) expression. This occurred due to the instability of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in myofibroblasts on FC. We also demonstrated that FC reduced protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) activity of myofibroblasts, which was coincident with low α 2 β 1 integrin expression and activation of AKT, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK). In addition, knock-down of both β 1 integrin and PP2A in fibroblasts promoted differentiation and proliferation via AKT activation and increased α -SMA expression. In summary, our study demonstrated that low α 2 β 1 integrin expression regulated its downstream targets PTEN and AKT via crosstalk with PP2A, a critical cell signaling pathway that permits aberrant differentiation and proliferation of myofibroblasts on FC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Garrett, Joshua P.</author><author>Lowery, Anthony M.</author><author>Adam, Alejandro P.</author><author>Kowalczyk, Andrew P.</author><author>Vincent, Peter A.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Yap, Alpha</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of endothelial barrier function by p120-catenin∙VE-cadherin interaction</title><secondary-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>85-97</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E16-08-0616</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.molbiolcell.org/lookup/doi/10.1091/mbc.E16-08-0616</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nanes, Benjamin A.</author><author>Grimsley-Myers, Cynthia M.</author><author>Cadwell, Chantel M.</author><author>Robinson, Brian S.</author><author>Lowery, Anthony M.</author><author>Vincent, Peter A.</author><author>Mosunjac, Marina</author><author>Früh, Klaus</author><author>Kowalczyk, Andrew P.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hardin, Jeffrey D.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>p120-catenin regulates VE-cadherin endocytosis and degradation induced by the Kaposi sarcoma–associated ubiquitin ligase K5</title><secondary-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>30-40</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E16-06-0459</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.molbiolcell.org/lookup/doi/10.1091/mbc.E16-06-0459</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagner, Alixandra</author><author>Eldawud, Reem</author><author>White, Andrew</author><author>Agarwal, Sushant</author><author>Stueckle, Todd A.</author><author>Sierros, Konstantinos A.</author><author>Rojanasakul, Yon</author><author>Gupta, Rakesh K.</author><author>Dinu, Cerasela Zoica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toxicity evaluations of nanoclays and thermally degraded byproducts through spectroscopical and microscopical approaches</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) -

This study examined this molecule in human epithelial ovarian tissues and investigated the cellular impact of EPLIN-α on ovarian cancer cells (EOC), SKOV3 and COV504. The expression of EPLIN-α in human ovarian tissues and EOC was assessed at both the mRNA and protein levels using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In vitro assays for cellular matrix adhesion and migration (confirmed by an electrical cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) based method), invasion and cell growth were employed in order to assess the biological influence of EPLIN-α expression on EOC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian cancer samples demonstrated that only a small number expressed EPLIN-α protein. Downregulation of EPLIN-α protein in EOC cell lines increased the growth, invasion, adhesion and migration in vitro. This EPLIN-α downregulation may have a prognostic value. From these data, we conclude that down-regulation of EPLIN-α may be associated with poorer patient prognosis, and that this molecule appears to play a tumour suppressor role by inhibition of EOC growth and migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camp, Sara M.</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T.</author><author>Sun, Chaode</author><author>Usatyuk, Peter V.</author><author>Bittman, Robert</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>&quot;Pulmonary Endothelial Cell Barrier Enhancement by Novel FTY720 Analogs: Methoxy-FTY720, Fluoro-FTY720, and β-Glucuronide-FTY720&quot;</title><secondary-title>Chemistry and Physics of Lipids</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemistry and Physics of Lipids</full-title></periodical><pages>85-93</pages><volume>194</volume><keywords><keyword>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</keyword><keyword>Endothelial barrier regulation</keyword><keyword>FTY720</keyword><keyword>G protein-couple receptors</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine 1-phosphate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ireland Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pulmonary Endothelial Cell Barrier Enhancement by Novel FTY720 Analogs Methoxy-FTY720, Fluoro-FTY720, and β-Glucuronide-FTY720.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.004</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Effective therapeutic agents are lacking for the prevention and reversal of vascular leak, a frequent pathophysiologic result of inflammatory processes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. We previously demonstrated the potent barrier-enhancing effects of related compounds sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the pharmaceutical agent FTY720, and its analog (S)-FTY720 phosphonate (Tys) in models of inflammatory lung injury. In this study, we characterize additional novel FTY720 analogs for their potential to reduce vascular leak as well as utilize them as tools to better understand the mechanisms by which this class of agents modulates permeability. Transendothelial resistance (TER) and labeled dextran studies demonstrate that (R)-methoxy-FTY720 ((R)-OMe-FTY), (R)/(S)-fluoro-FTY720 (FTY-F), and β-glucuronide-FTY720 (FTY-G) compounds display in vitro barrier-enhancing properties comparable or superior to FTY720 and S1P. In contrast, the (S)-methoxy-FTY720 ((S)-OMe-FTY) analog disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity in TER studies in association with actin stress fiber formation and robust intracellular calcium release, but independent of myosin light chain or ERK phosphorylation. Additional mechanistic studies with (R)-OMe-FTY, FTY-F, and FTY-G suggest that lung EC barrier enhancement is mediated through lipid raft signaling, Gi-linked receptor coupling to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation events, and S1PR1-dependent receptor ligation. These results provide important mechanistic insights into modulation of pulmonary vascular barrier function by FTY720-related compounds and highlight common signaling events that may assist the development of novel therapeutic tools in the prevention or reversal of the pulmonary vascular leak that characterizes ARDS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beard, Richard S.</author><author>Yang, Xiaoyuan</author><author>Meegan, Jamie E.</author><author>Overstreet, Jonathan W.</author><author>Yang, Clement G.Y.</author><author>Elliott, John A.</author><author>Reynolds, Jason J.</author><author>Cha, Byeong J.</author><author>Pivetti, Christopher D.</author><author>Mitchell, David A.</author><author>Wu, Mack H.</author><author>Deschenes, Robert J.</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC21 mediates endothelial dysfunction in systemic inflammatory response syndrome</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms12823</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC21 mediates endothelial dysfunction in systemic inflammatory response syndrome..pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Inflammation</label><abstract>Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of systemic inflammatory response underlying multiple organ failure. Here we report a novel function of DHHC-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) in mediating endothelial inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of PATs attenuates barrier leakage and leucocyte adhesion induced by endothelial junction hyperpermeability and ICAM-1 expression during inflammation. Among 11 DHHCs detected in vascular endothelium, DHHC21 is required for barrier response. Mice with DHHC21 function deficiency (Zdhhc21 dep/dep) exhibit marked resistance to injury, characterized by reduced plasma leakage, decreased leucocyte adhesion and ameliorated lung pathology, culminating in improved survival. Endothelial cells from Zdhhc21 dep/dep display blunted barrier dysfunction and leucocyte adhesion, whereas leucocytes from these mice did not show altered adhesiveness. Furthermore, inflammation enhances PLCβ1 palmitoylation and signalling activity, effects significantly reduced in Zdhhc21 dep/dep and rescued by DHHC21 overexpression. Likewise, overexpression of wild-type, not mutant, PLCβ1 augments barrier dysfunction. Altogether, these data suggest the involvement of DHHC21-mediated PLCβ1 palmitoylation in endothelial inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kostadinova, Elena</author><author>Chaput, Catherine</author><author>Gutbier, Birgitt</author><author>Lippmann, Juliane</author><author>Sander, Leif E.</author><author>Mitchell, Timothy J.</author><author>Suttorp, Norbert</author><author>Witzenrath, Martin</author><author>Opitz, Bastian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NLRP3 protects alveolar barrier integrity by an inflammasome-independent increase of epithelial cell adherence</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>30943</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep30943</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30943</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Zhiyong</author><author>Wang, Zhiwei</author><author>Dai, Feifeng</author><author>Liu, Huagang</author><author>Ren, Wei</author><author>Chang, Jinxing</author><author>Li, Bowen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dephosphorylation of Y685-VE-Cadherin Involved in Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Barrier Injury Induced by Angiotensin II</title><secondary-title>Mediators of Inflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mediators of Inflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>2016</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2016/8696481</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2016/8696481/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Angiotensin II (AngII) caused pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier injury, which induced acute aortic dissection (AAD) combined with acute lung injury (ALI). However, the exact mechanism is unclear. We investigated the role of dephosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin in the AngII induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier injury. Mice or pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were divided into control group, AngII group, AngII+PP2 (Src kinase inhibitor) group, and PP2 group. PP2 was used to inhibit the phosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin. Pathological changes, infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, and pulmonary microvascular permeability were used to determine the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier function. Flow cytometry was used to determine the apoptosis of PMVECs, and immunofluorescence was used to determine the skeletal arrangement. Transendothelial resistance was used to detect the permeability of endothelial barrier. Phosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin was significantly reduced after AngII stimulation ( P &lt; 0.05 ), together with skeletal rearrangement, and elevation of endothelial permeability which finally induced endothelial barrier injury. After PP2 interference, the phosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin was further reduced and the endothelial permeability was further elevated. These data indicated that AngII could induce pulmonary injury by triggering endothelial barrier injury, and such process may be related to the dephosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin and the endothelial skeletal rearrangement.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kovacs-Kasa, Anita</author><author>Gorshkov, Boris A.</author><author>Kim, Kyung-Mi</author><author>Kumar, Sanjiv</author><author>Black, Stephen M.</author><author>Fulton, David J.</author><author>Dimitropoulou, Christiana</author><author>Catravas, John D.</author><author>Verin, Alexander D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The protective role of MLCP-mediated ERM dephosphorylation in endotoxin-induced lung injury in vitro and in vivo</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>39018</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep39018</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/srep39018</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poroyko, Valeriy A.</author><author>Carreras, Alba</author><author>Khalyfa, Abdelnaby</author><author>Khalyfa, Ahamed A.</author><author>Leone, Vanessa</author><author>Peris, Eduard</author><author>Almendros, Isaac</author><author>Gileles-Hillel, Alex</author><author>Qiao, Zhuanhong</author><author>Hubert, Nathaniel</author><author>Farré, Ramon</author><author>Chang, Eugene B.</author><author>Gozal, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic Sleep Disruption Alters Gut Microbiota, Induces Systemic and Adipose Tissue Inflammation and Insulin Resistance in Mice</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>35405</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep35405</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/srep35405</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryman, Valerie E.</author><author>Packiriswamy, Nandakumar</author><author>Sordillo, Lorraine M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Apoptosis of Endothelial Cells by 13-HPODE Contributes to Impairment of Endothelial Barrier Integrity</title><secondary-title>Mediators of Inflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mediators of Inflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>2016</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2016/9867138</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2016/9867138/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Inflammation is an essential host response during bacterial infections such as bovine mastitis. Endothelial cells are critical for an appropriate inflammatory response and loss of vascular barrier integrity is implicated in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus uberis -induced mastitis. Previous studies suggested that accumulation of linoleic acid (LA) oxygenation products derived from 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) metabolism could regulate vascular functions. The initial LA derivative from the 15-LOX-1 pathway, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), can induce endothelial death, whereas the reduced hydroxyl product, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), is abundantly produced during vascular activation. However, the relative contribution of specific LA-derived metabolites on impairment of mammary endothelial integrity is unknown. Our hypothesis was that S. uberis -induced LA-derived 15-LOX-1 oxygenation products impair mammary endothelial barrier integrity by apoptosis. Exposure of bovine mammary endothelial cells (BMEC) to S. uberis did not increase 15-LOX-1 LA metabolism. However, S. uberis challenge of bovine monocytes demonstrated that monocytes may be a significant source of both 13-HPODE and 13-HODE during mastitis. Exposure of BMEC to 13-HPODE, but not 13-HODE, significantly reduced endothelial barrier integrity and increased apoptosis. Changing oxidant status by coexposure to an antioxidant during 13-HPODE treatment prevented adverse effects of 13-HPODE, including amelioration of apoptosis. A better understanding of how the oxidant status of the vascular microenvironment impacts endothelial barrier properties could lead to more efficacious treatments for S. uberis mastitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klei, Linda R.</author><author>Hu, Dong</author><author>Panek, Robert</author><author>Alfano, Danielle N.</author><author>Bridwell, Rachel E.</author><author>Bailey, Kelly M.</author><author>Oravecz-Wilson, Katherine I.</author><author>Concel, Vincent J.</author><author>Hess, Emily M.</author><author>Van Beek, Matthew</author><author>Delekta, Phillip C.</author><author>Gu, Shufang</author><author>Watkins, Simon C.</author><author>Ting, Adrian T.</author><author>Gough, Peter J.</author><author>Foley, Kevin P.</author><author>Bertin, John</author><author>McAllister-Lucas, Linda M.</author><author>Lucas, Peter C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MALT1 Protease Activation Triggers Acute Disruption of Endothelial Barrier Integrity via CYLD Cleavage</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>221-232</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.080</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124716311767</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faura Tellez, Grissel</author><author>Willemse, Brigitte W.

The pathogenesis of the infection results from the sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IRBC) in vital organs, including the brain, with resulting impairment of blood flow, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis. Sequestration occurs through the adhesion of IRBC to host receptors on microvascular endothelium by Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a large family of variant surface antigens, each with up to seven extracellular domains that can bind to multiple host receptors. Consequently, antiadhesive therapies directed at single endothelial adhesion molecules may not be effective. In this study, we demonstrated that the serine protease thrombin, which is pivotal in the activation of the coagulation cascade, cleaved the major parasite adhesin on the surface of IRBC. As a result, adhesion under flow was dramatically reduced, and already adherent IRBC were detached. Thrombin cleavage sites were mapped to the Duffy binding-like δ1 (DBLδ1) domain and interdomains 1 and 2 in the PfEMP1 of the parasite line IT4var19. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between the presence of thrombin and IRBC in cerebral malaria autopsies of children. We investigated a modified (R67A) thrombin and thrombin inhibitor, hirugen, both of which inhibit the binding of substrates to exosite I, thereby reducing its proinflammatory properties. Both approaches reduced the barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin without affecting its proteolytic activity on PfEMP1, raising the possibility that thrombin cleavage of variant PfEMP1 may be exploited as a broadly inhibitory antiadhesive therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rom, Slava</author><author>Zuluaga-Ramirez, Viviana</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L.</author><author>Dykstra, Holly</author><author>Gajghate, Sachin</author><author>Pacher, Pal</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PARP inhibition in leukocytes diminishes inflammation via effects on integrins/cytoskeleton and protects the blood-brain barrier</title><secondary-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>254</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12974-016-0729-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-016-0729-x</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owen, Sioned</author><author>Zhao, Huishan</author><author>Dart, Alwyn</author><author>Wang, Yamei</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Gao, Yong</author><author>Wei, Cong</author><author>Wu, Yiling</author><author>Jiang, Wen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat shock protein 27 is a potential indicator for response to YangZheng XiaoJi and chemotherapy agents in cancer cells</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Oncology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijo.2016.3685</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2016.3685</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Haibo</author><author>Han, Xiaokun</author><author>Bretz, Colin A</author><author>Becker, Silke</author><author>Gambhir, Deeksha</author><author>Smith, George W</author><author>Samulski, R Jude</author><author>Wittchen, Erika S</author><author>Quilliam, Lawrence A</author><author>Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, Magdalena</author><author>Hartnett, M Elizabeth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retinal pigment epithelial cell expression of active Rap 1a by scAAV2 inhibits choroidal neovascularization</title><secondary-title>Molecular Therapy - Methods &amp;

However, the molecular processes regulating epithelial barrier maturation are not fully elucidated. After contact, epithelial cells undergo size-reductive proliferation and differentiate, creating a dense, highly ordered monolayer with high resistance barriers. We provide evidence that the tight junction protein occludin contributes to the regulation of epithelial cell maturation upon phosphorylation of S471 in its coiled-coil domain. Overexpression of a phosphoinhibitory occludin S471A mutant prevents size-reductive proliferation and subsequent tight junction maturation in a dominant manner. Inhibition of cell proliferation in cell-contacted but immature monolayers recapitulated this phenotype. A kinase screen identified G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) targeting S471, and GRK inhibitors delayed epithelial packing and junction maturation. We conclude that occludin contributes to the regulation of size-reductive proliferation and epithelial cell maturation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.</abstract></record><record><database

Keratinocytes under NP treatment have shown accelerated cell movement and decreased E-cadherin expression. However, the molecular mechanism of E-cadherin regulation under NP remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we investigated the E-cadherin regulation in keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) under NP. HaCaT cells were treated at ambient pressure (AP) and NP for 12h. Cell movement was measured by traditional and electric wound healing assays at the 2 different pressures. Mutants with overexpression of p120-catenin (p120ctn) were used to observe the effect of NP on p120ctn and E-cadherin expression during wound healing. Cell fractionation and immunoblotting data showed that NP increased Y228-phosphorylated p120ctn level and resulted in the translocation of p120ctn from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence images revealed that NP decreased the co-localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin on the plasma membrane. Knockdown of p120ctn reduced E-cadherin expression and accelerated cell movement under AP. Overexpression of the Y228-phosphorylation-mimic p120ctn decreased E-cadherin membrane expression under both AP and NP. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants conferred restored adherens junctions (AJs) under NP. The Src inhibitor blocked the phosphorylation of p120ctn and impeded cell migration under NP. In conclusion, Src-dependent phosphorylation of p120ctn can respond rapidly to NP and contribute to E-cadherin downregulation. The NP-induced disassembly of the AJ further accelerates wound healing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pennington, Matthew R.</author><author>Curtis, Theresa M.</author><author>Divers, Thomas J.</author><author>Wagner, Bettina</author><author>Ness, SallyAnne L.</author><author>Tennant, Bud C.</author><author>Van de Walle, Gerlinde R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Equine Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Different Sources Efficiently Differentiate into Hepatocyte-Like Cells</title><secondary-title>Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>596-607</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0403</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0403</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haasdijk, Remco A.</author><author>Den Dekker, Wijnand K.</author><author>Cheng, Caroline</author><author>Tempel, Dennie</author><author>Szulcek, Robert</author><author>Bos, Frank L.</author><author>Hermkens, Dorien M.A.</author><author>Chrifi, Ihsan</author><author>Brandt, Maarten M.</author><author>Van Dijk, Chris</author><author>Xu, Yan Juan</author><author>Van De Kamp, Esther H.M.</author><author>Blonden, Lau A.J.</author><author>Van Bezu, Jan</author><author>Sluimer, Judith C.</author><author>Biessen, Erik A.L.</author><author>Van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten P.</author><author>Duckers, Henricus J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THSD1 preserves vascular integrity and protects against intraplaque haemorrhaging in ApoE −/− mice</title><secondary-title>Cardiovascular Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cardiovascular Research</full-title></periodical><pages>129-139</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cvr/cvw015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvw015</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maeda, T.</author><author>Inagaki, M.</author><author>Fujita, Y.</author><author>Kimoto, T.</author><author>Tanabe-Fujimura, C.</author><author>Zou, K.</author><author>Liu, J.</author><author>Liu, S.</author><author>Komano, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ATP increases the migration of microglia across the brain endothelial cell monolayer</title><secondary-title>Bioscience Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioscience Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>e00318-e00318</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1042/BSR20160054</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://bioscirep.org/cgi/doi/10.1042/BSR20160054</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function;ECIS Modeling</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcos-Ramiro, Beatriz</author><author>García-Weber, Diego</author><author>Barroso, Susana</author><author>Feito, Jorge</author><author>Ortega, María C.</author><author>Cernuda-Morollón, Eva</author><author>Reglero-Real, Natalia</author><author>Fernández-Martín, Laura</author><author>Durán, Maria C.</author><author>Alonso, Miguel A.</author><author>Correas, Isabel</author><author>Cox, Susan</author><author>Ridley, Anne J.</author><author>Millán, Jaime</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RhoB controls endothelial barrier recovery by inhibiting Rac1 trafficking to the cell border</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>385-402</pages><volume>213</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.201504038</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jcb.org/lookup/doi/10.1083/jcb.201504038</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Endothelial barrier dysfunction underlies chronic inflammatory diseases. In searching for new proteins essential to the human endothelial inflammatory response, we have found that the endosomal GTPase RhoB is up-regulated in response to inflammatory cytokines and expressed in the endothelium of some chronically inflamed tissues. We show that although RhoB and the related RhoA and RhoC play additive and redundant roles in various aspects of endothelial barrier function, RhoB specifically inhibits barrier restoration after acute cell contraction by preventing plasma membrane extension. During barrier restoration, RhoB trafficking is induced between vesicles containing RhoB nanoclusters and plasma membrane protrusions. The Rho GTPase Rac1 controls membrane spreading and stabilizes endothelial barriers. We show that RhoB colocalizes with Rac1 in endosomes and inhibits Rac1 activity and trafficking to the cell border during barrier recovery. Inhibition of endosomal trafficking impairs barrier reformation, whereas induction of Rac1 translocation to the plasma membrane accelerates it. Therefore, RhoB-specific regulation of Rac1 trafficking controls endothelial barrier integrity during inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grade, Patient-derived High</author><author>Ovarian, Serous</author><author>Negative, Triple</author><author>Cancer, Breast</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>International Journal of Chronic Diseases &amp; Therapy ( IJCDT ) Patient-Derived High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells</title></titles><periodical/><pages>31-38</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>brca1</keyword><keyword>brca1a</keyword><keyword>interaction</keyword><keyword>migration</keyword><keyword>proliferation</keyword><keyword>protein-protein</keyword><keyword>serous epithelial ovarian cancers</keyword><keyword>triple negative breast cancers</keyword><keyword>ubc9</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Grade et al. - 2016 - International Journal of Chronic Diseases &amp; Therapy ( IJCDT ) Patient-Derived High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer and.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Lu</author><author>Chen, Xufeng</author><author>Simet, Samantha M</author><author>Hu, Guoku</author><author>Cai, Yu</author><author>Niu, Fang</author><author>Kook, Yeonhee</author><author>Buch, Shilpa J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ROS/HIF-1α/PDGF-BB Autocrine Loop Contributes to Cocaine-mediated Alveolar Epithelial Barrier Damage</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>rcmb.2016-0096OC</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2016-0096OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1165/rcmb.2016-0096OC</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jensen, Maria Risager</author><author>Bajic, Goran</author><author>Zhang, Xianwei</author><author>Laustsen, Anne Kjær</author><author>Koldsø, Heidi</author><author>Skeby, Katrine Kirkeby</author><author>Schiøtt, Birgit</author><author>Andersen, Gregers R.</author><author>Vorup-Jensen, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structural Basis for Simvastatin Competitive Antagonism of Complement Receptor 3</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>16963-16976</pages><volume>291</volume><issue>33</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M116.732222</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.M116.732222</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Canning, Paul</author><author>Kenny, Bridget-Ann</author><author>Prise, Vivien</author><author>Glenn, Josephine</author><author>Sarker, Mosharraf H</author><author>Hudson, Natalie</author><author>Brandt, Martin</author><author>Lopez, Francisco J</author><author>Gale, David</author><author>Luthert, Philip J</author><author>Adamson, Peter</author><author>Turowski, Patric</author><author>Stitt, Alan W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) as a therapeutic target to prevent retinal vasopermeability during diabetes.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>7213-8</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27298369</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1514213113</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Canning et al. - 2016 - Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) as a therapeutic target to prevent retinal vasopermeability du.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/long/113/26/7213</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) hydrolyses oxidized low-density lipoproteins into proinflammatory products, which can have detrimental effects on vascular function. As a specific inhibitor of Lp-PLA2, darapladib has been shown to be protective against atherogenesis and vascular leakage in diabetic and hypercholesterolemic animal models. This study has investigated whether Lp-PLA2 and its major enzymatic product, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), are involved in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) damage during diabetic retinopathy. We assessed BRB protection in diabetic rats through use of species-specific analogs of darapladib. Systemic Lp-PLA2 inhibition using SB-435495 at 10 mg/kg (i.p.) effectively suppressed BRB breakdown in streptozotocin-diabetic Brown Norway rats. This inhibitory effect was comparable to intravitreal VEGF neutralization, and the protection against BRB dysfunction was additive when both targets were inhibited simultaneously. Mechanistic studies in primary brain and retinal microvascular endothelial cells, as well as occluded rat pial microvessels, showed that luminal but not abluminal LPC potently induced permeability, and that this required signaling by the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Taken together, this study demonstrates that Lp-PLA2 inhibition can effectively prevent diabetes-mediated BRB dysfunction and that LPC impacts on the retinal vascular endothelium to induce vasopermeability via VEGFR2. Thus, Lp-PLA2 may be a useful therapeutic target for patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), perhaps in combination with currently administered anti-VEGF agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broekman, W.</author><author>Roelofs, H.</author><author>Zarcone, M.

To investigate this, BM-MSCs from nine COPD patients and nine non-COPD age-matched controls were compared with regard to immunophenotype, growth and differentiation potential, and migration capacity. Other functional assays included the response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and inducers of the nuclear factor (erythroid derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway, and effects on NCI-H292 airway epithelial cells.

No significant differences were observed in terms of morphology, proliferation and migration, except for increased adipocyte differentiation potential in the COPD group. Both groups were comparable regarding mRNA expression of growth factors and inflammatory mediators, and in their potential to induce mRNA expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in NCI-H292 airway epithelial cells. MSCs from COPD patients secreted more interleukin-6 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway resulted in a comparable induction of mRNA expression of four target genes, but the expression of the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 was lower in MSCs from COPD patients.

The observation that MSCs from COPD patients are phenotypically and functionally comparable to those from non-COPD controls implies that autologous MSCs can be considered for use in the setting of clinical trials as a treatment for COPD.

Phenotype and functional analysis of BM-MSCs from COPD patients supports their use in autologous MSC treatment &lt;http://ow.ly/TRtX3008t6c&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Hung-Yen</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal A</author><author>Goldberg, Eugene P</author><author>Kaye, Frederic</author><author>Najmunnisa, Nasreen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Silencing Receptor EphA2 Enhanced Sensitivity to Lipoplatin™ in Lung Tumor and MPM Cells.</title><secondary-title>Cancer investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer investigation</full-title></periodical><pages>293-304</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>EphA2 receptor</keyword><keyword>Lipoplatin</keyword><keyword>combination therapy</keyword><keyword>liposomal nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>malignant pleural mesothelioma</keyword><keyword>non-small cell lung cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><accession-num>27438907</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07357907.2016.1201678</electronic-resource-num><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07357907.2016.1201678#.V-rZdmwYzMw.mendeley</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Receptor EphA2 is overexpressed in lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) which promote tumorogenesis.

Certain pathological conditions necessitate its removal and replacement. Current substitutes, like silicone oils and perfluorocarbons, are not biomimetic and have known complications. In this study, we have developed an in situ forming two-component biomimetic hydrogel with tunable mechanical and osmotic properties. The components are gellan, an analogue of collagen, and poly(methacrylamide-co-methacrylate), an analogue of hyaluronic acid; both endowed with thiol side groups. We used response surface methodology to consider seventeen possible hydrogels to determine how each component affects the optical, mechanical, sol-gel transition temperature and swelling properties. The optical and physical properties of the hydrogels were similar to vitreous. The shear storage moduli ranged from 3 to 358Pa at 1Hz and sol-gel transition temperatures from 35.5 to 43°C. The hydrogel had the ability to remain swollen without degradation for four weeks in vitro. Three hydrogels were tested for biocompatibility on primary porcine retinal pigment epithelial cells, human retinal pigment epithelial cells, and fibroblast (3T3/NIH) cells, by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system. The two-component hydrogels allowed for the tuning and optimizing of mechanical, swelling, and transition temperature to obtain three biocompatible hydrogels with properties similar to the vitreous. Future studies include testing of the optimized hydrogels in animal models for use as a long-term substitute, whose preliminary results are mentioned. 

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
Although hydrogels are researched as long-term vitreous substitute, none have advanced sufficiently to reach clinical application. Our work focuses on the development of a novel two component in situ forming hydrogel that bio-mimic the natural vitreous. Our thiol-containing copolymers can be injected as an aqueous solution into the vitreous cavity wherein, at physiological temperature, the rigid component will instantaneously form a physical gel imbedding the random coil copolymer. Upon subsequent oxidation, the two components will form disulfide cross-links and a stable reversible hydrogel capable of providing osmotic pressure to reattach the retina. It may be left in the eye permanently or easily removed by injection of a simple reducing agent to cleave the disulfide bonds, rather than surgery. This contribution is significant because it is expected to provide patients with a much better quality of life by improving surgical outcomes, creating much less post-operative burden, and reducing the need for secondary surgeries.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adam, Alejandro P</author><author>Lowery, Anthony M</author><author>Martino, Nina</author><author>Alsaffar, Hiba</author><author>Vincent, Peter A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Src Family Kinases Modulate the Loss of Endothelial Barrier Function in Response to TNF-α: Crosstalk with p38 Signaling.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0161975</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><accession-num>27603666</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0161975</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Adam et al. - 2016 - Src Family Kinases Modulate the Loss of Endothelial Barrier Function in Response to TNF-α Crosstalk with p38 Signal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161975</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK) signaling is required for the increase in endothelial permeability induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. However, we previously demonstrated that activation of endogenous SFKs by expression of dominant negative C-terminal Src Kinase (DN-Csk) is not sufficient to decrease endothelial adherens junction integrity. Basal SFK activity has been observed in normal venular endothelia and was not associated with increased basal permeability. The basal SFK activity however was found to contribute to increased sensitivity of the venular endothelium to inflammatory mediator-induced leakage. How SFK activation achieves this is still not well understood. Here, we show that SFK activation renders human dermal microvascular endothelial cells susceptible to low doses of TNF-α. Treatment of DN-Csk-expressing cells with 50 pg/ml TNF-α induced a loss of TEER as well as drastic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion proteins. This synergistic effect was independent of ROCK or NF-κB activity. TNF-α-induced p38 signaling was required for the synergistic effect on barrier function, and activation of the p38 MAPK alone was also able to induce changes in permeability only in monolayers with active SFKs. These results suggest that the activation of endogenous levels of SFK renders the endothelial barrier more susceptible to low, physiologic doses of TNF-α through activation of p38 which leads to a loss of endothelial tight junctions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Letsiou, E.</author><author>Sammani, S.</author><author>Wang, H.</author><author>Belvitch, P.</author><author>Dudek, S.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parkin regulates LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses in acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>Translational Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Translational Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.trsl.2016.09.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition resulting from direct or indirect lung injury that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. A key biological event in the pathogenesis of the acute lung injury (ALI) that causes ARDS is activation of the lung endothelium (EC), which is triggered by a variety of inflammatory insults leading to barrier disruption and excessive adhesion/activation of neutrophils. Recently, we demonstrated that imatinib protects against LPS-induced EC activation by inhibiting c-Abl kinase. In the present study, we explored the role of parkin, a novel c-Abl substrate, in ALI. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase originally characterized in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease; however its potential role in acute inflammatory processes and lung EC function remain largely unknown. Using parkin deficient (PARK2-/-) mice, we now demonstrate a crucial role for parkin in mediating LPS-induced ALI. After LPS, PARK2-/- mice have reduced total protein and cell levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) compared to wild type (WT). Moreover, in LPS-treated PARK2-/- lungs, the sequestration/activation of neutrophils and release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-ɑ) are significantly reduced. The BAL levels of soluble VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are also decreased in LPS-treated PARK2-/- mice compared to WT. In cultured human lung endothelial cells, down-regulation of parkin by siRNA decreases LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression, IL-8 and IL-6 secretion, and NF-kB phosphorylation. These results suggest a previously unidentified role of parkin in mediating endotoxin-induced endothelial pro-inflammatory signaling, and indicate that it may play a critical role in acute inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gallego-Delgado, Julio</author><author>Basu-Roy, Upal</author><author>Ty, Maureen</author><author>Alique, Matilde</author><author>Fernandez-Arias, Cristina</author><author>Movila, Alexandru</author><author>Gomes, Pollyanna</author><author>Weinstock, Ada</author><author>Xu, Wenyue</author><author>Edagha, Innocent</author><author>Wassmer, Samuel C</author><author>Walther, Thomas</author><author>Ruiz-Ortega, Marta</author><author>Rodriguez, Ana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiotensin receptors and β-catenin regulate brain endothelial integrity in malaria.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of clinical investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of clinical investigation</full-title></periodical><volume>126</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>American Society for Clinical Investigation</publisher><accession-num>27643439</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/JCI87306</electronic-resource-num><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jci.org/articles/view/87306#.V-rXQESrWK4.mendeley</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cerebral malaria is characterized by cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs) to endothelial cells in the brain, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and cerebral microhemorrhages. No available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs induce activation of β-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Inhibition of β-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that β-catenin is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity. Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2 receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of β-catenin and prevented the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria, modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral malaria. The interrelation of the β-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling pathways opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Theiler, Anna</author><author>Konya, Viktoria</author><author>Pasterk, Lisa</author><author>Maric, Jovana</author><author>Bärnthaler, Thomas</author><author>Lanz, Ilse</author><author>Platzer, Wolfgang</author><author>Schuligoi, Rufina</author><author>Heinemann, Akos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The EP1/EP3 receptor agonist 17-pt-PGE2 acts as an EP4 receptor agonist on endothelial barrier function and in a model of LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation</title><secondary-title>Vascular Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vascular Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vph.2016.09.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of inflammatory conditions. We recently demonstrated that prostaglandin (PG)E2 enhances the resistance of pulmonary endothelium in vitro and counteracts lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation in vivo via EP4 receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the EP1/EP3 receptor agonist 17-phenyl-trinor-(pt)-PGE2 on acute lung inflammation in a mouse model. In LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice, 17-pt-PGE2 reduced neutrophil infiltration and inhibited vascular leakage. These effects were unaltered by an EP1 antagonist, but reversed by EP4 receptor antagonists. 17-pt-PGE2 increased the resistance of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and prevented thrombin-induced disruption of endothelial junctions. Again, these effects were not mediated via EP1 or EP3 but through activation of the EP4 receptor, as demonstrated by the lack of effect of more selective EP1 and EP3 receptor agonists, prevention of these effects by EP4 antagonists and EP4 receptor knock-down by siRNA. In contrast, the aggregation enhancing effect of 17-pt-PGE2 in human platelets was mediated via EP3 receptors. Our results demonstrate that 17-pt-PGE2 enhances the endothelial barrier in vitro on pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, and accordingly ameliorates the recruitment of neutrophils, via EP4 receptors in vivo. This suggests a beneficial effect of 17-pt-PGE2 on pulmonary inflammatory diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Xinyong</author><author>Ohmura, Tomomi</author><author>Shah, Alok S.</author><author>Son, Sophia</author><author>Tian, Yufeng</author><author>Birukova, Anna A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of End Binding Protein-1 in endothelial permeability response to barrier-disruptive and barrier-enhancing agonists</title><secondary-title>Cellular Signalling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular Signalling</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.09.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0898656816302315</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Rapid changes in microtubule (MT) polymerization dynamics affect regional activity of small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which play a key role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and endothelial cell (EC) permeability. This study tested the role of End Binding Protein-1 (EB1) in the mechanisms of increased and decreased EC permeability caused by thrombin and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and mediated by RhoA and Rac1 GTPases, respectively. Stimulation of human lung EC with thrombin inhibited peripheral MT growth, which was monitored by morphological and biochemical evaluation of peripheral MT and the levels of stabilized MT. In contrast, stimulation of EC with HGF promoted peripheral MT growth and protrusion of EB1-positive MT plus ends to the EC peripheral submembrane area. EB1 knockdown by small interfering RNA did not affect partial MT depolymerization, activation of Rho signaling, and permeability response to thrombin, but suppressed the HGF-induced endothelial barrier enhancement. EB1 knockdown suppressed HGF-induced activation of Rac1 and Rac1 cytoskeletal effectors cortactin and PAK1, impaired HGF-induced assembly of cortical cytoskeleton regulatory complex (WAVE-p21Arc-IQGAP1), and blocked HGF-induced enhancement of peripheral actin cytoskeleton and VE-cadherin-positive adherens junctions. Altogether, these data demonstrate a role for EB1 in coordination of MT-dependent barrier enhancement response to HGF, but show no involvement of EB1 in acute increase of EC permeability caused by the barrier disruptive agonist. The results suggest that increased peripheral EB1 distribution is a critical component of the Rac1-mediated pathway and peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling essential for agonist-induced EC barrier enhancement.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chatterjee, Ishita</author><author>Baruah, Jugajyoti</author><author>Lurie, Erin E.</author><author>Wary, Kishore K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 deficiency that disrupts the endothelial barrier function is a modifier of cardiovascular development</title><secondary-title>Cardiovascular Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cardiovascular Research</full-title></periodical><pages>105-118</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cvr/cvw090</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvw090</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monickaraj, F.</author><author>McGuire, P.

A potential molecule of interest in this regard in TRPM2 (transient receptor potential (melastatin) 2), an oxidant sensitive, non-selective cation channel expressed in the lung endothelium that is known to regulate endothelial cell (EC) permeability and cellular responses to radiation injury. Thus, we hypothesized that TRPM2 is an important regulator of RILI-mediated by sphingolipids.Methods To assess the role of TRPM2 on endothelial cell barrier regulation, human pulmonary artery EC were grown to confluence overlying gold-plated microelectrodes for real-time measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) reflective of barrier integrity via an Electrical Cell-sensing Impedance System (ECIS, Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY). Cells were transfected with TRPM2 siRNA (100 mM, 3 d) or non-specific siRNA prior to treatment with sphingosine 1-phosphate (1 mM), known to induce barrier enhancement. In separate experiments, prior to S1P stimulation EC were treated with either DPQ or 3-AB, both inhibitors of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that mediates TRPM2 channel opening. Subsequently, to assess the role of TRPM2 to RILI in a previously characterized in vivo model, female TRPM2-/- mice were subjected to 20 Gy single dose thoracic radiation with body weights measured every 2 weeks and bronchalveolar lavage fluid collected for measurement of protein levels at 6 wks.Results TRPM2-silenced EC demonstrated a significant attenuation of S1P-induced barrier enhancement as measured by TER. In addition, barrier enhancement by S1P was also significantly attenuated in cells treated with either DPQ or 3-AB. In our murine RILI model, body weights increased at 2 weeks in wildtype radiated mice while weights were decreased in TRPM2−/− mice consistent with an increased injury response in these animals. Similarly, at 6 weeks TRPM2−/− mice were found to have a significant increase in BAL protein levels compared to TRPM2−/− control animals (1.54 fold change, p&amp;lt;0.022) while there was not a significant increase noted in RILI-challenged wildtype mice.Conclusion Our data confirm TRPM2 as an important mediator of EC barrier regulation of S1P. Moreover, we found TRPM2−/− mice were more susceptible to RILI, a model of inflammatory lung injury mediated by sphingolipid signaling. Our findings suggest that modulation of TRPM2 effecting downstream sphingolipid signaling may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for some patients with inflammatory lung diseases including RILI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang,

typically used for cytotoxicity screenings. Here, we developed a label-free Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)-based cytotoxicity assay that can be applied in the assessment of the cytotoxicity of natural extracts. The conditions to measure the impedance using ECIS were first optimized in mice immortalized hypothalamic neurons GT1-7 cells. The performance of four natural extracts when tested using three conventional cytotoxicity assays in GT1-7 cells, was studied. Betula pendula (silver birch tree) was found to interfere with all of the cytotoxicity assays in which labels were applied. The silver birch extract was also proven to be cytotoxic and, thus, served as a proof-of-concept for the use of ECIS. The extract was fractionated and the ECIS method permitted the distinction of specific kinetic patterns of cytotoxicity on the fractions as well as the extract’s pure constituents. This study offers evidence that ECIS is an excellent tool for real-time monitoring of the cytotoxicity of complex extracts that are difficult to work with using conventional (label-based) assays. Altogether, it offers a very suitable cytotoxicity-screening assay making the work with natural products less challenging within the drug discovery workflow.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daniel, Anna E.</author><author>Timmerman, Ilse</author><author>Kovacevic, Igor</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L.</author><author>Adriaanse, Luc</author><author>Paatero, Ilkka</author><author>Belting, Heinz Georg</author><author>Van Buul, Jaap D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 controls vascular integrity by regulating VE-cadherin trafficking</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26714278</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0145684</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145684</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER</label><abstract>Background: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor, is expressed and secreted by endothelial cells. Patients with PAI-1 deficiency show a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis, which has been exclusively ascribed to the function of PAI-1 in down-regulating fibrinolysis. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 function plays a direct role in controlling vascular integrity and permeability by keeping endothelial cell-cell junctions intact. Methodology/Principal Findings: We utilized PAI-039, a specific small molecule inhibitor of PAI-1, to investigate the role of PAI-1 in protecting endothelial integrity. In vivo inhibition of PAI-1 resulted in vascular leakage from intersegmental vessels and in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. In addition PAI- 1 inhibition in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers leads to a marked decrease of transendothelial resistance and disrupted endothelial junctions. The total level of the endothelial junction regulator VE-cadherin was reduced, whereas surface VE-cadherin expression was unaltered. Moreover, PAI-1 inhibition reduced the shedding of VEcadherin. Finally, we detected an accumulation of VE-cadherin at the Golgi apparatus. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that PAI-1 function is important for the maintenance of endothelial monolayer and vascular integrity by controlling VE-cadherin trafficking to and from the plasma membrane. Our data further suggest that therapies using PAI-1 antagonists like PAI-039 ought to be used with caution to avoid disruption of the vessel wall.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Carroll, Simon J.</author><author>Kho, Dan Ting</author><author>Wiltshire, Rachael</author><author>Nelson, Vicky</author><author>Rotimi, Odunayo</author><author>Johnson, Rebecca</author><author>Angel, Catherine E.</author><author>Graham, E.

The endothelial cells are the critical interface between the blood and the CNS parenchyma and are a critical component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These cells are innately programmed to respond to a myriad of inflammatory cytokines or other danger signals. IL-1β and TNFaα are well recognised pro-inflammatory mediators, and here, we provide compelling evidence that they regulate the function and immune response profile of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMVECs) differentially. Methods: We used xCELLigence biosensor technology, which revealed global differences in the endothelial response between IL-1β and TNFaα. xCELLigence is a label-free impedance-based biosensor, which is ideal for acute or long-term comparison of drug effects on cell behaviour. In addition, flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays were used to show differences in the inflammatory responses from the endothelial cells. Results: Extensive cytokine-secretion profiling and cell-surface immune phenotyping confirmed that the immune response of the hCMVEC to IL-1β was different to that of TNFaα. Interestingly, of the 38 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors measured by cytometric bead array, the endothelial cells secreted only 13. Of importance was the observation that the majority of these cytokines were differentially regulated by either IL-1β or TNFaα. Cell-surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were also differentially regulated by IL-1β or TNFaα, where TNFaα induced a substantially higher level of expression of both key leukocyte-adhesion molecules. A range of other cell-surface cellular and junctional adhesion molecules were basally expressed by the hCMVEC but were unaffected by IL-1β or TNFaα. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive analysis of the immunological profile of brain endothelial cells and the first direct evidence that human brain endothelial cells are differentially regulated by these two key pro-inflammatory mediators.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caron, Tyler J.</author><author>Scott, Kathleen E.</author><author>Fox, James G.</author><author>Hagen, Susan J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tight junction disruption: Helicobacter pylori and dysregulation of the gastric mucosal barrier</title><secondary-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>11411-11427</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>40</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3748/wjg.v21.i40.11411</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Long-term chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) is a risk factor for gastric cancer development. In the multi-step process that leads to gastric cancer, tight junction dysfunction is thought to occur and serve as a risk factor by permitting the permeation of luminal contents across an otherwise tight mucosa. Mechanisms that regulate tight junction function and structure in the normal stomach, or dysfunction in the infected stomach, however, are largely unknown. Although conventional tight junction components are expressed in gastric epithelial cells, claudins regulate paracellular permeability and are likely the target of inflammation or H. pylori itself. There are 27 different claudin molecules, each with unique properties that render the mucosa an intact barrier that is permselective in a way that is consistent with cell physiology. Understanding the architecture of tight junctions in the normal stomach and then changes that occur during infection is important but challenging, because most of the reports that catalog claudin expression in gastric cancer pathogenesis are contradictory. Furthermore, the role of H. pylori virulence factors, such as cytotoxin-associated gene A and vacoulating cytotoxin, in regulating tight junction dysfunction during infection is inconsistent in different gastric cell lines and in vivo , likely because non-gastric epithelial cell cultures were initially used to unravel the details of their effects on the stomach. Hampering further study, as well, is the relative lack of cultured cell models that have tight junction claudins that are consistent with native tissues. This summary will review the current state of knowledge about gastric tight junctions, normally and in H. pylori infection, and make predictions about the consequences of claudin reorganization during H. pylori infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reiss, Bjoern</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of different cell monolayers grown on gold-film electrodes</title><secondary-title>2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)</full-title></periodical><pages>7079-7082</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-9271-8</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320023</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7320023</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Caiqing</author><author>Liu, Qingfa</author><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Li, Liqun</author><author>Du, Juan</author><author>Xie, Qi</author><author>Hu, Hesheng</author><author>Yan, Suhua</author><author>Zhou, Xia</author><author>Li, Changsheng</author><author>Lobe, Corrinne</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Catalpol downregulates vascular endothelial‑cadherin expression and induces vascular hyperpermeability</title><secondary-title>Molecular Medicine Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Medicine Reports</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/mmr.2015.4522</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2015.4522</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Fuhong</author><author>Wang, Bei</author><author>Li, Liqun</author><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Chen, Xiaocui</author><author>Li, Yan</author><author>Dong, Xiuzhen</author><author>Wada, Youichiro</author><author>Kapron, Carolyn</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low-Dose Cadmium Upregulates VEGF Expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</full-title></periodical><pages>10508-10521</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijerph120910508</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/9/10508/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author><author>Hill, Jeremy</author><author>Zhang, Ming</author><author>Dykstra, Holly</author><author>Winfield, Malika</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L</author><author>Potula, Raghava</author><author>Mukherjee, Abir</author><author>Ramirez, Servio H</author><author>Rom, Slava</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dysfunction of brain pericytes in chronic neuroinflammation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp;

The aim of this study was to develop a Raman-based methodology to study the nuclear accumulation of anthracyclines in the endothelium. For this purpose bimodal confocal Raman and fluorescence imaging was used to monitor cellular composition changes as a result of anthracycline exposure on endothelial cells (EA.hy926), and nuclear drug accumulation, respectively. Simultaneously effects of anthracyclines on endothelium viability were investigated by caspases-3 and -7 and MTT assays. We demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of DOX and EDOX was similar; however, EDNR accumulated in endothelial nuclei at concentrations 10 times higher than DNR. In turn, epimers of DOX or DNR were both consistently less toxic on the endothelium as compared to their congeners as evidenced by MTT and caspase assays. In summary, bimodal Raman and fluorescence-based nucleus profiling proves to be a valuable tool to study structure-activity relationship of nuclear accumulation and toxicity of anthracyclines in endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

We modeled this process by TNF treatment of cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HDMEC) monolayers, which unlike human umbilical vein endothelial cells form claudin-5-dependent tight junctions and a high-resistance permeability barrier. Continuous monitoring with electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing revealed that TNF disrupts tight junction-dependent HDMEC barriers in discrete steps: an ~5% increase in transendothelial electrical resistance over 40 minutes; a decrease to ~10% below basal levels over 2 hours (phase 1 leak); an interphase plateau of 1 hour; and a major fall in transendothelial electrical resistance to &lt; 70% of basal levels by 8-10 hours (phase 2 leak), with EC50 values of TNF for phase 1 and 2 leak of ~30 and ~150 pg/ml, respectively. TNF leak is reversible and independent of cell death. Leak correlates with disruption of continuous claudin-5 immunofluorescence staining, myosin light chain phosphorylation and loss of claudin-5 co-localization with cortical actin. All these responses require NF-κB signaling, shown by inhibition with Bay 11 or overexpression of IκB super-repressor, and are blocked by H-1152 or Y-27632, selective inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase that do not block other NF-κB-dependent responses. siRNA combined knockdown of Rho-associated kinase-1 and -2 also prevents myosin light chain phosphorylation, loss of claudin-5/actin co-localization, claudin-5 reorganization and reduces phase 1 leak. However, unlike H-1152 and Y-27632, combined Rho-associated kinase-1/2 siRNA knockdown does not reduce the magnitude of phase 2 leak, suggesting that H-1152 and Y-27632 have targets beyond Rho-associated kinases that regulate endothelial barrier function. We conclude that TNF disrupts TJs in HDMECs in two distinct NF-κB-dependent steps, the first involving Rho-associated kinase and the second likely to involve an as yet unidentified but structurally related protein kinase(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adderley, Shaquria P</author><author>Lawrence, Curtis</author><author>Madonia, Eyong</author><author>Olubadewo, Joseph O</author><author>Breslin, Jerome W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histamine activates p38 MAP kinase and alters local lamellipodia dynamics, reducing endothelial barrier integrity and eliciting central movement of actin fibers</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>C51-C59</pages><volume>309</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajpcell.00096.2015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ajpcell.physiology.org/lookup/doi/10.1152/ajpcell.00096.2015</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cavet, Megan E</author><author>Vollmer, Thomas R</author><author>Harrington, Karen L</author><author>VanDerMeid, Karl</author><author>Richardson, Mary E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of Endothelin-1–Induced Trabecular Meshwork Cell Contractility by Latanoprostene Bunod</title><secondary-title>Investigative Opthalmology &amp; Visual Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative Opthalmology &amp; Visual Science</full-title></periodical><pages>4108</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>-donating</keyword><keyword>atanoprostene bunod</keyword><keyword>contractility</keyword><keyword>for its ability to</keyword><keyword>fp</keyword><keyword>glaucoma</keyword><keyword>in</keyword><keyword>iop</keyword><keyword>is a nitric oxide</keyword><keyword>lbn</keyword><keyword>nitric oxide</keyword><keyword>no</keyword><keyword>prostaglandin</keyword><keyword>prostaglandin f2 a</keyword><keyword>receptor agonist under investigation</keyword><keyword>reduce elevated intraocular pressure</keyword><keyword>trabecular meshwork</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26114488</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.14-16015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26114488</url><url>http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.1167/iovs.14-16015</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function</label><abstract>PURPOSE: Previous in vivo studies demonstrated that latanoprostene bunod (LBN), a nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin F2α receptor agonist, results in greater intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering than latanoprost. The present series of investigations compared the effects of LBN and latanoprost on primary human trabecular meshwork cell (HTMC) contractility and underlying signaling pathways to determine whether LBN might mediate this additional IOP lowering via the conventional outflow pathway.\n\nMETHODS: The effect of LBN (1-100 μM) on HTMC cGMP levels was determined by ELISA with or without the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was used to induce HTMC contractility. To determine the effect of LBN on myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) phosphorylation, HTMCs were pretreated with 10 to 60 μM LBN for 1 hour and then ET-1 for 5 minutes. MLC-2 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. Effects of LBN (30 and 45 μM) on ET-1-induced filamentous (F)-actin cytoskeletal stress fibers and the focal adhesion associated protein vinculin were determined by confocal microscopy. ET-1-induced HTMC monolayer resistance in the presence of LBN (45 μM) was determined by electrical cell substrate impedance sensing, as an indicator of cell contractility. Latanoprost and SE 175 (an NO donor which releases NO on reductive transformation within the cells) were used as comparators in all studies.\n\nRESULTS: LBN (1-100 μM) significantly increased cGMP levels in a dose-dependent manner, with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.5 ± 1.3 μM, and with maximal effect similar to that of 100 μM SE 175. In contrast, latanoprost caused a minimal increase in cGMP levels at 100 μM only. The cGMP elevation induced by LBN or SE 175 was abolished by ODQ and was therefore sGC-dependent. The two NO donors SE 175 and LBN elicited a reduction in ET-1-induced MLC-2 phosphorylation that was significantly greater than that mediated by latanoprost in HTMCs. SE 175 (100 μM) and LBN (30 or 45 μM) caused a dramatic reduction in ET-1-induced actin stress fibers and vinculin localization at focal adhesions, whereas 45 μM latanoprost was without observable effect. SE 175 reduced ET-1-induced increases in HTMC resistance in a dose-dependent manner. A synergistic effect on reduction of HTMC resistance was observed when latanoprost and SE 175 doses were given together. LBN significantly reduced ET-1-induced HTMC monolayer resistance increases to a greater extent than latanoprost, indicating a greater reduction in cell contractility with LBN.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: LBN, SE 175, and latanoprost caused relaxation of ET-1-contracted HTMCs. The effect on HTMC relaxation observed with LBN was significantly greater in magnitude than that observed with latanoprost or SE 175. Data indicate that the NO-donating moiety of LBN mediates HTMC relaxation through activation of the cGMP signaling pathway and a subsequent reduction in MLC-2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that increased conventional outflow facility may mediate the additional IOP-lowering effects of LBN over that of latanoprost observed in in vivo studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, C -I.</author><author>Chen, W -T.</author><author>Lai, Y -T.</author><author>Lo, C -M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrically Assessing the Effect of TGF-β1 on MDA-MB-231 Cells</title></titles><periodical/><pages>188-191</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-12262-5_52</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-12262-5_52</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chichger, H</author><author>Duong, H</author><author>Braza, J</author><author>Harrington, E O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p18, a novel adaptor protein, regulates pulmonary endothelial barrier function via enhanced endocytic recycling of VE-cadherin</title><secondary-title>The FASEB Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>868-881</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.14-257212</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/doi/10.1096/fj.14-257212</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Liqun</author><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Xu, Dongmei</author><author>Du, Linna</author><author>Yan, Suhua</author><author>Hu, Hesheng</author><author>Lobe, Corrinne G</author><author>Yi, Fan</author><author>Kapron, Carolyn M</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term, low-dose cadmium exposure induces hyperpermeability in human renal glomerular endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a-n/a</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jat.3168</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jat.3168</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Hongyan</author><author>Poirier, Christophe</author><author>Cook, Todd</author><author>Traktuev, Dmitry O</author><author>Merfeld-Clauss, Stephanie</author><author>Lease, Benjamin</author><author>Petrache, Irina</author><author>March, Keith L</author><author>Bogatcheva, Natalia V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conditioned media from adipose stromal cells limit lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury, endothelial hyperpermeability and apoptosis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Translational Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Translational Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>67</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12967-015-0422-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/13/1/67</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Vallière, Cheryl</author><author>Vidal, Solange</author><author>Clay, Ieuan</author><author>Jurisic, Giorgia</author><author>Tcymbarevich, Irina</author><author>Lang, Silvia</author><author>Ludwig, Marie-Gabrielle</author><author>Okoniewski, Michal</author><author>Eloranta, Jyrki J</author><author>Kullak-Ublick, Gerd A</author><author>Wagner, Carsten A</author><author>Rogler, Gerhard</author><author>Seuwen, Klaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The pH-sensing receptor OGR1 improves barrier function of epithelial cells and inhibits migration in an acidic environment</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology -

The precise molecular mechanism of the hyperpermeability response is not completely understood. Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, also known as breast tumor kinase BRK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase related to Src-family proteins. Although it has also been shown that PTK6 participates in regulating epithelial barrier function, the role of PTK6 in endothelial barrier function has not been reported. In this study, we hypothesized that PTK6 is (1) expressed in vascular endothelial cells, and (2) contributes to vascular endothelial hyperpermeability in response to TNFα. Results showed that PTK6 was detected in mouse endothelial cells at the level of protein and mRNA. In addition, PTK6 knockdown attenuated TNFα induced decrease in endothelial barrier function as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and in vitro transwell albumin-flux assays. Furthermore, we showed that TNFα treatment of endothelial cells increased active PTK6 association with p120-catenin at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Further analysis using immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that PTK6 knockdown attenuated TNFα induced VE-cadherin internalization as well as promoting its association with p120-catenin. Our study demonstrates a novel role of PTK6 in mediating endothelial barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl"

Function;TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Sin Nombre Hantavirus (SNV, Bunyaviridae Hantavirus) is a Category A pathogen that causes Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) with case fatality ratios generally ranging from 30% to 50%. HCPS is characterized by vascular leakage due to dysregulation of the endothelial barrier function. The loss of vascular integrity results in non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, shock, multi-organ failure and death. Using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) measurements, we found that plasma samples drawn from University of New Mexico Hospital patients with serologically-confirmed HCPS, induce loss of cell-cell adhesion in confluent epithelial and endothelial cell monolayers grown in ECIS cultureware. We show that the loss of cell-cell adhesion is sensitive to both thrombin and plasmin inhibitors in mild cases, and to thrombin only inhibition in severe cases, suggesting an increasing prothrombotic state with disease severity. A proteomic profile (2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) of HCPS plasma samples in our cohort revealed robust antifibrinolytic activity among terminal case patients. The prothrombotic activity is highlighted by acute ≥30 to &gt;100 fold increases in active plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) which, preceded death of the subjects within 48 h. Taken together, this suggests that PAI-1 might be a response to the severe pathology as it is expected to reduce plasmin activity and possibly thrombin activity in the terminal patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meng, Jingjing</author><author>Banerjee, Santanu</author><author>Li, Dan</author><author>Sindberg, Gregory M</author><author>Wang, Fuyuan</author><author>Ma, Jing</author><author>Roy, Sabita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Opioid Exacerbation of Gram-positive sepsis, induced by Gut Microbial Modulation, is Rescued by IL-17A Neutralization</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>10918</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep10918</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/srep10918</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rother, J</author><author>Richter, C</author><author>Turco, L</author><author>Knoch, F</author><author>Mey, I</author><author>Luther, S</author><author>Janshoff, a.</author><author>Bodenschatz, E</author><author>Tarantola, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crosstalk of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in co-cultures</title><secondary-title>Open Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>150038</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>cardiomyocytes</keyword><keyword>contractile function</keyword><keyword>electric cell-substrate</keyword><keyword>fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>fibrosis</keyword><keyword>impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>impedance spectroscopy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsob.150038</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsob.150038</url><url>http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/doi/10.1098/rsob.150038</url><url>http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsob.150038%5Cnhttp://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/do</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sambale, Franziska</author><author>Stahl, Frank</author><author>Rüdinger, Ferdinand</author><author>Seliktar, Dror</author><author>Kasper, Cornelia</author><author>Bahnemann, Detlef</author><author>Scheper, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iterative Cellular Screening System for Nanoparticle Safety Testing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nanomaterials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nanomaterials</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>2015</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2015/691069</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2015/691069/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Nanoparticles have the potential to exhibit risks to human beings and to the environment; due to the wide applications of nanoproducts, extensive risk management must not be neglected. Therefore, we have constructed a cell-based, iterative screening system to examine a variety of nanoproducts concerning their toxicity during development. The sensitivity and application of various cell-based methods were discussed and proven by applying the screening to two different nanoparticles: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. They were used as benchmarks to set up our methods and to examine their effects on mammalian cell lines. Different biological processes such as cell viability, gene expression of interleukin-8 and heat shock protein 70, as well as morphology changes were investigated. Within our screening system, both nanoparticle suspensions and coatings can be tested. Electric cell impedance measurements revealed to be a good method for online monitoring of cellular behavior. The implementation of three-dimensional cell culture is essential to better mimic in vivo conditions. In conclusion, our screening system is highly efficient, cost minimizing, and reduces the need for animal studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mirzapoiazova, Tamara</author><author>Lennon, Frances E</author><author>Mambetsariev, Bolot</author><author>Allen, Michael</author><author>Riehm, Jacob</author><author>Poroyko, Valeriy a</author><author>Singleton, Patrick a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracellular Vesicles from Caveolin-Enriched Microdomains Regulate Hyaluronan-Mediated Sustained Vascular Integrity</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Cell Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>2015</volume><keywords><keyword>10</keyword><keyword>11 pages</keyword><keyword>1155</keyword><keyword>2015</keyword><keyword>481493</keyword><keyword>article id 481493</keyword><keyword>biology</keyword><keyword>dawi publishing corporation</keyword><keyword>doi</keyword><keyword>dx</keyword><keyword>http</keyword><keyword>international journal of cell</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>volume 2015</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2015/481493</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2015/481493/</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function</label><abstract>Defects in vascular integrity are an initiating factor in several disease processes. We have previously reported that high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), a major glycosaminoglycan in the body, promotes rapid signal transduction in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC) leading to barrier enhancement. In contrast, low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA), produced in disease states by hyaluronidases and reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces HPMVEC barrier disruption. However, the mechanism(s) of sustained barrier regulation by HA are poorly defined. Our results indicate that long-term (6–24 hours) exposure of HMW-HA induced release of a novel type of extracellular vesicle from HLMVEC called enlargeosomes (characterized by AHNAK expression) while LMW-HA long-term exposure promoted release of exosomes (characterized by CD9, CD63, and CD81 expression). These effects were blocked by inhibiting caveolin-enriched microdomain (CEM) formation. Further, inhibiting enlargeosome release by annexin II siRNA attenuated the sustained barrier enhancing effects of HMW-HA. Finally, exposure of isolated enlargeosomes to HPMVEC monolayers generated barrier enhancement while exosomes led to barrier disruption. Taken together, these results suggest that differential release of extracellular vesicles from CEM modulate the sustained HPMVEC barrier regulation by HMW-HA and LMW-HA. HMW-HA-induced specialized enlargeosomes can be a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases involving impaired vascular integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borgas, Diana</author><author>Chambers, Eboni</author><author>Newton, Julie</author><author>Ko, Junsuk</author><author>Rivera, Stephanie</author><author>Rounds, Sharon</author><author>Lu, Qing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cigarette Smoke Disrupted Lung Endothelial Barrier Integrity and Increased Susceptibility to Acute Lung Injury via Histone Deacetylase 6</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>rcmb.2015-0149OC</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2015-0149OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1165/rcmb.2015-0149OC</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rom, Slava</author><author>Dykstra, Holly</author><author>Zuluaga-Ramirez, Viviana</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-98 and let-7g* protect the blood–brain barrier under neuroinflammatory conditions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/jcbfm.2015.154</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/jcbfm.2015.154</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cahoon, Judd M</author><author>Rai, Ruju R</author><author>Carroll, Lara S</author><author>Uehara, Hironori</author><author>Zhang, Xiaohui</author><author>O’Neil, Christina L</author><author>Medina, Reinhold J</author><author>Das, Subtrata K</author><author>Muddana, Santosh K</author><author>Olson, Paul R</author><author>Nielson, Spencer</author><author>Walker, Kortnie</author><author>Flood, Maggie M</author><author>Messenger, Wyatt B</author><author>Archer, Bonnie J</author><author>Barabas, Peter</author><author>Krizaj, David</author><author>Gibson, Christopher C</author><author>Li, Dean Y</author><author>Koh, Gou Y</author><author>Gao, Guangping</author><author>Stitt, Alan W</author><author>Ambati, Balamurali K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intravitreal AAV2.COMP-Ang1 Prevents Neurovascular Degeneration in a Murine Model of Diabetic Retinopathy</title><secondary-title>Diabetes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetes</full-title></periodical><pages>4247-4259</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2337/db14-1030</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.2337/db14-1030</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dhawan, S</author><author>Hiemstra, I H</author><author>Verseijden, C</author><author>Hilbers, F W</author><author>te Velde, A A</author><author>Willemsen, L E M</author><author>Stap, J</author><author>den Haan, J M</author><author>de Jonge, W J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cholinergic receptor activation on epithelia protects against cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Acta Physiologica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Physiologica</full-title></periodical><pages>846-859</pages><volume>213</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/apha.12469</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/apha.12469</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gibson, C C</author><author>Zhu, W</author><author>Davis, C T</author><author>Bowman-Kirigin, J A</author><author>Chan, A C</author><author>Ling, J</author><author>Walker, A E</author><author>Goitre, L</author><author>Delle Monache, S</author><author>Retta, S F</author><author>Shiu, Y.-T.

Barrier Function;Inflammation</label><abstract>Protective effects of prostacyclin (PC) or its stable analog beraprost against agonist-induced lung vascular inflammation have been associated with elevation of intracellular cAMP and Rac GTPase signaling which inhibited the RhoA GTPase-dependent pathway of endothelial barrier dysfunction. This study investigated a distinct mechanism of PC-stimulated lung vascular endothelial (EC) barrier recovery and resolution of LPS-induced inflammation mediated by small GTPase Rap1. Efficient barrier recovery was observed in LPS-challenged pulmonary EC after prostacyclin administration even after 15 h of initial inflammatory insult and was accompanied by the significant attenuation of p38 MAP kinase and NFκB signaling and decreased production of IL-8 and soluble ICAM1. These effects were reproduced in cells post-treated with 8CPT, a small molecule activator of Rap1-specific nucleotide exchange factor Epac. By contrast, pharmacologic Epac inhibitor, Rap1 knockdown, or knockdown of cell junction-associated Rap1 effector afadin attenuated EC recovery caused by PC or 8CPT post-treatment. The key role of Rap1 in lung barrier restoration was further confirmed in the murine model of LPS-induced acute lung injury. Lung injury was monitored by measurements of bronchoalveolar lavage protein content, cell count, and Evans blue extravasation and live imaging of vascular leak over 6 days using a fluorescent tracer. The data showed significant acceleration of lung recovery by PC and 8CPT post-treatment, which was abrogated in Rap1a−/− mice. These results suggest that post-treatment with PC triggers the Epac/Rap1/afadin-dependent mechanism of endothelial barrier restoration and downregulation of p38MAPK and NFκB inflammatory cascades, altogether leading to accelerated lung recovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suresh, Karthik</author><author>Servinsky, Laura</author><author>Reyes, Jose</author><author>Baksh, Syeda</author><author>Undem, Clark</author><author>Caterina, Michael</author><author>Pearse, David B</author><author>Shimoda, Larissa A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrogen peroxide-induced calcium influx in lung microvascular endothelial cells involves TRPV4</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>L1467-L1477</pages><volume>309</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/ajplung.00275.2015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ajplung.physiology.org/lookup/doi/10.1152/ajplung.00275.2015</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Üllen, Andreas</author><author>Nusshold, Christoph</author><author>Glasnov, Toma</author><author>Saf, Robert</author><author>Cantillo, David</author><author>Eibinger, Gerald</author><author>Reicher, Helga</author><author>Fauler, Günter</author><author>Bernhart, Eva</author><author>Hallstrom, Seth</author><author>Kogelnik, Nora</author><author>Zangger, Klaus</author><author>Oliver Kappe, C</author><author>Malle, Ernst</author><author>Sattler, Wolfgang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Covalent adduct formation between the plasmalogen-derived modification product 2-chlorohexadecanal and phloretin</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>470-481</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bcp.2014.12.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000629521400731X</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, Lopamudra</author><author>Das, Soumen</author><author>Chatterjee, Jyotirmoy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical Bioimpedance Analysis: A New Method in Cervical Cancer Screening</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>2015</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2015/636075</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jme/2015/636075/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer worldwide and a disease of concern due to its high rate of incidence of about 500,000 women annually and is responsible for about 280,000 deaths in a year. The mortality and morbidity of cervical cancer are reduced through mass screening via Pap smear, but this technique suffers from very high false negativity of around 30% to 40% and hence the sensitivity of this technique is not more than 60%. Electrical bioimpedance study employing cytosensors over a frequency range offers instantaneous and quantitative means to monitor cellular events and is an upcoming technique in real time to classify cells as normal and abnormal ones. This technology is exploited for label-free detection of diseases by identifying and measuring nonbiological parameters of the cell which may carry the disease signature.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

nanoparticles are widely used for many applications. In this study silver nanoparticles have been tested for their toxic effect on fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), on a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A-549), on PC-12-cells, a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line, and on HEP-G2-cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The viability of the cells cultivated with different concentrations of silver was determined by the MTT assay, a photometric method to determine cell metabolism. Dose-response curves were extrapolated and IC 50 , total lethal concentration (TLC), and no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) values were calculated for each cell line. As another approach, ECIS (electric-cell-substrate-impedance-sensing) an automated method to monitor cellular behavior in real-time was applied to observe cells cultivated with silver nanoparticles. To identify the type of cell death the membrane integrity was analyzed by measurements of the lactate dehydrogenase releases and by determination of the caspase 3/7 activity. To ensure that the cytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticles is not traced back to the presence of Ag + ions in the suspension, an Ag + salt (AgNO 3 ) has been examined at the same concentration of Ag + present in the silver nanoparticle suspension that is assuming that the Ag particles are completely available as Ag + ions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kispert, Shannon</author><author>Marentette, John</author><author>McHowat, Jane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cigarette smoke induces cell motility via platelet-activating factor accumulation in breast cancer cells: a potential mechanism for metastatic disease</title><secondary-title>Physiological Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>e12318-e12318</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Physiological Reports</publisher><accession-num>25802360</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.14814/phy2.12318</electronic-resource-num><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://physreports.physiology.org/content/3/3/e12318.abstract</url><url>http://physreports.physiology.org/cgi/doi/10.14814/phy2.12318</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Most cancer deaths are a result of metastasis rather than the primary tumor. Although cigarette smoking has been determined as a risk factor for several cancers, its role in metastasis has not been studied in detail. We propose that cigarette smoking contributes to metastatic disease via inhibition of breast cancer cell platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), resulting in PAF accumulation and a subsequent increase in cell motility. We studied several breast cell lines, including immortalized mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A), luminal A hormone positive MCF-7, basal-like triple negative MDA-MB-468, and claudin-low triple-negative highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. We exposed cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for up to 48 h. CSE inhibited PAF-AH activity, increased PAF accumulation, and increased cell motility in MDA-MB-231 metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells. The calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) inhibitor, (S) bromoenol lactone ((S)-BEL) was used to prevent the accumulation of PAF and further prevented the increase in cell motility seen previously when cells were exposed to CSE. Thus, iPLA2 or PAF may represent a therapeutic target to manage metastatic disease, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer patients who smoke.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boratkó, Anita</author><author>Péter, Margit</author><author>Thalwieser, Zsófia</author><author>Kovács, Előd</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Elongation factor-1A1 is a novel substrate of the protein phosphatase 1-TIMAP complex</title><secondary-title>The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp;

Pretreatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors suggested that the uptake of nanoparticles was largely due to receptor-independent pathways or spontaneous entry for carboxylated and zwitterionic QDs, while for amine-functionalized particles involvement of cholesterol-enriched membrane domains is conceivable. Cysteamine-QDs were found to be the least cytotoxic, while D-penicillamine-QDs reduced the mitochondrial activity of MDCKII by 20-25%. Although the cell vitality appeared unaffected (assessed from the changes in mitochondrial activity using a classical MTS assay after 24 h of exposure), the binding of QDs to the cellular interior and their movement across cytoskeletal filaments (captured and characterized by single-particle tracking), was shown to compromise the integrity of the cytoskeletal and plasma membrane dynamics, as evidenced by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

AbstractAlveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells are a key structure and defender in the lung but also are the targets in many lung diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilator‐induced lung injury, and pulmonary fibrosis. We sought to establish an optimized method for high yielding and long maintenance of characteristics of primary human AEII cells to facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms of lung diseases at the cellular and molecular levels. Adult human peripheral normal lung tissues of oncologic patients undergoing lung resection were collected. The AEII cells were isolated and identified by the expression of pro‐surfactant protein (SP)C, epithelial sodium channel (αENaC) and cytokeratin (CK)‐8, the lamellar bodies specific for AEII cells, and confirmed by the histology using electron microscopy. The phenotype of AEII cells was characterized by the expression of surfactant proteins (SP‐A, SP‐B, SP‐C, SP‐D), CK‐8, KL‐6, αENaC, and aquaporin (AQP)‐3, which was maintained over 20 days. The biological activity of the primary human AEII cells producing SP‐C, cytokines, and intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 was vigorous in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor‐α. We have modified previous methods and optimized a method for isolation of high purity and long maintenance of the human AEII cell phenotype in primary culture. This method provides an important tool for studies aiming at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of lung diseases exclusively in AEII cells.

In the current work, it was found that depletion of the prometastatic protein, NEDD9, in breast cancer cells results in a significant decrease in individual cell migration due to impaired trafficking of ligand-bound integrins. NEDD9 deficiency does not affect the expression or internalization of integrins but heightens caveolae-dependent trafficking of ligand-bound integrins to early endosomes. Increase in mobility of ligand-bound integrins is concomitant with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (CAV1) and volume of CAV1-vesicles. NEDD9 directly binds to CAV1 and colocalizes within CAV1 vesicles. In the absence of NEDD9, the trafficking of ligand-bound integrins from early to late endosomes is impaired, resulting in a significant decrease in degradation of ligand-integrin complexes and an increase in recycling of ligand-bound integrins from early endosomes back to the plasma membrane without ligand disengagement, thus leading to low adhesion and migration. Reexpression of NEDD9 or decrease in the amount of active, tyrosine 14 phosphorylated (Tyr14) CAV1 in NEDD9-depleted cells rescues the integrin trafficking deficiency and restores cellular adhesion and migration capacity. Collectively, these findings indicate that NEDD9 orchestrates trafficking of ligand-bound integrins through the attenuation of CAV1 activity.\n\nIMPLICATIONS: This study provides valuable new insight into the potential therapeutic benefit of NEDD9 depletion to reduce dissemination of tumor cells and discovers a new regulatory role of NEDD9 in promoting migration through modulation of CAV1-dependent trafficking of integrins.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Yinghong</author><author>Sonnenwald, Tanja</author><author>Sprenger, Adrian</author><author>Hansen, Uwe</author><author>Dengjel, Joern</author><author>Bruckner-Tuderman, Leena</author><author>Schmidt, Gudula</author><author>Has, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RhoA activation by CNFy restores cell-cell adhesion in kindlin-2-deficient keratinocytes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>269-280</pages><volume>233</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>actin</keyword><keyword>blistering</keyword><keyword>epidermal adhesion</keyword><keyword>epidermal barrier</keyword><keyword>integrin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24615351</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/path.4350</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>Cell Morphology;Cell-Cell Adhesion;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Kindlins are a family of integrin adapter and cell-matrix adhesion proteins causally linked to human genetic disorders. Kindlin-2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein with manifold functions and interactions. The contribution of kindlin-2 to integrin-based cell-matrix adhesions has been extensively explored, while other integrin-independent roles emerge. Because of the early involvement of kindlin-2 in development, no viable animal models with its constitutional knockout are available to study its physiological functions in adult skin. Here, we uncovered a critical physiological role of kindlin-2 in the epidermis by using a skin-equivalent model with shRNA-mediated knock-down of kindlin-2 in keratinocytes. Kindlin-2-deficient keratinocytes built stratified epidermal layers, but displayed impaired dermal-epidermal and intra-epidermal adhesion and barrier function. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that kindlin-2 interacts with both integrin- and cadherin-based adhesions. In kindlin-2-deficient keratinocytes, reduced cell-cell adhesion was associated with abnormal cytoplasmic distribution of adherens junctions and desmosomal proteins, which was dependent on RhoA activation. Direct activation of RhoA with recombinant bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor y (CNFy) reverted the abnormal phenotype and barrier function of kindlin-2-deficient keratinocytes and skin equivalents. These findings have physiological and pathological significance, since kindlin-2 expression modulates the phenotype in Kindler syndrome, a skin fragility disorder caused by kindlin-1 deficiency. Our results suggest that pharmacological regulation of RhoGTPase activity may represent a therapeutic option for skin fragility.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Jun</author><author>Martin, Tracey A.</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Jiang, Wen G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FAP-α (Fibroblast activation protein-α) is involved in the control of human breast cancer cell line growth and motility via the FAK pathway</title><secondary-title>BMC Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cell Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast Cancer</keyword><keyword>FAK</keyword><keyword>FAP-α</keyword><keyword>Growth</keyword><keyword>Migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24885257</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2121-15-16</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/15/16</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Background: Fibroblast Activation Protein alpha (FAP-α) or seprase is an integral membrane serine peptidase. Previous work has not satisfactorily explained both the suppression and promotion effects that have been observed in cancer. The purpose of this work was to investigate the role of FAP-α in human breast cancer. Expression of FAP-α was characterized in primary tumour samples and in cell lines, along with the effects of FAP-α expression on in vitro growth, invasion, attachment and migration. Furthermore the potential interaction of FAP-α with other signalling pathways was investigated.Results: FAP-α was significantly increased in patients with poor outcome and survival. In vitro results showed that breast cancer cells over expressing FAP-α had increased growth ability and impaired migratory ability. The growth of MDA-MB-231 cells and the adhesion and invasion ability of both MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were not dramatically influenced by FAP-α expression. Over-expression of FAP-α resulted in a reduction of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) level in both cells cultured in normal media and serum-free media. An inhibitor to FAK restored the reduced motility ability of both MCF-7exp cells and MDA-MB-231exp cells and prevented the change in phosphorylated FAK levels. However, inhibitors to PI3K, ERK, PLCΥ{hooked} , NWASP, ARP2/3, and ROCK had no influence this.Conclusions: FAP-α in significantly associated with poor outcome in patients with breast cancer. In vitro, FAP-α promotes proliferation and inhibits migration of breast cancer cells, potentially by regulating the FAK pathway. These results suggest FAP-α could be a target for future therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Feng</author><author>Kumar, Sanjiv</author><author>Yu, Yanfang</author><author>Aggarwal, Saurabh</author><author>Gross, Christine</author><author>Wang, Yusi</author><author>Chakraborty, Trinad</author><author>Verin, Alexander D.</author><author>Catravas, John D.</author><author>Lucas, Rudolf</author><author>Black, Stephen M.</author><author>Fulton, David J.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PKC-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at T495 regulates eNOS coupling and endothelial barrier function in response to G+ -toxins</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25020117</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0099823</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25020117/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Gram positive (G+) infections make up ∼50% of all acute lung injury cases which are characterized by extensive permeability edema secondary to disruption of endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity. A primary cause of increased permeability are cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) of G +-bacteria, such as pneumolysin (PLY) and listeriolysin-O (LLO) which create plasma membrane pores, promoting Ca2+-influx and activation of PKCα. In human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, ETU reduced the ability of LLO to increase microvascular cell permeability suggesting an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent mechanism. LLO stimulated superoxide production from HLMVEC and this was prevented by silencing PKCα or NOS inhibition suggesting a link between these pathways. Both LLO and PLY stimulated eNOS T495 phosphorylation in a PKC-dependent manner. Expression of a phosphomimetic T495D eNOS (human isoform) resulted in increased superoxide and diminished nitric oxide (NO) production. Transduction of HLMVEC with an active form of PKCα resulted in the robust phosphorylation of T495 and increased peroxynitrite production, indicative of eNOS uncoupling. To determine the mechanisms underlying eNOS uncoupling, HLMVEC were stimulated with LLO and the amount of hsp90 and caveolin-1 bound to eNOS determined. LLO stimulated the dissociation of hsp90, and in particular, caveolin-1 from eNOS. Both hsp90 and caveolin-1 have been shown to influence eNOS uncoupling and a peptide mimicking the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 blocked the ability of PKCα to stimulate eNOS-derived superoxide. Collectively, these results suggest that the G+ pore-forming toxins promote increased EC permeability via activation of PKCα, phosphorylation of eNOS-T495, loss of hsp90 and caveolin-1 binding which collectively promote eNOS uncoupling and the production of barrier disruptive superoxide.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pink, Anne</author><author>Kallastu, Aili</author><author>Turkina, Marina</author><author>Skolnaja, Marianna</author><author>Kogerman, Priit</author><author>Päll, Taavi</author><author>Valkna, Andres</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Purification, characterization and plasma half-life of PEGylated soluble recombinant non-HA-binding CD44</title><secondary-title>BioDrugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioDrugs</full-title></periodical><pages>393-402</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24567264</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40259-014-0089-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40259-014-0089-y</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to increase the serum half-life of recombinant CD44 hyaluronan (HA) binding domain by PEGylation. We have previously found that recombinant soluble CD44 HA binding domain (CD44HABD) and its non-HA-binding triple mutant CD44HABDR41AY78SY79S (CD44-3MUT) inhibits angiogenesis and subcutaneous tumor growth. However, this ∼12 kDa recombinant protein displays a high serum clearance rate. Methods: Here, we report the purification of monomeric CD44-3MUT from urea solubilized inclusion bodies using weak anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. To increase the serum residence time of CD44-3MUT we PEGylated the resulting protein using 20 kDa methoxy-PEG-propionaldehyde. Results: PEGylation of CD44-3MUT prolonged its in vivo serum half-life about 70-fold from 0.03 to 1.8 hours. Along with extended plasma residence time, PEGylation also increased the systemic exposure. By cell impedance assay we confirmed that PEGylated CD44-3MUT maintained its in vitro function. The results from the impedance assay additionally demonstrate that the CD44-3MUT effect on endothelial cells is mediated by vimentin. Conclusions: In summary, we have developed a purification protocol for large-scale production of CD44-3MUT and generated a PEGylated form of CD44-3MUT. HA binding domain of CD44(CD44HABD) and its modified non-HA binding form (CD44-3MUT) inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo without disturbing HA-binding functions. CD44-3MUT has been PEGylated for use as a new type of anti-angiogenic human drug. PEGylation of CD44-3MUT improved pharmacokinetic properties but retains its functional activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szulcek, Robert</author><author>Bogaard, Harm Jan</author><author>van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing for the quantification of endothelial proliferation, barrier function, and motility</title><secondary-title>Journal of Visualized Experiments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Visualized Experiments</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><issue>85</issue><keywords><keyword>Bioengineering</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesions</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Barrier</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Impedance Spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Issue 85</keyword><keyword>Migration</keyword><keyword>Motility</keyword><keyword>Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Resistance</keyword><keyword>TEER</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/51300</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing for the quantification of endothelial proliferation, barrier function, and motility.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4159052/pdf/jove-85-51300.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>Attachment;Barrier Function;Micromotion;Migration;Modeling;Proliferation;Theory;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) is an in vitro impedance measuring system to quantify the behavior of cells within adherent cell layers. To this end, cells are grown in special culture chambers on top of opposing, circular gold electrodes. A constant small alternating current is applied between the electrodes and the potential across is measured. The insulating properties of the cell membrane create a resistance towards the electrical current flow resulting in an increased electrical potential between the electrodes. Measuring cellular impedance in this manner allows the automated study of cell attachment, growth, morphology, function, and motility. Although the ECIS measurement itself is straightforward and easy to learn, the underlying theory is complex and selection of the right settings and correct analysis and interpretation of the data is not self-evident. Yet, a clear protocol describing the individual steps from the experimental design to preparation, realization, and analysis of the experiment is not available. In this article the basic measurement principle as well as possible applications, experimental considerations, advantages and limitations of the ECIS system are discussed. A guide is provided for the study of cell attachment, spreading and proliferation; quantification of cell behavior in a confluent layer, with regard to barrier function, cell motility, quality of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions; and quantification of wound healing and cellular responses to vasoactive stimuli. Representative results are discussed based on human microvascular (MVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), but are applicable to all adherent growing cells. © JoVE 2006-2014.

Tight regulation of PKA function can be achieved by discrete compartmentalization of the enzyme via physical interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Here, we investigated the role of AKAPs 220 and 12 in endothelial barrier regulation. Analysis of human and mouse microvascular endothelial cells as well as isolated rat mesenteric microvessels was performed using TAT-Ahx-AKAPis peptide, designed to competitively inhibit PKA-AKAP interaction. In vivo microvessel hydraulic conductivity and in vitro transendothelial electrical resistance measurements showed that this peptide destabilized endothelial barrier properties, and dampened the cAMP-mediated endothelial barrier stabilization induced by forskolin and rolipram. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TAT-Ahx-AKAPis led to both adherens junctions and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Those effects were paralleled by redistribution of PKA and Rac1 from endothelial junctions and by Rac1 inactivation. Similarly, membrane localization of AKAP220 was also reduced. In addition, depletion of either AKAP12 or AKAP220 significantly impaired endothelial barrier function and AKAP12 was also shown to interfere with cAMP-mediated barrier enhancement. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that AKAP220 interacts not only with PKA but also with VE-cadherin and ß-catenin. Taken together, these results indicate that AKAP-mediated PKA subcellular compartmentalization is involved in endothelial barrier regulation. More specifically, AKAP220 and AKAP12 contribute to endothelial barrier function and AKAP12 is required for cAMP-mediated barrier stabilization.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Zhou, Xia</author><author>Li, Changsheng</author><author>Yan, Suhua</author><author>Deng, Xianming</author><author>Cao, Zhiqun</author><author>Li, Liqun</author><author>Tang, Bo</author><author>Allen, Thaddeus D</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dihydroartemisinin targets VEGFR2 via the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells to inhibit angiogenesis</title><secondary-title>Cancer Biology &amp; Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Biology &amp; Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1479-1488</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/15384047.2014.955728</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384047.2014.955728</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Guo, Fang</author><author>Li, Liqun</author><author>Guo, Ling</author><author>Hou, Yinglong</author><author>Hao, Enkui</author><author>Yan, Suhua</author><author>Allen, Thaddeus D.</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cadmium induces vascular permeability via activation of the p38 MAPK pathway</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>447-452</pages><volume>450</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.05.140</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X14010456</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hussein, Khaled A</author><author>Choksi, Karishma</author><author>Akeel, Sara</author><author>Ahmad, Saif</author><author>Megyerdi, Sylvia</author><author>El-Sherbiny, Mohamed</author><author>Nawaz, Mohamed</author><author>Abu El-Asrar, Ahmed</author><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bone morphogenetic protein 2: a potential new player in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.</title><secondary-title>Experimental eye research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental eye research</full-title></periodical><pages>79-88</pages><volume>125</volume><keywords><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Ependymoglial Cells</keyword><keyword>Ependymoglial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Ependymoglial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Experimental</keyword><keyword>Experimental: etiology</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Retina</keyword><keyword>Retina: cytology</keyword><keyword>Retina: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vitreous Body</keyword><keyword>Vitreous Body: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24910902</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2014.05.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910902</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus. Vision loss in DR principally occurs due to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), leading to macular edema, retinal detachment and inner retinal and vitreous hemorrhage. Several growth factors have been shown to play crucial role in the development of these vascular changes; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DR are not yet fully revealed. In the current study we investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) in DR. We examined the changes in the protein levels of BMP2 in human vitreous and retina in addition to the mouse retina of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To detect the source of BMP2 during diabetes, human retinal endothelial cells (hRECs) were subjected to high glucose (HG) for 5 days and levels of BMP2 protein were analyzed in conditioned media of these cells relative to control. We also evaluated the effect of BMP2 on the levels of VEGF in cultured rat Müller cells (rMC1). In addition, we tested the pro-inflammatory effects of BMP2 by examining its effect on leukocyte adhesion to cultured hRECs, and levels of adhesion molecules and cytokines production. Finally, the effect of different concentrations of BMP2 on permeability of confluent monolayer of hRECs was evaluated using FITC-Dextran flux permeability assay and by measuring Transcellular Electrical Resistance (TER) using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS). Our results show, for the first time, the up-regulation of BMP2 in diabetic human and mouse retinas in addition to its detection in vitreous of patients with proliferative DR (72 ± 7 pg/ml). In vitro, hRECs showed upregulation of BMP2 in HG conditions suggesting that these cells are a potential source of BMP2 in diabetic conditions. Furthermore, BMP2 induced VEGF secretion by Müller cells in-vitro; and showed a dose response in increasing permeability of cultured hRECs. Meanwhile, BMP2 pro-inflammatory effects were recognized by its ability to induce leukocyte adhesion to the hRECs, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and upregulation of interleukin-6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8). These results show that BMP2 could be a contributing growth factor to the development of microvascular dysfunction during DR via enhancing both pro-angiogenic and inflammatory pathways. Our findings suggest BMP2 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent/treat DR.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gong, Haixia</author><author>Gao, Xiaopei</author><author>Feng, Shaoting</author><author>Siddiqui, M Rizwan</author><author>Garcia, Alexander</author><author>Bonini, Marcelo G</author><author>Komarova, Yulia</author><author>Vogel, Stephen M</author><author>Mehta, Dolly</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence of a common mechanism of disassembly of adherens junctions through Gα13 targeting of VE-cadherin.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>579-591</pages><volume>211</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Biotinylation</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Evans Blue</keyword><keyword>G12-G13</keyword><keyword>G12-G13: deficiency</keyword><keyword>G12-G13: metabolism</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>src</keyword><keyword>src: genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24590762</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1084/jem.20131190</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3949568&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Inflammation</label><abstract>The heterotrimeric G protein Gα13 transduces signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to induce cell spreading, differentiation, migration, and cell polarity. Here, we describe a novel GPCR-independent function of Gα13 in regulating the stability of endothelial cell adherens junctions (AJs). We observed that the oxidant H2O2, which is released in response to multiple proinflammatory mediators, induced the interaction of Gα13 with VE-cadherin. Gα13 binding to VE-cadherin in turn induced Src activation and VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Tyr 658, the p120-catenin binding site thought to be responsible for VE-cadherin internalization. Inhibition of Gα13-VE-cadherin interaction using an interfering peptide derived from the Gα13 binding motif on VE-cadherin abrogated the disruption of AJs in response to inflammatory mediators. These studies identify a unique role of Gα13 binding to VE-cadherin in mediating VE-cadherin internalization and endothelial barrier disruption and inflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Ling</author><author>Dong, Fengyun</author><author>Hou, Yinglong</author><author>Cai, Weidong</author><author>Zhou, Xia</author><author>Huang, Ai-Ling</author><author>Yang, Min</author><author>Allen, Thaddeus D</author><author>Liu, Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dihydroartemisinin inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-independent pathway.</title><secondary-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1707-1712</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25371719</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/etm.2014.1997</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4217775&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, has been demonstrated to possess a strong antiangiogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Endothelial cell (EC) migration is an essential component of angiogenesis, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays a key role in the regulation of migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of DHA on EC migration and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were treated with DHA and VEGF-induced migration was analyzed. The activation of p38 MAPK was detected by western blot analysis, and the migration assays were performed with a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203850. It was revealed that 20 μM DHA significantly reduced EC migration in the transwell migration assay, wound healing assay and electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing real-time analysis. However, DHA did not affect p38 MAPK phosphorylation or expression. In the absence or presence of SB203850, DHA induced a similar proportional reduction of EC migration in the three migration assays. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that DHA inhibits VEGF-induced EC migration via a p38 MAPK-independent pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Lixiang</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Xu, Jianli</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of fibroblast activation protein on osteosarcoma cell lines in vitro.</title><secondary-title>Oncology letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology letters</full-title></periodical><pages>699-704</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24520291</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ol.2014.1788</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3919928&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) or seprase, which belongs to the group type II integral serine proteases, is an integral membrane serine peptidase.

T84 human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers were incubated with 4 β2→1-fructan formulations of different chain-length compositions and were stimulated with the proinflammatory phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was analyzed by electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) as a measure for tight junction-mediated barrier function. To confirm TLR2 involvement in barrier modulation by β2→1-fructans, ECIS experiments were repeated using TLR2 blocking antibody. After preincubation of T84 cells with short-chain β2→1-fructans, the decrease in TEER as induced by PMA (62.3 ± 5.2%, P &lt; 0.001) was strongly attenuated (15.2 ± 8.8%, P &lt; 0.01). However, when PMA was applied first, no effect on recovery was observed during addition of the fructans. By blocking TLR2 on the T84 cells, the protective effect of short-chain β2→1-fructans was substantially inhibited. Stimulation of human embryonic kidney human TLR2 reporter cells with β2→1-fructans induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, confirming that β2→1-fructans are specific ligands for TLR2. To conclude, β2→1-fructans exert time-dependent and chain length-dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell barrier mediated via TLR2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on intestinal epithelial cells could be a target of β2→1-fructan-mediated health effects.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amsellem, Valerie</author><author>Dryden, Nicola H</author><author>Martinelli, Roberta</author><author>Gavins, Felicity</author><author>Almagro, Lourdes Osuna</author><author>Birdsey, Graeme M</author><author>Haskard, Dorian O</author><author>Mason, Justin C</author><author>Turowski, Patric</author><author>Randi, Anna M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ICAM-2 regulates vascular permeability and N-cadherin localization through ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins and Rac-1 signalling.</title><secondary-title>Cell communication and signaling : CCS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell communication and signaling : CCS</full-title></periodical><pages>12</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell-cell junctions</keyword><keyword>ERM</keyword><keyword>Endothelial</keyword><keyword>ICAM-2</keyword><keyword>N-Cadherin</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Rac-1</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cell-cell junctions</keyword><keyword>endothelial</keyword><keyword>erm</keyword><keyword>icam-2</keyword><keyword>n-cadherin</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>rac-1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Cell Communication and Signaling</publisher><accession-num>24593809</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1478-811X-12-12</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4015342&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Endothelial junctions control functions such as permeability, angiogenesis and contact inhibition. VE-Cadherin (VECad) is essential for the maintenance of intercellular contacts. In confluent endothelial monolayers, N-Cadherin (NCad) is mostly expressed on the apical and basal membrane, but in the absence of VECad it localizes at junctions. Both cadherins are required for vascular development. The intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-2, also localized at endothelial junctions, is involved in leukocyte recruitment and angiogenesis. RESULTS: In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), both VECad and NCad were found at nascent cell contacts of sub-confluent monolayers, but only VECad localized at the mature junctions of confluent monolayers. Inhibition of ICAM-2 expression by siRNA caused the appearance of small gaps at the junctions and a decrease in NCad junctional staining in sub-confluent monolayers. Endothelioma lines derived from WT or ICAM-2-deficient mice (IC2neg) lacked VECad and failed to form junctions, with loss of contact inhibition. Re-expression of full-length ICAM-2 (IC2 FL) in IC2neg cells restored contact inhibition through recruitment of NCad at the junctions. Mutant ICAM-2 lacking the binding site for ERM proteins (IC2 ΔERM) or the cytoplasmic tail (IC2 ΔTAIL) failed to restore junctions. ICAM-2-dependent Rac-1 activation was also decreased in these mutant cell lines. Barrier function, measured in vitro via transendothelial electrical resistance, was decreased in IC2neg cells, both in resting conditions and after thrombin stimulation. This was dependent on ICAM-2 signalling to the small GTPase Rac-1, since transendothelial electrical resistance of IC2neg cells was restored by constitutively active Rac-1. In vivo, thrombin-induced extravasation of FITC-labeled albumin measured by intravital fluorescence microscopy in the mouse cremaster muscle showed that permeability was increased in ICAM-2-deficient mice compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ICAM-2 regulates endothelial barrier function and permeability through a pathway involving N-Cadherin, ERMs and Rac-1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beasley, Selina</author><author>El-Sherbiny, Mohamed</author><author>Megyerdi, Sylvia</author><author>El-Shafey, Sally</author><author>Choksi, Karishma</author><author>Kaddour-Djebbar, Ismail</author><author>Sheibani, Nader</author><author>Hsu, Stephen</author><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Caspase-14 expression impairs retinal pigment epithelium barrier function: potential role in diabetic macular edema.</title><secondary-title>BioMed research international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioMed research international</full-title></periodical><pages>417986</pages><volume>2014</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25121097</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2014/417986</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4119899&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We recently showed that caspase-14 is a novel molecule in retina with potential role in accelerated vascular cell death during diabetic retinopathy (DR). Here, we evaluated whether caspase-14 is implicated in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) dysfunction under hyperglycemia. The impact of high glucose (HG, 30 mM D-glucose) on caspase-14 expression in human RPE (ARPE-19) cells was tested, which showed significant increase in caspase-14 expression compared with normal glucose (5 mM D-glucose + 25 mM L-glucose). We also evaluated the impact of modulating caspase-14 expression on RPE cells barrier function, phagocytosis, and activation of other caspases using ARPE-19 cells transfected with caspase-14 plasmid or caspase-14 siRNA. We used FITC-dextran flux assay and electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to test the changes in RPE cell barrier function. Similar to HG, caspase-14 expression in ARPE-19 cells increased FITC-dextran leakage through the confluent monolayer and decreased the transcellular electrical resistance (TER). These effects of HG were prevented by caspase-14 knockdown. Furthermore, caspase-14 knockdown prevented the HG-induced activation of caspase-1 and caspase-9, the only activated caspases by HG. Phagocytic activity was unaffected by caspase-14 expression. Our results suggest that caspase-14 contributes to RPE cell barrier disruption under hyperglycemic conditions and thus plays a role in the development of diabetic macular edema.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kling, Beata</author><author>Bücherl, Daniel</author><author>Palatzky, Peter</author><author>Matysik, Frank-Michael</author><author>Decker, Michael</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Heilmann, Jörg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flavonoids, flavonoid metabolites, and phenolic acids inhibit oxidative stress in the neuronal cell line HT-22 monitored by ECIS and MTT assay: a comparative study.</title><secondary-title>Journal of natural products</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of natural products</full-title></periodical><pages>446-454</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biomolecular</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cultured: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus: cytology</keyword><keyword>Hydroxybenzoates</keyword><keyword>Hydroxybenzoates: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Hydroxybenzoates: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Molecular Structure</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Quercetin</keyword><keyword>Quercetin: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24245939</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/np400518k</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24245939</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A real-time and label-free in vitro assay based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was established, validated, and compared to an end-point MTT assay within an experimental trial addressing the cytoprotective effects of 19 different flavonoids, flavonoid metabolites, and phenolic acids and their methyl esters on the HT-22 neuronal cell line, after induction of oxidative stress with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Among the flavonoids under study, only those with a catechol unit and an additional 4-keto group provided cytoprotection. The presence of a 2,3-double bond was not a structural prerequisite for a neuroprotective effect. In the case of the phenolics, catechol substitution was the only structural requirement for activity. The flavonoids and other phenolics with a ferulic acid substitution or a single hydroxy group showed no activity. Electrochemical characterization of all compounds via square-wave voltammetry provided a rather specific correlation between cytoprotective activity and redox potential for the active flavonoids, but not for the active phenolics with a low molecular weight. Moreover this study was used to compare label-free ECIS recordings with results of the established MTT assay. Whereas the former provides time-resolved and thus entirely unbiased information on changes of cell morphology that are unequivocally associated with cell death, the latter requires predefined exposure times and a strict causality between metabolic activity and cell death. However, MTT assays are based on standard lab equipment and provide a more economic way to higher throughput.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sumpio, Brandon Bauer Brandon Bauer</author><author>Chitragari, Gautham</author><author>Moriguchi, Takeshi</author><author>Shalaby, Sherif</author><author>Pappas-Brown, Valeria</author><author>Khan, Asif</author><author>Sekaran, Shamala</author><author>Sumpio, Brandon Bauer Brandon Bauer</author><author>Grab, Dennis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>African Trypanosome-Induced Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction under Shear Stress May Not Require ERK Activation</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Angiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Angiology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>African trypanosomes - blood–brain barrier - brain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-0034-1370890</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0034-1370890</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>African trypanosomes are tsetse fly transmitted protozoan parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis, a disease characterized by a plethora of neurological symptoms and death. How the parasites under microvascular shear stress (SS) flow conditions in the brain cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is not known. In vitro studies using static models comprised of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) show that BBB activation and crossing by trypanosomes requires the orchestration of parasite cysteine proteases and host calcium-mediated cell signaling. Here, we examine BMEC barrier function and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and ERK5, mitogen-activated protein kinase family regulators of microvascular permeability, under static and laminar SS flow and in the context of trypanosome infection. Confluent human BMEC were cultured in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and parallel-plate glass slide chambers. The human BMEC were exposed to 2 or 14 dyn/cm2 SS in the presence or absence of trypanosomes. Real-time changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) were monitored and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and ERK5 analyzed by immunoblot assay. After reaching confluence under static conditions human BMEC TEER was found to rapidly increase when exposed to 2 dyn/cm2 SS, a condition that mimics SS in brain postcapillary venules. Addition of African trypanosomes caused a rapid drop in human BMEC TEER. Increasing SS to 14 dyn/cm2, a condition mimicking SS in brain capillaries, led to a transient increase in TEER in both control and infected human BMEC. However, no differences in ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation were found under any condition tested. African trypanosomiasis alters BBB permeability under low shear conditions through an ERK1/2 and ERK5 independent pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hamers, Anouk A J</author><author>Uleman, Sven</author><author>van Tiel, Claudia M</author><author>Kruijswijk, Daniëlle</author><author>van Stalborch, Anne-Marieke</author><author>Huveneers, Stephan</author><author>de Vries, Carlie J M</author><author>van 't Veer, Cornelis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limited role of nuclear receptor Nur77 in Escherichia coli-induced peritonitis.</title><secondary-title>Infection and immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and immunity</full-title></periodical><pages>253-264</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Load</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Infections: pathology</keyword><keyword>Group A</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Liver: cytology</keyword><keyword>Liver: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Lung: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: cytology</keyword><keyword>Member 1</keyword><keyword>Member 1: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Member 1: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: cytology</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Periodontitis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Peritoneal Cavity</keyword><keyword>Peritoneal Cavity: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24166953</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/IAI.00721-13</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3911847&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Nuclear receptor Nur77 (NR4A1, TR3, or NGFI-B) has been shown to play an anti-inflammatory role in macrophages, which have a crucial function in defense against peritonitis. The function of Nur77 in Escherichia coli-induced peritoneal sepsis has not yet been investigated. Wild-type and Nur77-knockout mice were inoculated with E. coli, and bacterial outgrowth, cell recruitment, cytokine profiles, and tissue damage were investigated. We found only a minor transient decrease in bacterial loads in lung and liver of Nur77-knockout compared to wild-type mice at 14 h postinfection, yet no changes were found in the peritoneal lavage fluid or blood. No differences in inflammatory cytokine levels or neutrophil/macrophage numbers were observed, and bacterial loads were equal in wild-type and Nur77-knockout mice at 20 h postinfection in all body compartments tested. Also, isolated peritoneal macrophages did not show any differences in cytokine expression patterns in response to E. coli. In endothelial cells, Nur77 strongly downregulated both protein and mRNA expression of claudin-5, VE-cadherin, occludin, ZO-1, and β-catenin, and accordingly, these genes were upregulated in lungs of Nur77-deficient mice. Functional permeability tests pointed toward a strong role for Nur77 in endothelial barrier function. Indeed, tissue damage in E. coli-induced peritonitis was notably modulated by Nur77; liver necrosis and plasma aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) levels were lower in Nur77-knockout mice. These data suggest that Nur77 does not play a role in the host response to E. coli in the peritoneal and blood compartments. However, Nur77 does modulate bacterial influx into the organs via increased vascular permeability, thereby aggravating distant organ damage.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Mary Beth</author><author>Hunt, William R</author><author>Noe, Julie E</author><author>Rush, Natalia I</author><author>Schweitzer, Kelly S</author><author>Leece, Thomas C</author><author>Moldobaeva, Aigul</author><author>Wagner, Elizabeth M</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Poirier, Christophe</author><author>Presson, Robert G</author><author>Gulbins, Erich</author><author>Petrache, Irina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator impairs lung endothelial cell barrier function and increases susceptibility to microvascular damage from cigarette smoke.</title><secondary-title>Pulmonary circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonary circulation</full-title></periodical><pages>260-268</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25006445</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/675989</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4070785&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Abnormal lung microvascular endothelial vascular barrier function may contribute to pulmonary inflammation, such as that occurring during inhalation of cigarette smoke (CS). Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel expressed in both epithelial and endothelial cells, regulates the organization of tight junctions between epithelial cells and has also been implicated in the transport of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), a vascular barrier-enhancing sphingolipid. Because CS has been shown to affect CFTR function, we hypothesized that CFTR function contributes to lung endothelial cell barrier and that CFTR dysfunction worsens CS-induced injury. CFTR inhibitors GlyH-101 or CFTRinh172 caused a dose-dependent increase in pulmonary or bronchial endothelial monolayer permeability, which peaked after 4 hours. CFTR inhibition was associated with both intercellular gaps and actin stress fiber formation compared with vehicle-treated cells. Increasing endothelial S1P, either by exogenous treatment or by inhibition of its degradation, significantly improved the barrier function in CFTR-inhibited monolayers. Both cultured lung endothelia and the lung microcirculation visualized in vivo with intravital two-photon imaging of transgenic mice deficient in CFTR showed that CFTR dysfunction increased susceptibility to CS-induced permeability. These results suggested that CFTR function might be required for lung endothelial barrier, including adherence junction stability. Loss of CFTR function, especially concomitant to CS exposure, might promote lung inflammation by increasing endothelial cell permeability, which could be ameliorated by S1P.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wazir, Umar</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Wazir, Ali</author><author>Baig, Ruqia Mehmood</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Ster, Irina C</author><author>Sharma, Anup K</author><author>Mokbel, Kefah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of the knockdown of death-associated protein 1 expression on cell adhesion, growth and migration in breast cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Oncology reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology reports</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25530065</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/or.2014.3686</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25530065</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Death-associated protein 1 (DAP1) is a highly conserved phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of autophagy. A previous clinical study by our group suggested an association between low DAP1 expression and clinicopathological parameters of human breast cancer. In the present study, we aimed to determine the role of DAP1 in cancer cell behaviour in the context of human breast cancer. We developed knockdown sublines of MCF7 and MDA-MB‑231, and performed growth, adhesion and invasion assays and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) studies of the post-wound migration of cells. In addition, we studied the mRNA expression of caspase 8 and 9, DELE, IPS1, cyclin D1 and p21 in the control and knockdown sublines. Knockdown was associated with increased adhesion and migration, significantly so in the MDA-MB-231DAP1kd cell subline (p=0.029 and p=0.001, respectively). Growth in MCF7 cells showed a significant suppression on day 3 (p=0.029), followed by an increase in growth matching the controls on day 5. While no change in the apoptotic response to serum starvation could be attributed to DAP1 knockdown, the expression of known components of the apoptosis pathway (caspase 8) and cell cycle (p21) was significantly reduced in the MCF7DAP1kd cell subline (p≤0.05), while in MDA-MB-231DAP1kd the expression of a pro-apoptotic molecule, IPS1, was suppressed (p≤0.05). DAP1 may have an important role in cell adhesion, migration and growth in the context of breast cancer and has significant associations with the apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, we believe that delayed increase in growth observed in the MCF7DAP1kd cell subline may indicate activation of a strongly pro-oncogenic pathway downstream of DAP1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, J</author><author>Wan, J</author><author>Meng, J</author><author>Banerjee, S</author><author>Ramakrishnan, S</author><author>Roy, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Methamphetamine induces autophagy as a pro-survival response against apoptotic endothelial cell death through the Kappa opioid receptor.</title><secondary-title>Cell death &amp; disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell death &amp; disease</full-title></periodical><pages>e1099</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>abbreviations</keyword><keyword>autophagy</keyword><keyword>bbb</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>brain barrier</keyword><keyword>cell death</keyword><keyword>central nervous system</keyword><keyword>chain 3</keyword><keyword>cns</keyword><keyword>kappa opioid receptor</keyword><keyword>lc3</keyword><keyword>lc3-ii</keyword><keyword>methamphetamine</keyword><keyword>microtubule-associated protein 1</keyword><keyword>microtubule-associated protein 1 light</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24603327</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/cddis.2014.64</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3973232&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant with high abuse potential and severe neurotoxicity. Recent studies in animal models have indicated that METH can impair the blood-brain barrier (BBB), suggesting that some of the neurotoxic effects resulting from METH abuse could be due to barrier disruption. We report here that while chronic exposure to METH disrupts barrier function of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), an early pro-survival response is observed following acute exposure by induction of autophagic mechanisms. Acute METH exposure induces an early increase in Beclin1 and LC3 recruitment. This is mediated through inactivation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathway, and upregulation of the ERK1/2. Blockade of Kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and treatment with autophagic inhibitors accelerated METH-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the early autophagic response is a survival mechanism for endothelial cells and is mediated through the kappa opioid receptor. Our studies indicate that kappa opioid receptor can be therapeutically exploited for attenuating METH-induced BBB dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Susloparova, A</author><author>Koppenhöfer, D</author><author>Law, J K Y</author><author>Vu, X T</author><author>Ingebrandt, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing with field-effect transistors is able to unravel cellular adhesion and detachment processes on a single cell level.</title><secondary-title>Lab on a chip</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lab on a chip</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25412224</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c4lc00593g</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412224</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We introduce a novel technique of impedimetric sensing of cellular adhesion, which might have the potential to supplement the well-known technique of Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) in cell culture assays. In contrast to the already commercialized ECIS method, we are using ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) devices. The standard gold microelectrode size in ECIS is in the range of 100-250 μm in diameter. Reason for this limitation is that when downscaling the sensing electrodes, their effective impedance governed by the metal-liquid interface impedance is becoming very large and hence the currents to be measured are becoming very small reaching the limit of standard instrumentation. This is the main reason why typical assays with ECIS are focusing on applications like cell-cell junctions in confluent cultures. Single cell resolution is barely reachable with these systems. Here we use impedance spectroscopy with ISFET devices having gate dimensions of only 16 × 2 μm(2), which is enabling a real single cell resolution. We introduce an electrically equivalent circuit model, explain the measured effects upon single cell detachment, and present different cellular detachment scenarios. Our approach might supplement the field of ECIS with an alternative tool opening up a route for novel cell-substrate impedance sensing assays with so far unreachable lateral resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sung, J Y</author><author>Park, S-Y</author><author>Kim, J H</author><author>Kang, H G</author><author>Yoon, J H</author><author>Na, Y S</author><author>Kim, Y-N</author><author>Park, B-K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenomena, cell-motility, and invasion via TGF-β signaling in U2OS cells.</title><secondary-title>Cell death &amp; disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell death &amp; disease</full-title></periodical><pages>e1224</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Bone Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Shape</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interferon Regulatory Factors</keyword><keyword>Interferon Regulatory Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Interferon Regulatory Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Interferon-gamma</keyword><keyword>Interferon-gamma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma: genetics</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma: pathology</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Vimentin</keyword><keyword>Vimentin: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24832596</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/cddis.2014.189</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4047854&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription factor induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and a member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. ICSBP is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the immune response and cell growth and differentiation. However, little is known about its function in non-hematopoietic cells. Here we show a novel function for ICSBP in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenomena (ELP), cell motility, and invasion in human osteosarcoma cell lines, including U2OS cells. IFN-γ treatment induced ICSBP expression and EMT-like morphological change in U2OS cells, which were suppressed by ICSBP knockdown. To further investigate the role of ICSBP in ELP, we established a stable U2OS cell line that overexpresses ICSBP. ICSBP expression caused U2OS cells to have a more elongated shape and an increased vimentin and fibronectin expression. ICSBP expression also promoted adhesiveness, motility, and invasiveness of U2OS cells. ICSBP upregulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors and activated TGF-β signaling cascades, which were responsible for ELP as well as increased cell motility and invasion. In addition, ICSBP-induced TGF-β receptor activation resulted in the upregulation of Snail. Knockdown of Snail attenuated the ICSBP-induced augmentation of cell motility and invasion. Upregulation of Snail, ELP, and increased invasion by ICSBP expression were also observed in other osteosarcoma cell lines, such as Saos-2 and 143B. Furthermore, ICSBP and TGF-β receptor I were expressed in 45/54 (84%) and 47/54 (87%) of human osteosarcoma tissues, respectively, and showed significant correlation (r=0.47, P=0.0007) with respect to their expression levels. Taken altogether, these data demonstrate a novel function for ICSBP in ELP, cell motility, and invasion through the TGF-β and Snail signaling pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, Debanjan</author><author>Kamil, Farhan Ahmad</author><author>Agrawal, Snehil</author><author>Biswas, Karabi</author><author>Das, Soumen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fragmental Frequency Analysis Method to Estimate Electrical Cell Parameters From Bioimpedance Study</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</full-title></periodical><pages>1991-2000</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TIM.2014.2303553</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6739131</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper introduces an alternate approach utilizing the fragmental frequency analysis method for analyzing bioimpedance data to estimate electrical cell parameters. Impedance of cervical cancer cells (HeLa) in phosphate buffer saline media is measured using an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) device and impedance analyzer. The measured impedance data were visualized by modeling an equivalent electrical circuit of the system considering the dominancy of individual parameters of the ECIS system and analyzed in different frequency zones. The present approach eliminates the convergence inaccuracy in fitting the experimental impedance data with fitting software arising due to invalid initial conditions, and a large number of data points.

Permeation of solutes across the endothelial cell monolayer occurs either paracellularly through specialized endothelial cell-cell junctions or transcellularly via special transport mechanisms including transcytosis, via the formation of transcellular channels, or by cell membrane transport proteins. Several in vitro assays have been developed in the past few decades to analyze the molecular mechanisms of transendothelial permeability. Measurement of the electrical resistance of the cell monolayer has proven to be particularly suitable for analyzing paracellular barrier function with high-time resolution over long time periods. We review the various permeability assays and focus on the electrical impedance analysis of endothelial cell monolayers. We also address current progress in the development of techniques used to investigate endothelial permeability with high-lateral resolution and under mechanical loads.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Joshi, Atul D</author><author>Dimitropoulou, Christiana</author><author>Thangjam, Gagan</author><author>Snead, Connie</author><author>Feldman, Sara</author><author>Barabutis, Nektarios</author><author>Fulton, David</author><author>Hou, Yali</author><author>Kumar, Sanjiv</author><author>Patel, Vijay</author><author>Gorshkov, Boris</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Black, Stephen M</author><author>Catravas, John D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat shock protein 90 inhibitors prevent LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction by disrupting RhoA signaling.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>170-179</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzoquinones</keyword><keyword>Benzoquinones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins</keyword><keyword>HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins: antagonists &amp; inhibitor</keyword><keyword>HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Lactams</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Macrocyclic</keyword><keyword>Macrocyclic: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>23972231</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2012-0496OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23972231</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Permeability of the endothelial monolayer is increased when exposed to the bacterial endotoxin LPS. Our previous studies have shown that heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibitors protect and restore LPS-mediated hyperpermeability in bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of Hsp90 inhibition against LPS-mediated hyperpermeability in cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) and delineated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibition is critical in the early phase, to prevent LPS-mediated hyperpermeability, and also in the later phase, to restore LPS-mediated hyperpermeability in HLMVECs. Because RhoA is a well known mediator of endothelial hyperpermeability, we investigated the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on LPS-mediated RhoA signaling. RhoA nitration and activity were increased by LPS in HLMVECs and suppressed when pretreated with the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17 demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG). In addition, inhibition of Rho kinase, a downstream effector of RhoA, protected HLMVECs from LPS-mediated hyperpermeability and abolished LPS-induced myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, a target of Rho kinase. In agreement with these findings, 17-AAG or dominant-negative RhoA attenuated LPS-induced MLC phosphorylation. MLC phosphorylation induced by constitutively active RhoA was also suppressed by 17-AAG, suggesting a role for Hsp90 downstream of RhoA. Inhibition of Src family kinases also suppressed RhoA activity and MLC phosphorylation. Together, these data indicate that Hsp90 inhibition prevents and repairs LPS-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction by suppressing Src-mediated RhoA activity and signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stolwijk, Judith a.</author><author>Matrougui, Khalid</author><author>Renken, Christian W</author><author>Trebak, Mohamed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of GPCR-mediated changes in endothelial barrier function: overview and fundamental considerations for stable and reproducible measurements.</title><secondary-title>Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>2193-2218</pages><volume>467</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>barrier function</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>teer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25537398</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00424-014-1674-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25537398</url><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00424-014-1674-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function;Review</label><abstract>The past 20 years has seen significant growth in using impedance-based assays to understand the molecular underpinning of endothelial and epithelial barrier function in response to physiological agonists and pharmacological and toxicological compounds. Most studies on barrier function use G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists which couple to fast and transient changes in barrier properties. The power of impedance-based techniques such as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) resides in its ability to detect minute changes in cell layer integrity label-free and in real-time ranging from seconds to days. We provide a comprehensive overview of the biophysical principles, applications, and recent developments in impedance-based methodologies. Despite extensive application of impedance analysis in endothelial barrier research, little attention has been paid to data analysis and critical experimental variables, which are both essential for signal stability and reproducibility. We describe the rationale behind common ECIS data presentation and interpretation and illustrate practical guidelines to improve signal intensity by adapting technical parameters such as electrode layout, monitoring frequency, or parameter (resistance versus impedance magnitude). Moreover, we discuss the impact of experimental parameters, including cell source, liquid handling, and agonist preparation on signal intensity and kinetics. Our discussions are supported by experimental data obtained from human microvascular endothelial cells challenged with three GPCR agonists, thrombin, histamine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wen, Beryl</author><author>Combes, Valery</author><author>Bonhoure, Amandine</author><author>Weksler, Babette B</author><author>Couraud, Pierre-Olivier</author><author>Grau, Georges E R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endotoxin-induced monocytic microparticles have contrasting effects on endothelial inflammatory responses.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e91597</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24646764</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0091597</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3960107&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Septic shock is a severe disease state characterised by the body's life threatening response to infection. Complex interactions between endothelial cells and circulating monocytes are responsible for microvasculature dysfunction contributing to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Here, we intended to determine whether microparticles derived from activated monocytes contribute towards inflammatory processes and notably vascular permeability. We found that endotoxin stimulation of human monocytes enhances the release of microparticles of varying phenotypes and mRNA contents. Elevated numbers of LPS-induced monocytic microparticles (mMP) expressed CD54 and contained higher levels of transcripts for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8. Using a prothrombin time assay, a greater reduction in plasma coagulation time was observed with LPS-induced mMP than with non-stimulated mMP. Co-incubation of mMP with the human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 triggered their time-dependent uptake and significantly enhanced endothelial microparticle release. Unexpectedly, mMP also modified signalling pathways by diminishing pSrc (tyr416) expression and promoted endothelial monolayer tightness, as demonstrated by endothelial impedance and permeability assays. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that LPS-induced mMP have contrasting effects on the intercellular communication network and display a dual potential: enhanced pro-inflammatory and procoagulant properties, together with protective function of the endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhuge, Yan</author><author>Yuan, Yang</author><author>van Breemen, Richard</author><author>Degrand, Michael</author><author>Holian, Oksana</author><author>Yoder, Mark</author><author>Lum, Hazel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stimulated bronchial epithelial cells release bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1.</title><secondary-title>Allergy, asthma &amp; immunology research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Allergy, asthma &amp; immunology research</full-title></periodical><pages>66-74</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24404396</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4168/aair.2014.6.1.66</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3881404&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PURPOSE: In human subjects and animal models with acute and chronic lung injury, the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is elevated in lung lining fluids. The increased LPC can promote an inflammatory microenvironment resulting in lung injury. Furthermore, pathological lung conditions are associated with upregulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the predominant enzyme producing LPC in tissues by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. However, the lung cell populations responsible for increases of LPC have yet to be systematically characterized. The goal was to investigate the LPC generation by bronchial epithelial cells in response to pathological mediators and determine the major LPC species produced. METHODS: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were challenged by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 1 or 6 h, and condition medium and cells collected for quantification of predominant LPC species by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PLA2. The direct effects of LPC in inducing inflammatory activities on NHBE were assessed by transepithelial resistance as well as expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). RESULTS: VEGF stimulation of NHBE for 1 or 6 h, significantly increased concentrations of LPC16:0, LPC18:0, and LPC18:1 in condition medium compared to control. The sPLA2-selective inhibitor (oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) inhibited the VEGF-induced release of LPC16:0 and LPC18:1 and PLA2 activity. In contrast, NHBE stimulated with TNF did not induce LPC release. VEGF did not increase mRNA of PLA2 subtypes sPLA2-X, sPLA2-XIIa, cPLA2-IVa, and iPLA2-VI. Exogenous LPC treatment increased expression of IL-8 and MMP-1, and reduced the transepithelial resistance in NHBE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that VEGF-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells are a key source of extracellular LPCs, which can function as an autocrine mediator with potential to induce airway epithelial inflammatory injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Monica Y</author><author>Skoura, Athanasia</author><author>Park, Eonjoo</author><author>Landskroner-Eiger, Shira</author><author>Jozsef, Levente</author><author>Luciano, Amelia K</author><author>Murata, Takahisa</author><author>Pasula, Satish</author><author>Dong, Yunzhou</author><author>Bouaouina, Mohamed</author><author>Calderwood, David a</author><author>Ferguson, Shawn M</author><author>De Camilli, Pietro</author><author>Sessa, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamin 2 regulation of integrin endocytosis, but not VEGF signaling, is crucial for developmental angiogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><issue>October 2013</issue><keywords><keyword>2012</keyword><keyword>angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>dnm</keyword><keyword>dnm1</keyword><keyword>dnm2</keyword><keyword>dynamin</keyword><keyword>endocytosis</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>ferguson and de camilli</keyword><keyword>for membrane fission leading</keyword><keyword>is a gtpase essential</keyword><keyword>mouse</keyword><keyword>of dnm in mammalian</keyword><keyword>there are three isoforms</keyword><keyword>to clathrin-mediated endocytosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24598168</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/dev.104539</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598168</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Here we show that dynamin 2 (Dnm2) is essential for angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In cultured endothelial cells lacking Dnm2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and receptor levels are augmented whereas cell migration and morphogenesis are impaired. Mechanistically, the loss of Dnm2 increases focal adhesion size and the surface levels of multiple integrins and reduces the activation state of β1 integrin. In vivo, the constitutive or inducible loss of Dnm2 in endothelium impairs branching morphogenesis and promotes the accumulation of β1 integrin at sites of failed angiogenic sprouting. Collectively, our data show that Dnm2 uncouples VEGF signaling from function and coordinates the endocytic turnover of integrins in a manner that is crucially important for angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Haibo</author><author>Jiang, Yanchao</author><author>Shi, Dallas</author><author>Quilliam, Lawrence A</author><author>Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, Magdalena</author><author>Wittchen, Erika S</author><author>Li, Dean Y</author><author>Hartnett, M Elizabeth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activation of Rap1 inhibits NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS generation in retinal pigment epithelium and reduces choroidal neovascularization.</title><secondary-title>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>265-274</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Choroidal Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Choroidal Neovascularization: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Oxidation-Reduction</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24043260</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.13-240028</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043260</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Activation of Rap1 GTPase can improve the integrity of the barrier of the retina pigment epithelium (RPE) and reduce choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation also reduces CNV. We hypothesize that Rap1 inhibits NADPH oxidase-generated ROS and thereby reduces CNV formation. Using a murine model of laser-induced CNV, we determined that reduced Rap1 activity in RPE/choroid occurred with CNV formation and that activation of Rap1 by 2'-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT)-reduced laser-induced CNV via inhibiting NADPH oxidase-generated ROS. In RPE, inhibition of Rap1 by Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP) increased ROS generation, whereas activation of Rap1 by 8CPT reduced ROS by interfering with the assembly of NADPH oxidase membrane subunit p22phox with NOX4 or cytoplasmic subunit p47phox. Activation of NADPH oxidase with Rap1GAP reduced RPE barrier integrity via cadherin phosphorylation and facilitated choroidal EC migration across the RPE monolayer. Rap1GAP-induced ROS generation was inhibited by active Rap1a, but not Rap1b, and activation of Rap1a by 8CPT in Rap1b(-/-) mice reduced laser-induced CNV, in correlation with decreased ROS generation in RPE/choroid. These findings provide evidence that active Rap1 reduces CNV by interfering with the assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits and increasing the integrity of the RPE barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kalwa, Hermann</author><author>Sartoretto, Juliano L</author><author>Martinelli, Roberta</author><author>Romero, Natalia</author><author>Steinhorn, Benjamin S</author><author>Tao, Ming</author><author>Ozaki, C Keith</author><author>Carman, Christopher V</author><author>Michel, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Central role for hydrogen peroxide in P2Y1 ADP receptor-mediated cellular responses in vascular endothelium.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>3383-3388</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunoblotting</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Purinergic P2Y1</keyword><keyword>Purinergic P2Y1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24550450</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1320854111</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3948230&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>ADP activates a family of cell surface receptors that modulate signaling pathways in a broad range of cells. ADP receptor antagonists are widely used to treat cardiovascular disease states. These studies identify a critical role for the stable reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mediating cellular responses activated by the G protein-coupled P2Y1 receptor for ADP. We found that ADP-dependent phosphorylation of key endothelial signaling proteins--including endothelial nitric oxide synthase, AMP-activated protein kinase, and the actin-binding MARCKS protein--was blocked by preincubation with PEG-catalase, which degrades H2O2. ADP treatment promoted the H2O2-dependent phosphorylation of c-Abl, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that modulates the actin cytoskeleton. Cellular imaging experiments using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors revealed that ADP-stimulated activation of the cytoskeleton-associated small GTPase Rac1 was independent of H2O2. However, Rac1-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-(4, 5)-bisphosphate, and the c-Abl-interacting protein CrkII are mediated by H2O2. We transfected endothelial cells with differentially targeted HyPer2 H2O2 biosensors and found that ADP promoted a marked increase in H2O2 levels in the cytosol and caveolae, and a smaller increase in mitochondria. We performed a screen for P2Y1 receptor-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation and discovered that ADP transactivates Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in these cells. Our observation that P2Y1 receptor-mediated responses involve Flt3 transactivation may identify a unique mechanism whereby cancer chemotherapy with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors promotes vascular dysfunction. Taken together, these findings establish a critical role for endogenous H2O2 in control of ADP-mediated signaling responses in the vascular wall.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lai, Yi-Ting</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing in vitro cytotoxicity of cell micromotion by Hilbert-Huang Transform</title><secondary-title>2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</full-title></periodical><pages>3200-3203</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-7929-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944303</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6944303</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a powerful instrument for quantifying cell behavior in tissue culture. As cells attach and spread on the sensing electrode, they restrict the current flow and hence cause the increase of electrical impedance. Furthermore, cell motion may reveal itself as electrical fluctuations, which are always associated with living cells and continue even when the cells become fully confluent. The impedance fluctuation is attributed to incessant changes in the size of the cell-substrate space as cells persistently rearrange their cell-substrate adhesion sites. The magnitude of this sort of vertical motion detected by ECIS is of the order of nanometers and referred to as micromotion. In this study, Hilbert-Huang Transform was used as a micromotion analysis tool to distinguish the in vitro cytotoxicity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to low levels of cytochalasin B. Hilbert-Huang Transform consists of two procedures: the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert Transform. The measured impedance fluctuations due to cell micromotion were decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD, and then these IMFs were transferred to instantaneous frequencies by Hilbert Transform. Both amplitude and phase of instantaneous frequencies were expressed as a time-frequency spectrum, called Hilbert spectrum, which displayed different distribution pattern in response to different cytochalasin B concentration. The total instantaneous energy (IE) of each IMF was also calculated to quantify the spectral difference. In addition to the observation of a dose-dependent relationship, the IE value of the first IMF at 0.1 μM decreased to about 48% of the control value and significantly distinguished the cytotoxic effect of 0.1 μM of cytochalasin B (P&lt;;0.05).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, James E</author><author>Patel, Niketa A</author><author>Carter, Gay</author><author>Moor, Andrea</author><author>Patel, Rekha</author><author>Ghansah, Tomar</author><author>Mathur, Abhishek</author><author>Murr, Michel M</author><author>Bickford, Paula</author><author>Gould, Lisa J</author><author>Cooper, Denise R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of Markers and Functional Attributes of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells and Dedifferentiated Adipocyte Cells from Subcutaneous Fat of an Obese Diabetic Donor.</title><secondary-title>Advances in wound care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in wound care</full-title></periodical><pages>219-228</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24669358</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/wound.2013.0452</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3955970&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: Adipose tissue is a robust source of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) that may be able to provide secreted factors that promote the ability of wounded tissue to heal. However, adipocytes also have the potential to dedifferentiate in culture to cells with stem cell-like properties that may improve their behavior and functionality for certain applications. Approach: ADSCs are adult mesenchymal stem cells that are cultured from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue. However, adipocytes are capable of dedifferentiating into cells with stem cell properties. In this case study, we compare ADSC and dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells from the same patient and fat depot for mesenchymal cell markers, embryonic stem cell markers, ability to differentiate to adipocytes and osteoblasts, senescence and telomerase levels, and ability of conditioned media (CM) to stimulate migration of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Innovation and Conclusions: ADSCs and DFAT cells displayed identical levels of CD90, CD44, CD105, and were CD34- and CD45-negative. They also expressed similar levels of Oct4, BMI1, KLF4, and SALL4. DFAT cells, however, showed higher efficiency in adipogenic and osteogenic capacity. Telomerase levels of DFAT cells were double those of ADSCs, and senescence declined in DFAT cells. CM from both cell types altered the migration of fibroblasts. Despite reports of ADSCs from a number of human depots, there have been no comparisons of the ability of dedifferentiated DFAT cells from the same donor and depot to differentiate or modulate migration of HDFs. Since ADSCs were from an obese diabetic donor, reprogramming of DFAT cells may help improve a patient's cells for regenerative medicine applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schorch, Björn</author><author>Song, Shuo</author><author>van Diemen, Ferdy R</author><author>Bock, Hans H</author><author>May, Petra</author><author>Herz, Joachim</author><author>Brummelkamp, Thijn R</author><author>Papatheodorou, Panagiotis</author><author>Aktories, Klaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LRP1 is a receptor for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin indicating a two-receptor model of clostridial glycosylating toxins.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>6431-6436</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Clostridium perfringens</keyword><keyword>Clostridium perfringens: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Embryo</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Glycosylation</keyword><keyword>Haploidy</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1</keyword><keyword>Mammalian</keyword><keyword>Mammalian: cytology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure</keyword><keyword>Tertiary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24737893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1323790111</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4035940&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Large glycosylating toxins are major virulence factors of various species of pathogenic Clostridia. Prototypes are Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, which cause antibiotics-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. The current model of the toxins' action suggests that receptor binding is mediated by a C-terminal domain of combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROP). This model is challenged by the glycosylating Clostridium perfringens large cytotoxin (TpeL toxin) that is devoid of the CROP domain but still intoxicates cells. Using a haploid genetic screen, we identified LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a host cell receptor for the TpeL toxin. LRP1-deficient cells are not able to take up TpeL and are not intoxicated. Expression of cluster IV of LRP1 is sufficient to rescue toxin uptake in these cells. By plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a KD value of 23 nM was determined for binding of TpeL to LRP1 cluster IV. The C terminus of TpeL (residues 1335-1779) represents the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the toxin. RBD-like regions are conserved in all other clostridial glycosylating toxins preceding their CROP domain. CROP-deficient C. difficile toxin B is toxic to cells, depending on the RBD-like region (residues 1349-1811) but does not interact with LRP1. Our data indicate the presence of a second, CROP-independent receptor-binding domain in clostridial glycosylating toxins and suggest a two-receptor model for the cellular uptake of clostridial glycosylating toxins.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huertas, G</author><author>Maldonado, A</author><author>Yufera, A</author><author>Rueda, A</author><author>Huertas, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Circuit for Cell-Culture Assays</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>PP</volume><issue>99</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TCSII.2014.2386233</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6998822</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A system for cell-culture real-time monitoring using an Oscillation-Based (OB) approach is proposed.

The underlying mechanism of the lung manifestations in BHD is unclear. We show that BHD lungs exhibit increased alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and that Flcn deletion in mouse lung epithelium leads to cell apoptosis, alveolar enlargement, and an impairment of both epithelial barrier and overall lung function. We find that Flcn-null epithelial cell apoptosis is the result of impaired AMPK activation and increased cleaved caspase-3. AMPK activator LKB1 and E-cadherin are downregulated by Flcn loss and restored by its expression. Correspondingly, Flcn-null cell survival is rescued by the AMPK activator AICAR or constitutively active AMPK. AICAR also improves lung condition of Flcn(f/f):SP-C-Cre mice. Our data suggest that lung cysts in BHD may result from an underlying defect in alveolar epithelial cell survival, attributable to FLCN regulation of the E-cadherin-LKB1-AMPK axis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kosaraju, K</author><author>Tarannum, M</author><author>Crawford, S</author><author>Garde, K</author><author>Aravamudhan, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining the Cellular Uptake and Toxicity of Engineered Nanomaterials</title><secondary-title>ECS Transactions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECS Transactions</full-title></periodical><pages>15-21</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>36</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1149/06136.0015ecst</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ecst.ecsdl.org/cgi/doi/10.1149/06136.0015ecst</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Engineered Nanomaterials (ENs) such as silica, ceria and alumina nanoparticles have been extensively used in health care, energy and electronics.

First, comprehensive characterization using DLS, zeta potential, BET, XRD, FTIR, Raman, SEM and TEM was done. Then, cell exposure studies were carried out on A549 lung epithetical cells to study cell viability and membrane integrity. Lastly, cellular uptake of ENs was studied by using techniques such as Confocal Raman Spectroscopy and ICP-OES and Electrochemical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS). ICP-OES analysis showed uptake of silica, ceria and alumina, while Confocal Raman indicated the uptake of Ceria ENs.

We previously demonstrated that CFTR-silenced airway cells migrate more slowly during wound repair than CFTR-expressing controls. In addition, CFTR-deficient cells and mouse models have been reported to have altered sphingolipid levels. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that reduced migration in CFTR-deficient airway epithelial cells results from altered sphingolipid composition. We used cell lines derived from a human airway epithelial cell line (Calu-3) stably transfected with CFTR short hairpin RNA (CFTR-silenced) or nontargeting short hairpin RNA (controls). Cell migration was measured by electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Lipid analyses, addition of exogenous glycosphingolipids, and immunoblotting were performed. We found that levels of the glycosphingolipid, GM1 ganglioside, were ~60% lower in CFTR-silenced cells than in controls. CFTR-silenced cells exhibited reduced levels of activated β1-integrin, phosphorylated tyrosine 576 of focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), and phosphorylation of Crk-associated substrate (pCAS). Addition of GM1 (but not GM3) ganglioside to CFTR-silenced cells restored activated β1-integrin, pFAK, and pCAS to near control levels and partially restored (~40%) cell migration. Our results suggest that decreased GM1 in CFTR-silenced cells depresses β1-integrin signaling, which contributes to the delayed wound repair observed in these cells. These findings have implications for the pathology of cystic fibrosis, where altered sphingolipid levels in airway epithelial cells could result in a diminished capacity for wound repair after injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Hooren, Kathinka W E M</author><author>Spijkers, Léon J A</author><author>van Breevoort, Dorothee</author><author>Fernandez-Borja, Mar</author><author>Bierings, Ruben</author><author>van Buul, Jaap D</author><author>Alewijnse, Astrid E</author><author>Peters, Stephan L M</author><author>Voorberg, Jan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 mediates sphingosine-1-phosphate induced release of weibel-palade bodies from endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e91346</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24632890</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0091346</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3954688&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an agonist for five distinct G-protein coupled receptors, that is released by platelets, mast cells, erythrocytes and endothelial cells. S1P promotes endothelial cell barrier function and induces release of endothelial cell-specific storage-organelles designated Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). S1P-mediated enhancement of endothelial cell barrier function is dependent on S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) mediated signaling events that result in the activation of the small GTPase Rac1. Recently, we have reported that Rac1 regulates epinephrine-induced WPB exocytosis following its activation by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 1 (PREX1). S1P has also been described to induce WPB exocytosis. Here, we confirm that S1P induces release of WPBs using von Willebrand factor (VWF) as a marker. Using siRNA mediated knockdown of gene expression we show that S1PR1 is not involved in S1P-mediated release of WPBs. In contrast depletion of the S1PR3 greatly reduced S1P-induced release of VWF. S1P-mediated enhancement of endothelial barrier function was not affected by S1PR3-depletion whereas it was greatly impaired in cells lacking S1PR1. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 completely abrogated S1P-mediated release of VWF. Also, the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM significantly reduced S1P-induced release of VWF. Our findings indicate that S1P-induced release of haemostatic, inflammatory and angiogenic components stored within WPBs depends on the S1PR3.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ameri, Hossein</author><author>Liu, Hua</author><author>Liu, Rong</author><author>Ha, Yonju</author><author>Paulucci-Holthauzen, Adriana A</author><author>Hu, Shuqun</author><author>Motamedi, Massoud</author><author>Godley, Bernard F</author><author>Tilton, Ronald G</author><author>Zhang, Wenbo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TWEAK/Fn14 pathway is a novel mediator of retinal neovascularization.</title><secondary-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</full-title></periodical><pages>801-813</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Indirect</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Regulatory Sequences</keyword><keyword>Retinal Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Retinal Neovascularization: genetics</keyword><keyword>Retinal Neovascularization: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Retinal Neovascularization: pathology</keyword><keyword>Retinal Neovascularization: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels: pathology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor: genetics</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factors</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factors: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>alpha Subunit</keyword><keyword>alpha Subunit: genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24408972</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.13-12812</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3920863&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>PURPOSE: Retinal neovascularization (NV) is a major cause of vision loss in ischemia-induced retinopathy. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor inducible-14 (Fn14), have been implicated in angiogenesis, but their role in retinal diseases is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in retinal NV. METHODS: Studies were performed in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and in primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Hyperoxia treatment was initiated on postnatal day (P)14. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to assess retinal vascular changes in relation to expression of Fn14 and TWEAK. RESULTS: Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 mRNA was prominently increased from P13 to P17 in OIR retinas, whereas TWEAK level was slightly decreased. These alterations were normalized by hyperoxia treatment and were more striking in isolated retinal vessels. There was a discernible shift in the immunoreactivity of Fn14 and TWEAK from the neuronal layers in the healthy retina to the neovascular tufts in that of OIR. Blockade of TWEAK/Fn14 significantly prevented retinal NV while slightly accelerated revascularization. In contrast, activation of Fn14 positively regulated survival pathways in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) family and robustly enhanced HRMEC survival. Furthermore, gene analysis revealed the regulatory region of Fn14 gene contains several conserved hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α binding sites. Overexpression of HIF-1α prominently induced Fn14 expression in HRMECs. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/fibroblast growth factor inducible-14 (Fn14) pathway is involved in the development of pathologic retinal neovascularization. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α is likely implicated in the upregulation of Fn14.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowe, Rachael A</author><author>Cox, Orla T</author><author>Ayllón, Verónica</author><author>Tresse, Emilie</author><author>Healy, Nollaig C</author><author>Edmunds, Shelley J</author><author>Huigsloot, Merei</author><author>O'Connor, Rosemary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PDLIM2 regulates transcription factor activity in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the COP9 signalosome.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><pages>184-195</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Polarity</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins: met</keyword><keyword>LIM Domain Proteins</keyword><keyword>LIM Domain Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>MCF-7 Cells</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Multiprotein Complexes</keyword><keyword>Multiprotein Complexes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peptide Hydrolases</keyword><keyword>Peptide Hydrolases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24196835</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E13-06-0306</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3873889&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epithelial cell differentiation and polarized migration associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer requires integration of gene expression with cytoskeletal dynamics. Here we show that the PDZ-LIM domain protein PDLIM2 (Mystique/SLIM), a known cytoskeletal protein and promoter of nuclear nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) degradation, regulates transcription factor activity and gene expression through the COP9 signalosome (CSN). Although repressed in certain cancers, PDLIM2 is highly expressed in invasive cancer cells. Here we show that PDLIM2 suppression causes loss of directional migration, inability to polarize the cytoskeleton, and reversal of the EMT phenotype. This is accompanied by altered activity of several transcription factor families, including β-catenin, Ap-1, NFκB, interferon regulatory factors, STATs, JUN, and p53. We also show that PDLIM2 associates with CSN5, and cells with suppressed PDLIM2 exhibit reduced nuclear accumulation and deneddylation activity of the CSN toward the cullin 1 and cullin 3 subunits of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Thus PDLIM2 integrates cytoskeleton signaling with gene expression in epithelial differentiation by controlling the stability of key transcription factors and CSN activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Widder, Mark W</author><author>Brennan, Linda M</author><author>Hanft, Elizabeth A</author><author>Schrock, Mary E</author><author>James, Ryan R</author><author>van der Schalie, William H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation and refinement of a field-portable drinking water toxicity sensor utilizing electric cell-substrate impedance sensing and a fluidic biochip.</title><secondary-title>Journal of applied toxicology : JAT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of applied toxicology : JAT</full-title></periodical><pages>701-708</pages><issue>January 2014</issue><keywords><keyword>10.1002/jat.3017 and impedance</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>RTgill-W1</keyword><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>fl uidic biochip</keyword><keyword>fluidic biochip</keyword><keyword>impedance</keyword><keyword>in vitro toxicology</keyword><keyword>rainbow trout gill epithelial</keyword><keyword>rainbow trout gill epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>rtgill-w1</keyword><keyword>toxicity sensor</keyword><keyword>water toxicity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25231170</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jat.3017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231170</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The US Army's need for a reliable and field-portable drinking water toxicity sensor was the catalyst for the development and evaluation of an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) device. Water testing technologies currently available to soldiers in the field are analyte-specific and have limited capabilities to detect broad-based water toxicity. The ECIS sensor described here uses rainbow trout gill epithelial cells seeded on fluidic biochips to measure changes in impedance for the detection of possible chemical contamination of drinking water supplies. Chemicals selected for testing were chosen as representatives of a broad spectrum of toxic industrial compounds. Results of a US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-sponsored evaluation of the field portable device were similar to previously published US Army testing results of a laboratory-based version of the same technology. Twelve of the 18 chemicals tested following USEPA Technology Testing and Evaluation Program procedures were detected by the ECIS sensor within 1 h at USEPA-derived human lethal concentrations. To simplify field-testing methods further, elimination of a procedural step that acclimated cells to serum-free media streamlined the test process with only a slight loss of chemical sensitivity. For field use, the ECIS sensor will be used in conjunction with an enzyme-based sensor that is responsive to carbamate and organophosphorus pesticides.

Here, we report our observations of the effect of knocking down SOCS7 gene on the behaviour of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate whether this involves HGF/C-MET pathway using the PLCγ-1 blocker U73122. METHODS: MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were transfected with anti-SOCS7 ribozymal transgene, to create sublines with SOCS7 knockdown. The in vitro growth and migration of the cells were evaluated in basic conditions and with HGF and U73122 treatment using growth assays, scratch-wound, and electrical cell impedance sensing (ECIS) migration assays. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 in vivo tumour xenograft growth were also studied. RESULTS: Basal in vitro growth and migration of both cellular lines and the in vivo MCF7 xenograft growth were significantly enhanced with SOCS7 knockdown. In vitro HGF treatment has further influenced the growth and migration when SOCS7 gene was knocked-down in both cellular lines (P &lt; 0.05). PLCγ-1 pharmacological inhibition of the HGF/C-MET cascade during their in vitro growth and migration seemed to only occur when SOCS7 gene was knocked down. CONCLUSIONS: We report a unique regulatory role for SOCS7 in controlling the malignant behaviour of breast cancer lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 in vitro and the MCF7 tumour xenografts in vivo. We also report a regulatory role for SOCS7 during the in vitro HGF-induced growth and migration in these cells as HGF treatment and SOCS7 loss have synergistically enhanced these functions. This SOCS7 knockdown-attributed effect could be due to a precise anti-PLCγ-1 role.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Banerjee, Sulagna</author><author>Nomura, Alice</author><author>Sangwan, Veena</author><author>Chugh, Rohit</author><author>Dudeja, Vikas</author><author>Vickers, Selwyn M</author><author>Saluja, Ashok</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CD133+ Tumor Initiating Cells in a Syngenic Murine Model of Pancreatic Cancer Respond to Minnelide</title><secondary-title>Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>2388-2399</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>AACR</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2947</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2947</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laroui, Hamed</author><author>Geem, Duke</author><author>Xiao, Bo</author><author>Viennois, Emilie</author><author>Rakhya, Poonam</author><author>Denning, Timothy</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeting intestinal inflammation with CD98 siRNA/PEI-loaded nanoparticles.</title><secondary-title>Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>69-80</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD98</keyword><keyword>CD98: chemistry</keyword><keyword>CD98: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Colon</keyword><keyword>Colon: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Colon: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Colon: pathology</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dextran Sulfate</keyword><keyword>Dextran Sulfate: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Transfer Techniques</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: pathology</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: pathology</keyword><keyword>Intestines</keyword><keyword>Intestines: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Intestines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestines: pathology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Polyethyleneimine</keyword><keyword>Polyethyleneimine: chemistry</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24025751</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/mt.2013.214</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24025751</url></web-urls></urls><label>Inflammation</label><abstract>Intestinal CD98 expression plays a crucial role in controlling homeostatic and innate immune responses in the gut. Modulation of CD98 expression in intestinal cells therefore represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Here, the advantages of nanoparticles (NPs) are used, including their ability to easily pass through physiological barriers and evade phagocytosis, high loading concentration, rapid kinetics of mixing and resistance to degradation. Using physical chemistry characterizations techniques, CD98 siRNA/polyethyleneimine (PEI)-loaded NPs was characterized (diameter of ~480 nm and a zeta potential of -5.26 mV). Interestingly, CD98 siRNA can be electrostatically complexed by PEI and thus protected from RNase. In addition, CD98 siRNA/PEI-loaded NPs are nontoxic and biocompatible with intestinal cells. Oral administration of CD98/PEI-loaded NPs encapsulated in a hydrogel reduced CD98 expression in mouse colonic tissues and decreased dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in a mouse model. Finally, flow cytometry showed that CD98 was effectively downregulated in the intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal macrophages of treated mice. Finally, the results collectively demonstrated the therapeutic effect of &quot;hierarchical nano-micro particles&quot; with colon-homing capabilities and the ability to directly release &quot;molecularly specific&quot; CD98 siRNA in colonic cells, thereby decreasing colitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goc, Anna</author><author>Al-Husein, Belal</author><author>Katsanevas, Katerina</author><author>Steinbach, Alison</author><author>Lou, Uvette</author><author>Sabbineni, Harika</author><author>Deremer, David L</author><author>Somanath, Payaningal R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeting Src-mediated Tyr216 phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3 in prostate cancer cells inhibit prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo</title><secondary-title>Oncotarget</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncotarget</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>GSK-3</keyword><keyword>Src</keyword><keyword>Tyr-216</keyword><keyword>dasatinib</keyword><keyword>prostate cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget%5Cnwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>Recent studies suggest a positive correlation between glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation and tumor growth. Currently, it is unclear how both Akt that inhibits GSK-3 and active GSK-3 are maintained concurrently in tumor cells. We investigated the role of GSK-3 and the existence of an Akt-resistant pathway for GSK-3 activation in prostate cancer cells. Our data show that Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase is responsible for Y216 GSK-3 phosphorylation leading to its activation even when Akt is active. Experiments involving mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking cSrc, Yes and Fyn, as well as Src activity modulation in prostate cancer cells with constitutively active (CA-Src) and dominant negative Src (DN-Src) plasmids demonstrated the integral role of Src in Y216 GSK-3 phosphorylation and activity modulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 with SB415286 in PC3 cells resulted in impaired motility, proliferation and colony formation. Treatment of PC3 cells with the Src inhibitor dasatinib reduced Y216 GSK-3 phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation, invasion and micrometastasis in vitro. Dasatinib treatment of athymic nude mice resulted in impaired growth of PC3 cell tumor xenograft. Together, we provide novel insight into the Src-mediated Y216 GSK-3 phosphorylation and activation in prostate cancer cells and reveal the potential benefits of targeting Src-GSK-3 axis using drugs such as dasatinib.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horimoto, Naoya</author><author>Kitamura, Shinji</author><author>Tsuji, Kenji</author><author>Makino, Hirofumi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mizoribine inhibits the proliferation of renal stem/progenitor cells by G1/S arrest during renal regeneration.</title><secondary-title>Acta medica Okayama</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta medica Okayama</full-title></periodical><pages>7-15</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Checkpoints</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Checkpoints: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>G1 Phase</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents</keyword><keyword>Immunosuppressive Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney: cytology</keyword><keyword>Kidney: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Kidney: physiology</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Regeneration</keyword><keyword>Regeneration: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Ribonucleosides</keyword><keyword>Ribonucleosides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>S Phase</keyword><keyword>Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Stem Cells</keyword><keyword>Stem Cells: drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24553483</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553483</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Immunosuppressive agents are generally administered to treat kidney diseases. However, it is unclear whether renal stem/progenitor cells are directly affected by the immunosuppressive agents. We used normal rat kidney cells, ureteric bud cells and rat kidney stem/progenitor cells in this study. Mizoribine (MZR), cyclophosphamide (CPA) and cyclosporine (CyA) were added to the culture media of these cells. We evaluated the effects of these immunosuppressive agents on cell proliferation using an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS) and their effects on the process of renal regeneration using the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury rat model. The ECIS data showed that proliferation of each of the 3 types of cells was significantly suppressed by MZR. MZR treatment enhanced renal tubular injury in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injured rats, and significantly decreased levels of M-phase cells and Nestin-positive cells. These results suggested that MZR inhibits the cell cycle of renal stem/progenitor cells;thus, physicians should take note that MZR might affect not only inflammation but also renal regeneration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Astanina, Ksenia</author><author>Simon, Yvette</author><author>Cavelius, Christian</author><author>Petry, Sandra</author><author>Kraegeloh, Annette</author><author>Kiemer, Alexandra K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles impair endothelial integrity and inhibit nitric oxide production.</title><secondary-title>Acta biomaterialia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta biomaterialia</full-title></periodical><pages>4896-4911</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25123083</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.actbio.2014.07.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25123083</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) are widely used both clinically and experimentally for diverse in vivo applications, such as contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, hyperthermia and drug delivery. Biomedical applications require particles to have defined physical and chemical properties, and to be stable in biological media. Despite a suggested low cytotoxic action, adverse reactions of SPION in concentrations relevant for biomedical use have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. In the present work we employed Endorem®, dextran-stabilized SPION approved as an intravenous contrast agent, and compared its action to a set of other nanoparticles with potential for magnetic resonance imaging applications. SPION in concentrations relevant for in vivo applications were rapidly taken up by endothelial cells and exhibited no direct cytotoxicity. Electric cell impedance sensing measurements demonstrated that SPION, but not BaSO4/Gd nanoparticles, impaired endothelial integrity, as was confirmed by increased intercellular gap formation in endothelial monolayers. These structural changes induced the subcellular translocation and inhibition of the cytoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic enzyme endothelial NO-synthase and reduced NO production. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory NO production of macrophages was not affected by SPION. In conclusion, our data suggest that SPION might substantially alter endothelial integrity and function at therapeutically relevant doses, which are not cytotoxic.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hudson, Natalie</author><author>Powner, Michael B</author><author>Sarker, Mosharraf H</author><author>Burgoyne, Thomas</author><author>Campbell, Matthew</author><author>Ockrim, Zoe K</author><author>Martinelli, Roberta</author><author>Futter, Clare E</author><author>Grant, Maria B</author><author>Fraser, Paul A</author><author>Shima, David T</author><author>Greenwood, John</author><author>Turowski, Patric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential apicobasal VEGF signaling at vascular blood-neural barriers.</title><secondary-title>Developmental cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental cell</full-title></periodical><pages>541-552</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Inbred Lew</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Neurons</keyword><keyword>Neurons: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1: met</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2: met</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Wistar</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25175707</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.devcel.2014.06.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4160345&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The vascular endothelium operates in a highly polarized environment, but to date there has been little exploration of apicobasal polarization of its signaling. We show that VEGF-A, histamine, IGFBP3, and LPA trigger unequal endothelial responses when acting from the circulation or the parenchymal side at blood-neural barriers. For VEGF-A, highly polarized receptor distribution contributed to distinct signaling patterns: VEGFR2, which was found to be predominantly abluminal, mediated increased permeability via p38; in contrast, luminal VEGFR1 led to Akt activation and facilitated cytoprotection. Importantly, such differential apicobasal signaling and VEGFR distribution were found in the microvasculature of brain and retina but not lung, indicating that endothelial cells at blood-neural barriers possess specialized signaling compartments that assign different functions depending on whether an agonist is tissue or blood borne.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Banki, Eszter</author><author>Sosnowska, Danuta</author><author>Tucsek, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Gautam, Tripti</author><author>Toth, Peter</author><author>Tarantini, Stefano</author><author>Tamas, Andrea</author><author>Helyes, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Reglodi, Dora</author><author>Sonntag, William E</author><author>Csiszar, Anna</author><author>Ungvari, Zoltan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age-Related Decline of Autocrine Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide Impairs Angiogenic Capacity of Rat Cerebromicrovascular Endothelial Cells.</title><secondary-title>The journals of gerontology.

PACAP is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide secreted by endothelial cells and neurons, which confers important antiaging effects. To test the hypothesis that age-related changes in autocrine PACAP signaling contributes to dysregulation of endothelial angiogenic capacity, primary CMVECs were isolated from 3-month-old (young) and 24-month-old (aged) Fischer 344 x Brown Norway rats. In aged CMVECs, expression of PACAP was decreased, which was associated with impaired capacity to form capillary-like structures, impaired adhesiveness to collagen (assessed using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing [ECIS] technology), and increased apoptosis (caspase3 activity) when compared with young cells. Overexpression of PACAP in aged CMVECs resulted in increased formation of capillary-like structures, whereas it did not affect cell adhesion. Treatment with recombinant PACAP also significantly increased endothelial tube formation and inhibited apoptosis in aged CMVECs. In young CMVECs shRNA knockdown of autocrine PACAP expression significantly impaired tube formation capacity, mimicking the aging phenotype. Cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (dihydroethidium and MitoSox fluorescence, respectively) were increased in aged CMVECs and were unaffected by PACAP. Collectively, PACAP exerts proangiogenic effects and age-related dysregulation of autocrine PACAP signaling may contribute to impaired angiogenic capacity of CMVECs in aging.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piegeler, Tobias</author><author>Votta-Velis, E Gina</author><author>Bakhshi, Farnaz R</author><author>Mao, Mao</author><author>Carnegie, Graeme</author><author>Bonini, Marcelo G</author><author>Schwartz, David E</author><author>Borgeat, Alain</author><author>Beck-Schimmer, Beatrice</author><author>Minshall, Richard D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial barrier protection by local anesthetics: ropivacaine and lidocaine block tumor necrosis factor-α-induced endothelial cell Src activation.</title><secondary-title>Anesthesiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anesthesiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1414-1428</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Amides</keyword><keyword>Amides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Anesthetics</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lidocaine</keyword><keyword>Lidocaine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Local</keyword><keyword>Local: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Lung: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: administration &amp; dosa</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: antagonists &amp; inhibit</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: enzymology</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24525631</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/ALN.0000000000000174</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525631</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction mediated in part by Src-kinase activation plays a crucial role in acute inflammatory disease. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), activate Src via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt-dependent nitric oxide generation, a process initiated by recruitment of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85 to TNF-receptor-1. Because amide-linked local anesthetics have well-established anti-inflammatory effects, the authors hypothesized that ropivacaine and lidocaine attenuate inflammatory Src signaling by disrupting the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-Akt-nitric oxide pathway, thus blocking Src-dependent neutrophil adhesion and endothelial hyperpermeability. METHODS: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells, incubated with TNFα in the absence or presence of clinically relevant concentrations of ropivacaine and lidocaine, were analyzed by Western blot, probing for phosphorylated/activated Src, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Akt, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and caveolin-1. The effect of ropivacaine on TNFα-induced nitric oxide generation, co-immunoprecipitation of TNF-receptor-1 with p85, neutrophil adhesion, and endothelial barrier disruption were assessed. RESULTS: Ropivacaine and lidocaine attenuated TNFα-induced Src activation (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 8.611 × 10 M for ropivacaine; IC50 = 5.864 × 10 M for lidocaine) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation (IC50 = 7.572 × 10 M for ropivacaine; IC50 = 6.377 × 10 M for lidocaine). Akt activation (n = 7; P = 0.006) and stimulus-dependent binding of TNF-receptor-1 and p85 (n = 6; P = 0.043) were blocked by 1 nM of ropivacaine. TNFα-induced neutrophil adhesion and disruption of endothelial monolayers via Src-dependent intercellular adhesion molecule-1- and caveolin-1-phosphorylation, respectively, were also attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Ropivacaine and lidocaine effectively blocked inflammatory TNFα signaling in endothelial cells by attenuating p85 recruitment to TNF-receptor-1. The resultant decrease in Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and Src phosphorylation reduced neutrophil adhesion and endothelial hyperpermeability. This novel anti-inflammatory &quot;side-effect&quot; of ropivacaine and lidocaine may provide therapeutic benefit in acute inflammatory disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anidi, Ifeanyi U.</author><author>Servinsky, Laura E.</author><author>Rentsendorj, Otgonchimeg</author><author>Stephens, R.

However, the mechanism through which lung fluid conductance is altered during malaria remains unclear. To define the role that the scavenger receptor CD36 may play in mediating this response, C57BL/6J (WT) and CD36-/- mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and monitored for changes in pulmonary endothelial barrier function employing an isolated perfused lung system. WT lungs demonstrated a &gt;10-fold increase in two measures of paracellular fluid conductance and a decrease in the albumin reflection coefficient (σalb) compared to control lungs indicating a loss of barrier function. In contrast, malaria-infected CD36-/- mice had near normal fluid conductance but a similar reduction in σalb. In WT mice, lung sequestered iRBCs demonstrated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To determine whether knockout of CD36 could protect against ROS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, mouse lung microvascular endothelial monolayers (MLMVEC) from WT and CD36-/- mice were exposed to H2O2. Unlike WT monolayers, which showed dose-dependent decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) from H2O2 indicating loss of barrier function, CD36-/- MLMVEC demonstrated dose-dependent increases in TER. The differences between responses in WT and CD36-/- endothelial cells correlated with important differences in the intracellular compartmentalization of the CD36-associated Fyn kinase. Malaria infection increased total lung Fyn levels in CD36-/- lungs compared to WT, but this increase was due to elevated production of the inactive form of Fyn further suggesting a dysregulation of Fyn-mediated signaling. The importance of Fyn in CD36-dependent endothelial signaling was confirmed using in vitro Fyn knockdown as well as Fyn-/- mice, which were also protected from H2O2- and malaria-induced lung endothelial leak, respectively. Our results demonstrate that CD36 and Fyn kinase are critical mediators of the increased lung endothelial fluid conductance caused by malaria infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boratkó, Anita</author><author>Gergely, Pál</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RACK1 is involved in endothelial barrier regulation via its two novel interacting partners</title><secondary-title>Cell Communication and Signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Communication and Signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>prenylation</keyword><keyword>rack1</keyword><keyword>timap</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1478-811x-11-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biosignaling.com/content/11/1/2</url></web-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>Background: RACK1, receptor for activated protein kinase C, serves as an anchor in multiple signaling pathways. TIMAP, TGF-β inhibited membrane-associated protein, is most abundant in endothelial cells with a regulatory effect on the endothelial barrier function. The interaction of TIMAP with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1cδ) was characterized, yet little is known about its further partners. Results: We identified two novel interacting partners of RACK1, namely, TGF-β inhibited membrane-associated protein, TIMAP, and farnesyl transferase. TIMAP is most abundant in endothelial cells where it is involved in the regulation of the barrier function. WD1-4 repeats of RACK1 were identified as critical regions of the interaction both with TIMAP and farnesyl transferase. Phosphorylation of TIMAP by activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway reduced the amount of TIMAP-RACK1 complex and enhanced translocation of TIMAP to the cell membrane in vascular endothelial cells. However, both membrane localization of TIMAP and transendothelial resistance were attenuated after RACK1 depletion. Farnesyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for prenylation and consequent membrane localization of TIMAP, is present in the RACK1-TIMAP complex in control cells, but it does not co-immunoprecipitate with TIMAP after RACK1 depletion. Conclusions: Transient parallel linkage of TIMAP and farnesyl transferase to RACK1 could ensure prenylation and transport of TIMAP to the plasma membrane where it may attend in maintaining the endothelial barrier as a phosphatase regulator.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michaelis, S.</author><author>Wegener, J.</author><author>Robelek, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Label-free monitoring of cell-based assays: Combining impedance analysis with SPR for multiparametric cell profiling</title><secondary-title>Biosensors and Bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors and Bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>63-70</pages><volume>49</volume><keywords><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Label-free detection</keyword><keyword>Real time monitoring</keyword><keyword>Surface plasmon resonance</keyword><keyword>Whole cell biosensors</keyword><keyword>Wholistic sensors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2013.04.042</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Label-free monitoring of cell-based assays Combining impedance analysis with SPR for multiparametric cell profiling.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>Label-free approaches to monitor cell-based assays provide an unprecedented, time-resolved and non-invasive view on the response of mammalian cells to chemical, biological or physical stimuli. The most widespread techniques are impedance analysis and optical sensing using evanescent waves like SPR. This study describes the combination of both in one experimental setup so that a given cell population can be monitored simultaneously for electrical and optical changes. The device is based on commercial SPR chips that are processed by photolithography to provide electrodes for impedance analysis and gold spots for surface plasmon excitation on the same substrate. Simultaneous recordings do not interfere with each other but provide independent, time-resolved information on cell shape changes (impedance) and dynamic mass redistribution (SPR) as they occur during exposure of the cells to drugs or toxins or along their normal life cycle. This study provides proof-of-concept experiments of the dual biosensor platform in two experimental settings: signals are recorded and analyzed (i) during cell attachment, spreading and differentiation of initially suspended cells and (ii) during the exposure of the mature cells to an actin cytoskeleton disrupting drug. Impedance and SPR recordings provide complementary information that can be used to trace and assign intracellular mechanisms of action. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bennet, Devasier</author><author>Kim, Sanghyo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance-Based Cell Culture Platform To Assess Light-Induced Stress Changes with Antagonist Drugs Using Retinal Cells</title><secondary-title>Analytical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>4902-4911</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1021/ac303068t</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1021/ac303068t</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>This Article describes an unprecedented, simple, and real-time in vitro analytical tool to measure the luminous effect on the time responses function of retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) by electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system. The ECIS system was used for the continuous measurement of different color light-induced effects on the response of cells that exposed to protective drugs. The measurement suggests that the association of photo-oxidative stress was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which plays a critical role that leads to cell stress, damages, and retinopathy, resulting in eye degenerative diseases. Continuous light radiation caused time-dependent decline of RGC-5 response and resulted in photodamage within 10 h due to adenosine 5′-triphosphate depletion and increased ROS level, which is similar to in vivo photodamage. The ECIS results were correlated with standard cell viability assay. ECIS is very helpful to determine the protective effects of analyzed drugs such as β-carotene, quercetin, agmatine, and glutathione in RGC-5 cells, and the maximum drug activity of nontoxic safer drug concentrations was found to be 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 1.0 mM, respectively. All drugs show protection against light radiation toxicity in a dose-dependent manner; the most effective drug was found to be glutathione. The proposed system identifies the phototoxic effects in RGC-5 and provides high throughput drug screening for photo-oxidative stress during early stages of drug discovery. This study is convenient and potential enough for the direct measurements of the photoprotective effect in vitro and would be of broad interest in the field of therapeutics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sawada, Norimasa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tight junction-related human diseases</title><secondary-title>Pathology International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pathology International</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/pin.12021</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Tight junctions are intercellular junctions adjacent to the apical ends of paracellular spaces. They have two classical functions, the barrier function and the fence function. The former regulates the passage of ions, water and various molecules through paracellular spaces, and is thus related to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood-borne metastasis. The latter function maintains cell polarity by forming a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane. This function is deeply involved in cancer cell properties in terms of loss of cell polarity. Recently, two novel aspects of tight junctions have been reported. One is their involvement in signal transduction. The other is that fact that tight junctions are considered to be a crucial component of innate immunity. In addition, since some proteins comprising tight junctions work as receptors for viruses and extracellular stimuli, pathogenic bacteria and viruses target and affect the tight junction functions, leading to diseases. In this review, the relationship between tight junctions and human diseases will be described. © 2012 The Author.

They can bind ERM proteins and mediate ERM-membrane protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Binding of ERM to EBP50 and NHERF2 was compared in pulmonary artery endothelial cells by immunoprecipitation. NHERF2 associates with all three ERM, but EBP50 appeared to be a weak binding partner if at all. Furthermore, we detected co-localization of NHERF2 and phospho-ERM at the cell membrane and in the filopodia of dividing cells. Silencing of NHERF2 prevented agonist or angiogenesis induced phosphorylation of ERM, while overexpression of the adaptor elevated the phosphorylation level of ERM, likely catalyzed by Rho kinase 2, which co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF2/ERM in control EC, but did not bind to ERM in NHERF2 depleted cells. Dependence of ERM phosphorylation on NHERF2 was also shown in Matrigel tube formation assay, and NHERF2 was proved to be important in angiogenesis as well. Furthermore, when NHERF2 was depleted or cells were overexpressing a mutant form of NHERF2 unable to bind ERM, we found attenuated cell attachment with ECIS measurements, while it was supported by overexpression of wild type NHERF2.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Pivotal role of NHERF2 in the phosphorylation process of ERM in pulmonary artery endothelial cells is shown. We propose that NHERF2 provides a common anchoring surface for ERM and Rho kinase 2. Our results demonstrate the essential role of NHERF2 in endothelial cell adhesion/migration and angiogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goc, Anna</author><author>Al-Azayzih, Ahmad</author><author>Abdalla, Maha</author><author>Al-Husein, Belal</author><author>Kavuri, Sravankumar</author><author>Lee, Jeffrey</author><author>Moses, Kelvin</author><author>Somanath, Payaningal R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>P21 activated kinase-1 (Pak1) promotes prostate tumor growth and microinvasion via inhibition of transforming growth factor β expression and enhanced matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretion.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>3025-3035</pages><volume>288</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Androgens</keyword><keyword>Androgens: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 9</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 9: secretion</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor beta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays</keyword><keyword>p21-Activated Kinases</keyword><keyword>p21-Activated Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>p21-Activated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23258534</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M112.424770</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3561527&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>P21-activated kinases (Paks) are major effectors downstream of the small Rho family of GTPases. Among the six isoforms, Pak1 is the most ubiquitous and the best characterized member. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of Pak6, which is predominantly present in the prostate compared with other tissues, inhibits prostate tumor growth in vivo. Even though Pak1 has been identified in normal prostatic epithelial cells and cancer cells, its specific role in the development of prostate cancer remains unclear. We report here that highly invasive prostate cancer cells express significantly higher levels of Pak1 protein compared with non-invasive prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, prostate tumor tissues and prostate cancer metastasized to lungs showed a higher expression of Pak1 compared with normal tissues. Interestingly, Pak6 protein expression levels did not change with the invasive/metastatic potential of the cancer cells or tumors. Although inhibition of Pak1, and not Pak6, resulted in impaired PC3 cell migration, the effects of Pak1 knockdown on transendothelial migration (microinvasion), tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis was higher compared with Pak6 knockdown. Finally, gene array data revealed reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 with the ablation of either Pak1 or Pak6 gene expression in PC3 cells, whereas protein levels of TGFβ was elevated significantly with specific modulation of Pak1 activity or ablation of the Pak1 gene. Our observations suggest that although some level of functional redundancy exists between Pak1 and Pak6 in prostate cancer cells, targeting Pak1 is a potential option for the management of prostate tumor growth, microinvasion, and metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Chi-Ming</author><author>Chang, Hsun-Hsien</author><author>Wang, Vin-Chi</author><author>Huang, Chuen-Lin</author><author>Hung, Chi-Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibitory effects of resveratrol on PDGF-BB-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell migration via PDGFRβ, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e56819</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium: cytology</keyword><keyword>Stilbenes</keyword><keyword>Stilbenes: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23457620</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0056819</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3572951&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PURPOSE: In diseases such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells proliferate and migrate. Moreover, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been shown to enhance proliferation and migration of RPE cells in PVR. Even resveratrol can suppress the migration and adhesion of many cell types, its effects on RPE cell migration and adhesion remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on RPE cell migration induced by PDGF-BB, an isoform of PDGF, and adhesion to fibronectin, a major ECM component of PVR tissue. METHODS: The migration of RPE cells was assessed by an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing migration assay and a Transwell migration assay. A cell viability assay was used to determine the viability of resveratrol treated-cells. The cell adhesion to fibronectin was examined by an adhesion assay. The interactions of resveratrol with PDGF-BB were analyzed by a dot binding assay. The PDGF-BB-induced signaling pathways were determined by western blotting and scratch wound healing assay. RESULTS: Resveratrol inhibited PDGF-BB-induced RPE cell migration in a dose-dependent manner, but showed no effects on ARPE19 cell adhesion to fibronectin. The cell viability assay showed no cytotoxicity of resveratrol on RPE cells and the dot binding assay revealed no direct interactions of resveratrol with PDGF-BB. Inhibitory effects of resveratrol on PDGF-BB-induced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) and tyrosine phosphorylation and the underlying pathways of PI3K/Akt, ERK and p38 activation were found; however, resveratrol and PDGF-BB showed no effects on PDGFRα and JNK activation. Scratch wound healing assay demonstrated resveratrol and the specific inhibitors of PDGFR, PI3K, MEK or p38 suppressed PDGF-BB-induced cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that resveratrol is an effective inhibitor of PDGF-BB-induced RPE cell migration via PDGFRβ, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, but has no effects on the RPE cell adhesion to fibronectin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benson, Kathrin</author><author>Cramer, Sandra</author><author>Galla, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance-based cell monitoring: barrier properties and beyond.</title><secondary-title>Fluids and barriers of the CNS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fluids and barriers of the CNS</full-title></periodical><pages>5</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23305242</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/2045-8118-10-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3560213&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Review</label><abstract>In multicellular organisms epithelial and endothelial cells form selective permeable interfaces between tissue compartments of different chemical compositions. Tight junctions which connect adjacent cells, control the passage of molecules across the barrier and, in addition, facilitate active transport processes. The cellular barriers are not static but can be deliberately modulated by exposure to specific external stimuli. In vitro models representing the essential absorption barriers of the body are nowadays available, thus allowing investigation of the parameters that control permeability as well as transport processes across those barriers. Independent of the origin of the barrier forming cells, techniques are needed to quantify their barrier integrity. One simple assay is to measure the permeability for given hydrophilic substrates possessing different molecular weights like sucrose or dextrans. However, this technique is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, radioactive or fluorescently-labeled substrates are needed to allow easy analytical detection. Finally, if transport processes are investigated, the standard permeant may interfere with the transport process under investigation or might even alter the barrier integrity by itself. Thus, independent, non-invasive techniques are needed to quantify the barrier integrity continuously during the experiment. Such techniques are available and are mainly based on the measurement of the transendothelial or transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of barrier forming cells grown on porous membranes. Simple devices using two sets of electrodes (so-called Voltohmeters) are widely used. In addition, an easy-to-use physical technique called impedance spectroscopy allows the continuous analysis of both the TEER and the electrical capacitance giving additional information about the barrier properties of cells grown on permeable membranes. This technique is useful as a quality control for barrier forming cells. Another impedance-based approach requires cells to be grown directly on solid, micro-structured electrodes. Here, we will discuss the physical background of the different techniques; advantages, disadvantages, and applications will be scrutinized. The aim is to give the reader a comprehensive understanding concerning the range and limits of the application, mainly focusing on endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Obiako, Boniface</author><author>Calchary, Wendy</author><author>Xu, Ningyong</author><author>Kunstadt, Ryan</author><author>Richardson, Bianca</author><author>Nix, Jessica</author><author>Sayner, Sarah L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bicarbonate disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier via activation of endogenous soluble adenylyl cyclase, isoform 10.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Studies demonstrate that the exogenous soluble bacterial toxin, ExoY, and heterologous expression of the forskolin-stimulated soluble mammalian adenylyl cyclase (AC) chimera, sACI/II, elevate cytosolic cAMP and disrupt the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier. The barrier-disruptive effects of cytosolic cAMP generated by exogenous soluble ACs are in contrast to the barrier-protective effects of subplasma membrane cAMP generated by transmembrane AC, which strengthens endothelial barrier integrity. Endogenous soluble AC isoform 10 (AC10 or commonly known as sAC) lacks transmembrane domains and localizes within the cytosolic compartment. AC10 is uniquely activated by bicarbonate to generate cytosolic cAMP, yet its role in regulation of endothelial barrier integrity has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate that, within the pulmonary circulation, AC10 is expressed in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), yet expression in PAECs is lower. Furthermore, pulmonary endothelial cells selectively express bicarbonate cotransporters. While extracellular bicarbonate generates a phosphodiesterase 4-sensitive cAMP pool in PMVECs, no such cAMP response is detected in PAECs. Finally, addition of extracellular bicarbonate decreases resistance across the PMVEC monolayer and increases the filtration coefficient in the isolated perfused lung above osmolality controls. Collectively, these findings suggest that PMVECs have a bicarbonate-sensitive cytosolic cAMP pool that disrupts endothelial barrier integrity. These studies could provide an alternative mechanism for the controversial effects of bicarbonate correction of acidosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dewitt, Sharon</author><author>Francis, Robert J</author><author>Hallett, Maurice B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ca²⁺ and calpain control membrane expansion during the rapid cell spreading of neutrophils.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>4627-4635</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>Pt 20</issue><keywords><keyword>4</keyword><keyword>5-Trisphosphate</keyword><keyword>5-Trisphosphate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calpain</keyword><keyword>Calpain: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Shape</keyword><keyword>Cell Shape: physiology</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inositol 1</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: cytology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phagocytosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23943875</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.124917</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3795336&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Following adherence of neutrophils to the endothelium, neutrophils undergo a major morphological change that is a necessary prelude to their extravasation. We show here that this shape change is triggered by an elevation of cytosolic inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), to provoke physiological Ca(2+) influx through a store-operated mechanism. This transition from a spherical to 'flattened' neutrophil morphology is rapid (∼100 seconds) and is accompanied by an apparent rapid expansion of the area of the plasma membrane. However, no new membrane is added into the plasma membrane. Pharmacological inhibition of calpain-activation, which is triggered by Ca(2+) influx during neutrophil spreading, prevents normal cell flattening. In calpain-suppressed cells, an aberrant form of cell spreading can occur where an uncoordinated and localised expansion of the plasma membrane is evident. These data show that rapid neutrophil spreading is triggered by Ca(2+) influx, which causes activation of calpain and release of furled plasma membrane to allow its apparent 'expansion'.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Audia, Jonathon P</author><author>Lindsey, Ashley S</author><author>Housley, Nicole a.</author><author>Ochoa, Courtney R</author><author>Zhou, Chun</author><author>Toba, Michie</author><author>Oka, Masahiko</author><author>Annamdevula, Naga S</author><author>Fitzgerald, Meshann S</author><author>Frank, Dara W</author><author>Alvarez, Diego F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In the Absence of Effector Proteins, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Type Three Secretion System Needle Tip Complex Contributes to Lung Injury and Systemic Inflammatory Responses</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e81792</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0081792</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081792</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Chongxiu</author><author>Beard, Richard S</author><author>McLean, Danielle L</author><author>Rigor, Robert R</author><author>Konia, Thomas</author><author>Wu, Mack H</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAM15 deficiency attenuates pulmonary hyperpermeability and acute lung injury in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We have recently characterized ADAM15 as a mediator of endothelial barrier dysfunction. Whether this molecule contributes to acute inflammation has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ADAM15 in mediating pulmonary microvascular leakage during acute inflammatory injury. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting revealed that the endothelium was the main source of ADAM15 in lung tissue. In a mouse model of acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), upregulation of ADAM15 was observed in association with pulmonary edema and neutrophil infiltration. The LPS-induced inflammatory injury, as demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil count, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and myeloperoxidase activity, was significantly attenuated in Adam15(-/-) mice. Studies with primary cell culture demonstrated abundant ADAM15 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) of mouse lung but not in neutrophils. Deficiency of ADAM15 in ECs had no obvious effect on basal permeability but significantly attenuated hyperpermeability response to LPS as evidenced by albumin flux assay and measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance, respectively. ADAM15 deficiency also reduced neutrophil chemotactic transmigration across endothelial barriers in the presence or absence of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Rescue expression of ADAM15 in Adam15(-/-) ECs restored neutrophil transendothelial migration. These data indicate that ADAM15 upregulation contributes to inflammatory lung injury by promoting endothelial hyperpermeability and neutrophil transmigration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lipiski, Miriam</author><author>Deuel, Jeremy W</author><author>Baek, Jin Hyen</author><author>Engelsberger, Wolfgang R</author><author>Buehler, Paul W</author><author>Schaer, Dominik J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human Hp1-1 and Hp2-2 phenotype-specific haptoglobin therapeutics are both effective in vitro and in guinea pigs to attenuate hemoglobin toxicity.</title><secondary-title>Antioxidants &amp; redox signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antioxidants &amp; redox signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>1619-1633</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Guinea Pigs</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobins</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>LDL</keyword><keyword>LDL: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lipid Peroxidation</keyword><keyword>Lipid Peroxidation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23418677</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/ars.2012.5089</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3809386&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>AIMS: Infusion of purified haptoglobin (Hp) functions as an effective hemoglobin (Hb) scavenging therapeutic in animal models of hemolysis to prevent cardiovascular and renal injury. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate the phenotype heterogeneity of human Hp proteins and suggest differing vascular protective potential imparted by the dimeric Hp1-1 and the polymeric Hp2-2. RESULTS: In vitro experiments and in vivo studies in guinea pigs were performed to evaluate phenotype-specific differences in Hp therapeutics. We found no differences between the two phenotypes in Hb binding and intravascular compartmentalization of Hb in vivo. Both Hp1-1 and Hp2-2 attenuate Hb-induced blood pressure response and renal iron deposition. These findings were consistent with equal prevention of Hb endothelial translocation. The modulation of oxidative Hb reactions by the two Hp phenotypes was not found to be different. Both phenotypes stabilize the ferryl (Fe(4+)) Hb transition state, provide heme retention within the complex, and prevent Hb-driven low-density lipoprotein (LDL) peroxidation. Hb-mediated peroxidation of LDL resulted in endothelial toxicity, which was equally blocked by the addition of Hp1-1 and Hp2-2. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: The present data do not provide support for the concept that phenotype-specific Hp therapeutics offer differential efficacy in mitigating acute Hb toxicity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Post, a.</author><author>Pannekoek, W.-J.</author><author>Ross, S H</author><author>Verlaan, I</author><author>Brouwer, P M</author><author>Bos, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rasip1 mediates Rap1 regulation of Rho in endothelial barrier function through ArhGAP29</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-6</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1306595110</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1306595110</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Shiqin</author><author>Sursal, Tolga</author><author>Adibnia, Yasaman</author><author>Zhao, Cong</author><author>Zheng, Yi</author><author>Li, Haipeng</author><author>Otterbein, Leo E</author><author>Hauser, Carl J</author><author>Itagaki, Kiyoshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitochondrial DAMPs increase endothelial permeability through neutrophil dependent and independent pathways.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e59989</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23527291</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0059989</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3603956&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Trauma and sepsis can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in part by triggering neutrophil (PMN)-mediated increases in endothelial cell (EC) permeability. We had shown that mitochondrial (mt) damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) appear in the blood after injury or shock and activate human PMN. So we now hypothesized that mitochondrial DAMPs (MTD) like mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and peptides might play a role in increased EC permeability during systemic inflammation and proceeded to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. MtDNA induced changes in EC permeability occurred in two phases: a brief, PMN-independent 'spike' in permeability was followed by a prolonged PMN-dependent increase in permeability. Fragmented mitochondria (MTD) caused PMN-independent increase in EC permeability that were abolished with protease treatment. Exposure to mtDNA caused PMN-EC adherence by activating expression of adherence molecule expression in both cell types. Cellular activation was manifested as an increase in PMN calcium flux and EC MAPK phosphorylation. Permeability and PMN adherence were attenuated by endosomal TLR inhibitors. EC lacked formyl peptide receptors but were nonetheless activated by mt-proteins, showing that non-formylated mt-protein DAMPs can activate EC. Mitochondrial DAMPs can be released into the circulation by many processes that cause cell injury and lead to pathologic endothelial permeability. We show here that mitochondria contain multiple DAMP motifs that can act on EC and/or PMN via multiple pathways. This can enhance PMN adherence to EC, activate PMN-EC interactions and subsequently increase systemic endothelial permeability. Mitochondrial DAMPs may be important therapeutic targets in conditions where inflammation pathologically increases endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Migliorini, Adriana</author><author>Angelotti, Maria L</author><author>Mulay, Shrikant R</author><author>Kulkarni, Onkar O</author><author>Demleitner, Jana</author><author>Dietrich, Alexander</author><author>Sagrinati, Costanza</author><author>Ballerini, Lara</author><author>Peired, Anna</author><author>Shankland, Stuart J</author><author>Liapis, Helen</author><author>Romagnani, Paola</author><author>Anders, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The antiviral cytokines IFN-α and IFN-β modulate parietal epithelial cells and promote podocyte loss: implications for IFN toxicity, viral glomerulonephritis, and glomerular regeneration.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>431-440</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antiviral Agents</keyword><keyword>Antiviral Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Death</keyword><keyword>Cell Death: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Glomerulonephritis</keyword><keyword>Glomerulonephritis: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Glomerulonephritis: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interferon-alpha</keyword><keyword>Interferon-alpha: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Interferon-beta</keyword><keyword>Interferon-beta: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus</keyword><keyword>Kidney Glomerulus: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Podocytes</keyword><keyword>Podocytes: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Regeneration</keyword><keyword>Regeneration: drug effects</keyword><keyword>SCID</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>American Society for Investigative Pathology</publisher><accession-num>23747509</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.04.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23747509</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Virology</label><abstract>Interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β are the central regulators of antiviral immunity but little is known about their roles in viral glomerulonephritis (eg, HIV nephropathy). We hypothesized that IFN-α and IFN-β would trigger local inflammation and podocyte loss. We found that both IFNs consistently activated human and mouse podocytes and parietal epithelial cells to express numerous IFN-stimulated genes. However, only IFN-β significantly induced podocyte death and increased the permeability of podocyte monolayers. In contrast, only IFN-α caused cell-cycle arrest and inhibited the migration of parietal epithelial cells. Both IFNs suppressed renal progenitor differentiation into mature podocytes. In Adriamycin nephropathy, injections with either IFN-α or IFN-β aggravated proteinuria, macrophage influx, and glomerulosclerosis. A detailed analysis showed that only IFN-β induced podocyte mitosis. This did not, however, lead to proliferation, but was associated with podocyte loss via podocyte detachment and/or mitotic podocyte death (mitotic catastrophe). We did not detect TUNEL-positive podocytes. Thus, IFN-α and IFN-β have both common and differential effects on podocytes and parietal epithelial cells, which together promote glomerulosclerosis by enhancing podocyte loss while suppressing podocyte regeneration from local progenitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dalli, Jesmond</author><author>Winkler, Jeremy W.

Here, temporal metabololipidomics with self-limited resolving exudates revealed that resolvin (Rv) D3 has a distinct time frame from other lipid mediators, appearing late in the resolution phase. Using synthetic materials prepared by stereocontrolled total organic synthesis and metabololipidomics, we established complete stereochemistry of RvD3 and its aspirin-triggered 17R-epimer (AT-RvD3). Both synthetic resolvins potently regulated neutrophils and mediators, reducing murine peritonitis and dermal inflammation. RvD3 and AT-RvD3 displayed leukocyte-directed actions, e.g., blocking human neutrophil transmigration and enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and efferocytosis. These results position RvD3 uniquely within the inflammation-resolution time frame to vantage and contribute to the beneficial actions of aspirin and essential n-3 fatty acids. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yin, Yukun</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) on breast cancer cells in vitro and its clinical significance.</title><secondary-title>Anticancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>1499-1509</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Breast</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Breast: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast: secondary</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Ductal</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoenzyme Techniques</keyword><keyword>In Vitro Techniques</keyword><keyword>Lobular</keyword><keyword>Lobular: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lobular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lobular: secondary</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Grading</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Staging</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0030229505338</isbn><accession-num>23564791</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/33/4/1499.short</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23564791</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND/AIM: Angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP), which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, was found to be expressed in different human cell lines and exhibited a predominant cytosolic localization in epithelial cells. Previous studies show that the specific gene product is functional in cell migration and angiogenesis and can also be used as a marker of poor prognosis in invasive gastrointestinal stromal tumours and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. However, the cellular role of AAMP in breast cancer is still unclear. The aim of the current study was to provide new insights into the implication of AAMP in breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We knocked-down the expression of AAMP through transfection of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with a hammerhead ribozyme transgene (MCF-7(AAMPrib) and MDA-MB-231(AAMPrib)) and examined the impact on cell function using in vitro assays. Additionally, AAMP expression was examined in a cohort of breast specimens (normal, n=28; cancer, n=102) using quantitative-real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: AAMP knock-down dramatically reduced cell adhesion and cell growth of MCF-7 cells (p&lt;0.05), and suppressed cell invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (p&lt;0.05). Increased expression of AAMP in breast cancer was observed compared with that in normal tissues (p&lt;0.05). High levels of AAMP transcripts were associated with disease progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis of the patients. Disease-free and overall survival time of patients with lower levels of AAMP were significantly longer compared to those of patients with high levels (p&lt;0.05).

Posttranslational modifications of Hsp90 have been reported in tumors and have been hypothesized to affect client protein- and inhibitor-binding activities. In the present study we investigated the posttranslational modification of Hsp90 in inflammation. LPS, a prototypical inflammatory agent, induced concentration- and time-dependent tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of Hsp90α and Hsp90β in bovine pulmonary arterial and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Mass spectrometry identified Y309 as a major site of Y phosphorylation on Hsp90α (Y300 of Hsp90β). LPS-induced Hsp90 phosphorylation was prevented by the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) in vitro as well as in lungs from LPS-treated mice, in vivo. Furthermore, 17-AAG prevented LPS-induced pp60src activation. LPS-induced Hsp90 phosphorylation was also prevented by the pp60src inhibitor PP2. Additionally, Hsp90 phosphorylation was induced by infecting cells with a constitutively active pp60src adenovirus, whereas either a dominant-negative pp60src adenovirus or reduced expression of pp60src by a specific siRNA prevented the LPS-induced Y phosphorylation of Hsp90. Transfection of HLMVEC with the nonphosphorylatable Hsp90β Y300F mutant prevented LPS-induced Hsp90β tyrosine phosphorylation but not pp60src activation. Furthermore, the Hsp90β Y300F mutant showed a reduced ability to bind the Hsp90 client proteins eNOS and pp60src and HLMVEC transfected with the mutant exhibited reduced LPS-induced barrier dysfunction. We conclude that inflammatory stimuli cause posttranslational modifications of Hsp90 that are Hsp90-inhibitor sensitive and may be important to the proinflammatory actions of Hsp90.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alieva, Irina B</author><author>Zemskov, Evgeny A</author><author>Smurova, Ksenija M</author><author>Kaverina, Irina N</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The leading role of microtubules in endothelial barrier dysfunction: disassembly of peripheral microtubules leaves behind the cytoskeletal reorganization.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>2258-2272</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microtubules</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23606375</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcb.24575</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3901434&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Disturbance of the endothelial barrier is characterized by dramatic cytoskeleton reorganization, activation of actomyosin contraction and, finally, leads to intercellular gap formation. Here we demonstrate that the edemagenic agent, thrombin, causes a rapid increase in the human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (EC) barrier permeability accompanied by fast decreasing in the peripheral microtubules quantity and reorganization of the microtubule system in the internal cytoplasm of the EC within 5 min of the treatment. The actin stress-fibers formation occurs gradually and the maximal effect is observed relatively later, 30 min of the thrombin treatment. Thus, microtubules reaction develops faster than the reorganization of the actin filaments system responsible for the subsequent changes of the cell shape during barrier dysfunction development. Direct microtubules depolymerization by nocodazole initiates the cascade of barrier dysfunction reactions. Nocodazole-induced barrier disruption is connected directly with the degree of peripheral microtubules depolymerization. Short-term loss of endothelial barrier function occurs at the minimal destruction of peripheral microtubules, when actin filament system is still intact. Specifically, we demonstrate that the EC microtubule dynamics examined by time-lapse imaging of EB3-GFP comets movement has changed under these conditions: microtubule plus ends growth rate significantly decreased near the cell periphery. The microtubules, apparently, are the first target in the circuit of reactions leading to the pulmonary EC barrier compromise. Our results show that dynamic microtubules play an essential role in the barrier function in vitro; peripheral microtubules depolymerization is necessary and sufficient condition for initiation of endothelial barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Predescu, Sanda</author><author>Knezevic, Ivana</author><author>Bardita, Cristina</author><author>Neamu, Radu Florin</author><author>Brovcovych, Viktor</author><author>Predescu, Dan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet activating factor-induced ceramide micro-domains drive endothelial NOS activation and contribute to barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e75846</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24086643</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0075846</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3785431&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The spatial and functional relationship between platelet activating factor-receptor (PAF-R) and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the lateral plane of the endothelial plasma membrane is poorly characterized. In this study, we used intact mouse pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) as well as endothelial plasma membrane patches and subcellular fractions to define a new microdomain of plasmalemma proper where the two proteins colocalize and to demonstrate how PAF-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production fine-tunes ECs function as gatekeepers of vascular permeability. Using fluorescence microscopy and immunogold labeling electron microscopy (EM) on membrane patches we demonstrate that PAF-R is organized as clusters and colocalizes with a subcellular pool of eNOS, outside recognizable vesicular profiles. Moreover, PAF-induced acid sphingomyelinase activation generates a ceramide-based microdomain on the external leaflet of plasma membrane, inside of which a signalosome containing eNOS shapes PAF-stimulated NO production. Real-time measurements of NO after PAF-R ligation indicated a rapid (5 to 15 min) increase in NO production followed by a &gt; 45 min period of reduction to basal levels. Moreover, at the level of this new microdomain, PAF induces a dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser, Thr and Tyr residues of eNOS that correlates with NO production. Altogether, our findings establish the existence of a functional partnership PAF-R/eNOS on EC plasma membrane, at the level of PAF-induced ceramide plasma membrane microdomains, outside recognized vesicular profiles.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lam, B Daniel</author><author>Anthony, Eloise C</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytoplasmic targeting of the proto-oncogene SET promotes cell spreading and migration.</title><secondary-title>FEBS letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEBS letters</full-title></periodical><pages>111-119</pages><volume>587</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Active Transport</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Structures</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Structures: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm: metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers: genetics</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Histone Chaperones</keyword><keyword>Histone Chaperones: genetics</keyword><keyword>Histone Chaperones: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Mutant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Mutant Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutant Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Localization Signals</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Localization Signals: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Phosphatase 2</keyword><keyword>Protein Phosphatase 2: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23195690</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.febslet.2012.11.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195690</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The RhoGTPase Rac1 is activated in a polarised fashion and controls cell motility.

Here, an analytical application of a bioimpedance system was developed to quantify cell morphology changes in light-induced anatomical response. Hence, an unprecedented light setup was established using a bioimpedance system to generate artificial light that stresses retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and the corresponding impedance was recorded. The dynamics of initial light-induced stress and the morphological changes were examined. This examination showed impedance drop, and the normalized variance ratios were used to quantify the changes. A rapid impedance drop was measured after exposure to the red and blue lights, whereas it was found that a minimum impedance drop was analyzed under the green light exposure. These data have revealed a strong, unconventional reliable model to detect the onset changes for photo-oxidative stress-related studies by the morphological changes of neurite retraction and cell body shrinkage. The data revealed that functions of the RGC-5 cell line under light exposure were diminished in cell strength and activity was hindered. These reduced functions might be related to the declined levels of some protein markers and stress factors. This is an effective model to study stress, morphological changes, and photodamage.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burghardt, Tillmann</author><author>Kastner, Jürgen</author><author>Suleiman, Hani</author><author>Rivera-Milla, Eric</author><author>Stepanova, Natalya</author><author>Lottaz, Claudio</author><author>Kubitza, Marion</author><author>Böger, Carsten A</author><author>Schmidt, Sarah</author><author>Gorski, Mathias</author><author>de Vries, Uwe</author><author>Schmidt, Helga</author><author>Hertting, Irmgard</author><author>Kopp, Jeffrey</author><author>Rascle, Anne</author><author>Moser, Markus</author><author>Heid, Iris M</author><author>Warth, Richard</author><author>Spang, Rainer</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Mierke, Claudia T</author><author>Englert, Christoph</author><author>Witzgall, Ralph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LMX1B is Essential for the Maintenance of Differentiated Podocytes in Adult Kidneys.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23990680</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1681/ASN.2012080788</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990680</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutations of the LMX1B gene cause nail-patella syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder affecting the development of the limbs, eyes, brain, and kidneys. The characterization of conventional Lmx1b knockout mice has shown that LMX1B regulates the development of podocyte foot processes and slit diaphragms, but studies using podocyte-specific Lmx1b knockout mice have yielded conflicting results regarding the importance of LMX1B for maintaining podocyte structures. In order to address this question, we generated inducible podocyte-specific Lmx1b knockout mice. One week of Lmx1b inactivation in adult mice resulted in proteinuria with only minimal foot process effacement. Notably, expression levels of slit diaphragm and basement membrane proteins remained stable at this time point, and basement membrane charge properties also did not change, suggesting that alternative mechanisms mediate the development of proteinuria in these mice. Cell biological and biophysical experiments with primary podocytes isolated after 1 week of Lmx1b inactivation indicated dysregulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, and time-resolved DNA microarray analysis identified the genes encoding actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including Abra and Arl4c, as putative LMX1B targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in conditionally immortalized human podocytes and gel shift assays showed that LMX1B recognizes AT-rich binding sites (FLAT elements) in the promoter regions of ABRA and ARL4C, and knockdown experiments in zebrafish support a model in which LMX1B and ABRA act in a common pathway during pronephros development. Our report establishes the importance of LMX1B in fully differentiated podocytes and argues that LMX1B is essential for the maintenance of an appropriately structured actin cytoskeleton in podocytes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuckleburg, Christopher J</author><author>Newman, Peter J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neutrophil proteinase 3 acts on protease-activated receptor-2 to enhance vascular endothelial cell barrier function.</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>275-284</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Calcium Signaling</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoantigens</keyword><keyword>Isoantigens: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myeloblastin</keyword><keyword>Myeloblastin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Myeloblastin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: enzymology</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: genetics</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>PAR-2</keyword><keyword>PAR-2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23202369</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300474</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3562705&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Calcium Signaling;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>OBJECTIVE: The principle role of the vascular endothelium is to present a semi-impermeable barrier to soluble factors and circulating cells, while still permitting the passage of leukocytes from the bloodstream into the tissue. The process of diapedesis involves the selective disruption of endothelial cell junctions, which could compromise vascular integrity. It is therefore somewhat surprising that neutrophil transmigration does not significantly impair endothelial barrier function. We examined whether neutrophils might secrete factors that promote vascular integrity during the latter stages of neutrophil transmigration, in particular, the role of neutrophil serine proteinase 3 (PR3). METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial cells were treated with PR3 either in its soluble form or in a complex form with cell surface NB1. We observed that PR3 mediated the enhancement of endothelial cell junctional integrity and that this required its proteolytic activity, as well as endothelial cell expression of the protease-activated receptor-2. Importantly, PR3 suppressed the vascular permeability changes and disruption of junctional proteins induced by the action of protease-activated receptor-1 agonists. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish the potential for neutrophil-derived PR3 to play a role in reestablishing vascular integrity after leukocyte transmigration and in protecting endothelial cells from protease-activated receptor-1-induced permeability changes that occur during thrombotic and inflammatory events.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martins, Tânia</author><author>Burgoyne, Thomas</author><author>Kenny, Bridget Ann</author><author>Hudson, Natalie</author><author>Futter, Clare E</author><author>Ambrósio, António F</author><author>Silva, Ana P</author><author>Greenwood, John</author><author>Turowski, Patric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Methamphetamine-induced nitric oxide promotes vesicular transport in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Neuropharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>74-82</pages><volume>65</volume><keywords><keyword>Blood-brain barrier</keyword><keyword>Fluid-phase transcytosis</keyword><keyword>Methamphetamine</keyword><keyword>Nitric oxide</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial leukocyte migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>22960442</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.08.021</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Methamphetamine's (METH) neurotoxicity is thought to be in part due to its ability to induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Here, we investigated the effect of METH on barrier properties of cultured rat primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). Transendothelial flux doubled in response to METH, irrespective of the size of tracer used. At the same time, transendothelial electrical resistance was unchanged as was the ultrastructural appearance of inter-endothelial junctions and the distribution of key junction proteins, suggesting that METH promoted vesicular but not junctional transport. Indeed, METH significantly increased uptake of horseradish peroxidase into vesicular structures. METH also enhanced transendothelial migration of lymphocytes indicating that the endothelial barrier against both molecules and cells was compromised. Barrier breakdown was only observed in response to METH at low micromolar concentrations, with enhanced vesicular uptake peaking at 1 μM METH. The BMVEC response to METH also involved rapid activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and its inhibition abrogated METH-induced permeability and lymphocyte migration, indicating that nitric oxide was a key mediator of BBB disruption in response to METH. This study underlines the key role of nitric oxide in BBB function and describes a novel mechanism of drug-induced fluid-phase transcytosis at the BBB. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The precise mechanisms of its cytotoxic effects remain unclear.  METHODS: Cell viability was studied using CCK8 assay. Cell proliferation was measured real-time on cultured cells using Electric Cell Substrate Impedence Sensing (ECIS). Apoptosis was assayed by Caspase activity on cultured lung cancer cells and TUNEL staining on tissue sections. Expression of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes (HSP70, BIRC5, BIRC4, BIRC2, UACA, APAF-1) was estimated by qRTPCR. Effect of Minnelide on proliferative cells in the tissue was estimated by Ki-67 staining of animal tissue sections.  RESULTS: In this study, we investigated in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of triptolide/Minnelide in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Triptolide/Minnelide exhibited anti-proliferative effects and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC mouse models. Triptolide/Minnelide significantly down-regulated the expression of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes (HSP70, BIRC5, BIRC4, BIRC2, UACA) and up-regulated pro-apoptotic APAF-1 gene, in part, via attenuating the NF-κB signaling activity.  CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results provide supporting mechanistic evidence for Minnelide as a potential in NSCLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schäfer, Edith</author><author>Aue, Dennis</author><author>Tarantola, Marco</author><author>Polo, Elena</author><author>Westendorf, Christian</author><author>Oikawa, Noriko</author><author>Bodenschatz, Eberhard</author><author>Geil, Burkhard</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collective behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum monitored by impedance analysis</title><secondary-title>Communicative and Integrative Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communicative and Integrative Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e23894</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CAMP</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium discoideum</keyword><keyword>Impedance analysis</keyword><keyword>Oscillation</keyword><keyword>Starvation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/cib.23894</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cib.23894</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>Dictyostelium discoideum cells respond to periodic signals of extracellular cAMP by collective changes of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts.

Tryptase stimulation of normal urothelial cells resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2). A 5.5-fold increase in ERK 1/2 activity was observed in urothelial cells isolated from IC/PBS bladders. No significant change in p38 MAP kinase was observed in tryptase-stimulated normal urothelial cells but a 2.5-fold increase was observed in cells isolated from IC/PBS bladders. Inhibition of ERK 1/2 with PD98059 or inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with SB203580 did not block tryptase-stimulated iPLA2 activation. Incubation with the membrane phospholipid-derived PLA2 hydrolysis product lysoplasmenylcholine increased ERK 1/2 activity, suggesting the iPLA2 activation is upstream of ERK 1/2. Real time measurements of impedance to evaluate wound healing of cell cultures indicated increased healing rates in normal and IC/PBS urothelial cells in the presence of tryptase, with inhibition of ERK 1/2 significantly decreasing the wound healing rate of IC/PBS urothelium. We conclude that activation of ERK 1/2 in response to tryptase stimulation may facilitate wound healing or cell motility in areas of inflammation in the bladder associated with IC/PBS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Changwon</author><author>Kim, Tae Min</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptional regulation of endothelial cell and vascular development</title><secondary-title>Circulation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1380-1400</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>Reprogramming</keyword><keyword>Transcription factors</keyword><keyword>Vasculogenesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23661712</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301078</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The establishment and maintenance of the vascular system is critical for embryonic development and postnatal life.

Two major isoforms of TCL1 Protooncogenes (TCL1 and TCL1b) are present adjacent to each other on human chromosome 14q.32. In human T-PLL, both TCL1 and TCL1b are activated by chromosomal translocation. Moreover, TCL1b-transgenic mice have never been created. Therefore, it remains unclear whether TCL1b itself, independent of TCL1, exhibits oncogenicity. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, both ectopic and endogenous TCL1b interacted with Akt. In in vitro Akt kinase assays, TCL1b enhanced Akt kinase activity in dose- and time-dependent manners. Bioinformatics approaches utilizing multiregression analysis, cluster analysis, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway mapping, Venn diagrams and Gene Ontology (GO) demonstrated that TCL1b showed highly homologous gene-induction signatures similar to Myr-Akt or TCL1. TCL1b exhibited oncogenicity in in vitro colony-transformation assay. Further, two independent lines of β-actin promoter-driven TCL1b-transgenic mice developed angiosarcoma on the intestinal tract. Angiosarcoma is a rare form of cancer in humans with poor prognosis. Using immunohistochemistry, 11 out of 13 human angiosarcoma samples were positively stained with both anti-TCL1b and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Consistently, in various cancer tissues, 69 out of 146 samples were positively stained with anti-TCL1b, out of which 46 were positively stained with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Moreover, TCL1b structure-based inhibitor 'TCL1b-Akt-in' inhibited Akt kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)-induced Akt kinase activities-in turn, 'TCL1b-Akt-in' inhibited cellular proliferation of sarcoma. The current study disclosed TCL1b bears oncogenicity and hence serves as a novel therapeutic target for human neoplastic diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kluger, Martin S</author><author>Clark, Paul R</author><author>Tellides, George</author><author>Gerke, Volker</author><author>Pober, Jordan S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Claudin-5 controls intercellular barriers of human dermal microvascular but not human umbilical vein endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>489-500</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>microvessel</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23288152</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300893</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To assess the role claudin-5, an endothelial cell (EC) tight junction protein, plays in establishing basal permeability levels in humans by comparing claudin-5 expression levels in situ and analyzing junctional organization and function in 2 widely used models of cultured ECs, namely human dermal microvascular (HDM)ECs and human umbilical vein (HUV)ECs.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: By immunofluorescence microscopy, ECs more highly express claudin-5 (but equivalently express vascular endothelial-cadherin) in human dermal capillaries versus postcapillary venules and in umbilical and coronary arteries versus veins, correlating with known segmental differences in tight junction frequencies and permeability barriers. Postconfluent cultured HDMECs express more claudin-5 (but equivalent vascular endothelial-cadherin) and show higher transendothelial electric resistance and lower macromolecular flux than similarly cultured HUVECs. HDMEC junctions are more complex by transmission electron microscopy and show more continuous claudin-5 immunofluorescence than HUVEC junctions. Calcium chelation or dominant negative vascular endothelial-cadherin overexpression decreases transendothelial electric resistance and disrupts junctions in HUVECs, but not in HDMECs. Claudin-5 overexpression in HUVECs fails to increase transendothelial electric resistance or claudin-5 continuity, whereas claudin-5 knockdown in HDMECs, but not in HUVECs, reduces transendothelial electric resistance and increases antibody accessibility to junctional proteins.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Claudin-5 expression and junctional organization control HDMEC and arteriolar-capillary paracellular barriers, whereas HUVEC and venular junctions use vascular endothelial-cadherin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alipour, Misagh</author><author>Lou, Yuefei</author><author>Zimmerman, Daniel</author><author>Bording-Jorgensen, Michael W</author><author>Sergi, Consolato</author><author>Liu, Julia J</author><author>Wine, Eytan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A balanced IL-1β activity is required for host response to Citrobacter rodentium infection.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e80656</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24312491</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0080656</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3846666&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function</label><abstract>Microbial sensing plays essential roles in the innate immune response to pathogens. In particular, NLRP3 forms a multiprotein inflammasome complex responsible for the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1β. Our aim was to delineate the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, and the contribution of IL-1β to the host defense against Citrobacter rodentium acute infection in mice. Nlrp3(-/-) and background C57BL/6 (WT) mice were infected by orogastric gavage, received IL-1β (0.5 µg/mouse; ip) on 0, 2, and 4 days post-infection (DPI), and assessed on 6 and 10 DPI. Infected Nlrp3(-/-) mice developed severe colitis; IL-1β treatments reduced colonization, abrogated dissemination of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes, and protected epithelial integrity of infected Nlrp3(-/-) mice. In contrast, IL-1β treatments of WT mice had an opposite effect with increased penetration of bacteria and barrier disruption. Microscopy showed reduced damage in Nlrp3(-/-) mice, and increased severity of disease in WT mice with IL-1β treatments, in particular on 10 DPI. Secretion of some pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines was dissipated in Nlrp3(-/-) compared to WT mice. IL-1β treatments elevated macrophage infiltration into infected crypts in Nlrp3(-/-) mice, suggesting that IL-1β may improve macrophage function, as exogenous administration of IL-1β increased phagocytosis of C. rodentium by peritoneal Nlrp3(-/-) macrophages in vitro. As well, the exogenous administration of IL-1β to WT peritoneal macrophages damaged the epithelial barrier of C. rodentium-infected polarized CMT-93 cells. Treatment of Nlrp3(-/-) mice with IL-1β seems to confer protection against C. rodentium infection by reducing colonization, protecting epithelial integrity, and improving macrophage activity, while extraneous IL-1β appeared to be detrimental to WT mice. Together, these findings highlight the importance of balanced cytokine responses as IL-1β improved bacterial clearance in Nlrp3(-/-) mice but increased tissue damage when given to WT mice.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Banerjee, Sulagna</author><author>Sangwan, Veena</author><author>McGinn, Olivia</author><author>Chugh, Rohit</author><author>Dudeja, Vikas</author><author>Vickers, Selwyn M</author><author>Saluja, Ashok K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Triptolide-induced cell death in pancreatic cancer is mediated by O-GlcNAc modification of transcription factor Sp1.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>33927-33938</pages><volume>288</volume><issue>47</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetylglucosamine</keyword><keyword>Acetylglucosamine: genetics</keyword><keyword>Acetylglucosamine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Active Transport</keyword><keyword>Alkylating</keyword><keyword>Alkylating: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Cell Death</keyword><keyword>Cell Death: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Death: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Diterpenes</keyword><keyword>Diterpenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Epoxy Compounds</keyword><keyword>Epoxy Compounds: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Glycosylation</keyword><keyword>Glycosylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins</keyword><keyword>HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases: antagonists &amp; in</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases: genetics</keyword><keyword>N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B: genetics</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Phenanthrenes</keyword><keyword>Phenanthrenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: genetics</keyword><keyword>Sp1 Transcription Factor</keyword><keyword>Sp1 Transcription Factor: genetics</keyword><keyword>Sp1 Transcription Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24129563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M113.500983</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3837133&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Pancreatic cancer, the fourth most prevalent cancer-related cause of death in the United States, is a disease with a dismal survival rate of 5% 5 years after diagnosis. One of the survival proteins responsible for its extraordinary ability to evade cell death is HSP70. A naturally derived compound, triptolide, and its water-soluble prodrug, Minnelide, down-regulate the expression of this protein in pancreatic cancer cells, thereby causing cell death. However, the mechanism of action of triptolide has not been elucidated. Our study shows that triptolide-induced down-regulation of HSP70 expression is associated with a decrease in glycosylation of the transcription factor Sp1. We further show that triptolide inhibits glycosylation of Sp1, inhibiting the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase. Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase prevents nuclear localization of Sp1 and affects its DNA binding activity. This in turn down-regulates prosurvival pathways like NF-κB, leading to inhibition of HSF1 and HSP70 and eventually to cell death. In this study, we evaluated the mechanism by which triptolide affects glycosylation of Sp1, which in turn affects downstream pathways controlling survival of pancreatic cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khare, Vineeta</author><author>Lyakhovich, Alex</author><author>Dammann, Kyle</author><author>Lang, Michaela</author><author>Borgmann, Melanie</author><author>Tichy, Boris</author><author>Pospisilova, Sarka</author><author>Luciani, Gloria</author><author>Campregher, Christoph</author><author>Evstatiev, Rayko</author><author>Pflueger, Maren</author><author>Hundsberger, Harald</author><author>Gasche, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mesalamine modulates intercellular adhesion through inhibition of p-21 activated kinase-1</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>234-244</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Beta-catenin</keyword><keyword>Cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>E-cadherin</keyword><keyword>Mesalamine</keyword><keyword>PAK1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23146664</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bcp.2012.10.026</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Mesalamine (5-ASA) is widely used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, a remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. Knowledge about the molecular and cellular targets of 5-ASA is limited and a clear understanding of its activity in intestinal homeostasis and interference with neoplastic progression is lacking. We sought to identify molecular pathways interfered by 5-ASA, using CRC cell lines with different genetic background. Microarray was performed for gene expression profile of 5-ASA-treated and untreated cells (HCT116 and HT29). Filtering and analysis of data identified three oncogenic pathways interfered by 5-ASA: MAPK/ERK pathway, cell adhesion and ??-catenin/Wnt signaling. PAK1 emerged as a consensus target of 5-ASA, orchestrating these pathways. We further investigated the effect of 5-ASA on cell adhesion. 5-ASA increased cell adhesion which was measured by cell adhesion assay and transcellular-resistance measurement. Moreover, 5-ASA treatment restored membranous expression of adhesion molecules E-cadherin and ??-catenin. Role of PAK1 as a mediator of mesalamine activity was validated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PAK1 by RNA interference also increased cell adhesion. PAK1 expression was elevated in APCmin polyps and 5-ASA treatment reduced its expression. Our data demonstrates novel pharmacological mechanism of mesalamine in modulation of cell adhesion and role of PAK1 in APCmin polyposis. We propose that inhibition of PAK1 expression by 5-ASA can impede with neoplastic progression in colorectal carcinogenesis. The mechanism of PAK1 inhibition and induction of membranous translocation of adhesion proteins by 5-ASA might be independent of its known anti-inflammatory action. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>George, Margaret D</author><author>Wine, Robert N</author><author>Lackford, Brad</author><author>Kissling, Grace E</author><author>Akiyama, Steven K</author><author>Olden, Kenneth</author><author>Roberts, John D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase interacts with vinculin at focal adhesions during fatty acid-stimulated cell adhesion.</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire</full-title></periodical><pages>404-418</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Arachidonic Acid</keyword><keyword>Arachidonic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>CD29</keyword><keyword>CD29: genetics</keyword><keyword>CD29: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV: genetics</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Vinculin</keyword><keyword>Vinculin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Vinculin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24219282</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/bcb-2013-0013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3935246&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Arachidonic acid stimulates cell adhesion by activating α2β1 integrins in a process that depends on protein kinases, including p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. Here, we describe the interaction of cytoskeletal components with key signaling molecules that contribute to the spreading of, and morphological changes in, arachidonic acid-treated MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells. Arachidonic acid-treated cells showed increased attachment and spreading on collagen type IV, as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Fatty acid-treated cells displayed short cortical actin filaments associated with an increased number of β1 integrin-containing pseudopodia, whereas untreated cells displayed elongated stress fibers and fewer clusters of β1 integrins. Confocal microscopy of arachidonic acid-treated cells showed that vinculin and phospho-p38 both appeared enriched in pseudopodia and at the tips of actin filaments, and fluorescence ratio imaging indicated the increase was specific for the phospho-(active) form of p38. Immunoprecipitates of phospho-p38 from extracts of arachidonic acid-treated cells contained vinculin, and GST-vinculin fusion proteins carrying the central region of vinculin bound phospho-p38, whereas fusion proteins expressing the terminal portions of vinculin did not. These data suggest that phospho-p38 associates with particular domains on critical focal adhesion proteins that are involved in tumor cell adhesion and spreading, and that this association can be regulated by factors in the tumor microenvironment.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moshnikova, Anna</author><author>Moshnikova, Valentina</author><author>Andreev, Oleg A</author><author>Reshetnyak, Yana K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antiproliferative effect of pHLIP-amanitin</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1171-1178</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1520-4995 (Electronic)\r0006-2960 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23360641</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi301647y</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Toxins could be effective anticancer drugs, if their selective delivery into cancer cells could be achieved. We have shown that the energy of membrane-associated folding of water-soluble membrane peptides of the pHLIP (pH low insertion peptide) family could be used to move cell-impermeable cargo across the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Here we present the results of a study of pHLIP-mediated cellular delivery of a polar cell-impermeable toxin, α-amanitin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. We show that pHLIP can deliver α-amanitin into cells in a pH-dependent fashion and induce cell death within 48 h. Translocation capability could be tuned by conjugating amanitin to the C-terminus of pHLIP via linkers of different hydrophobicities that could be cleaved in the cytoplasm. pHLIP-SPDP-amanitin, which exhibits 4-5 times higher antiproliferative ability at pH 6 than at pH 7.4, was selected as the best construct. The major mechanism of amanitin delivery is direct translocation (flip) across a membrane by pHLIP and cleavage of the S-S bond in the cytoplasm. The antiproliferative effect was monitored on four different human cancer cell lines. pHLIP-mediated cytoplasmic delivery of amanitin could create great opportunities to use the toxin as a potent pH-selective anticancer agent, which predominantly targets highly proliferative cancer cells at low extracellular pH values.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bennet, Devasier</author><author>Kang, Se Chan</author><author>Gang, Jongback</author><author>Kim, Sanghyo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Photoprotective effects of apple peel nanoparticles</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Nanomedicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Nanomedicine</full-title></periodical><pages>93-108</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antioxidant</keyword><keyword>Apple peel ethanolic extract</keyword><keyword>Cellular uptake</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Light-induced damage</keyword><keyword>Phyto-drugs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24379668</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/IJN.S54048</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Plants contain enriched bioactive molecules that can protect against skin diseases. Bioactive molecules become unstable and ineffective due to unfavorable conditions. In the present study, to improve the therapeutic efficacy of phytodrugs and enhance photoprotective capability, we used poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) as a carrier of apple peel ethanolic extract (APETE) on permeation-enhanced nanoparticles (nano-APETE). The in vitro toxicity of nano-APETE-treated dermal fibroblast cells were studied in a bioimpedance system, and the results coincided with the viability assay. In addition, the continuous real-time evaluations of photodamage and photoprotective effect of nano-APETE on cells were studied. Among three different preparations of nano-APETE, the lowest concentration provided small, spherical, monodispersed, uniform particles which show high encapsulation, enhanced uptake, effective scavenging, and sustained intracellular delivery. Also, the nano-APETE is more flexible, allowing it to permeate through skin lipid membrane and release the drug in a sustained manner, thus confirming its ability as a sustained transdermal delivery. In summary, 50 μM nano-APETE shows strong synergistic photoprotective effects, thus demonstrating its higher activity on target sites for the treatment of skin damage, and would be of broad interest in the field of skin therapeutics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ando, Koji</author><author>Fukuhara, Shigetomo</author><author>Moriya, Takahiro</author><author>Obara, Yutaro</author><author>Nakahata, Norimichi</author><author>Mochizuki, Naoki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rap1 potentiates endothelial cell junctions by spatially controlling myosin I activity and actin organization</title><secondary-title>The Journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>901-916</pages><volume>202</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoenzyme Techniques</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myosin Type II</keyword><keyword>Myosin Type II: genetics</keyword><keyword>Myosin Type II: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myotonin-Protein Kinase</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins: antagonists &amp; inhibitor</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: antagonists &amp; inhibitor</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24019534</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.201301115</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3776352&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function;ECIS Modeling</label><abstract>Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is responsible for dynamic regulation of endothelial cell (EC) barrier function. Circumferential actin bundles (CAB) promote formation of linear adherens junctions (AJs) and tightening of EC junctions, whereas formation of radial stress fibers (RSF) connected to punctate AJs occurs during junction remodeling. The small GTPase Rap1 induces CAB formation to potentiate EC junctions; however, the mechanism underlying Rap1-induced CAB formation remains unknown. Here, we show that myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding kinase (MRCK)-mediated activation of non-muscle myosin II (NM-II) at cell-cell contacts is essential for Rap1-induced CAB formation. Our data suggest that Rap1 induces FGD5-dependent Cdc42 activation at cell-cell junctions to locally activate the NM-II through MRCK, thereby inducing CAB formation. We further reveal that Rap1 suppresses the NM-II activity stimulated by the Rho-ROCK pathway, leading to dissolution of RSF. These findings imply that Rap1 potentiates EC junctions by spatially controlling NM-II activity through activation of the Cdc42-MRCK pathway and suppression of the Rho-ROCK pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doeppler, Heike R</author><author>Bastea, Ligia I</author><author>Lewis-Tuffin, Laura J</author><author>Anastasiadis, Panos Z</author><author>Storz, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein Kinase D1 mediated phosphorylations regulate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) localization and cell migration.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23846685</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M113.474676</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846685</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Enabled/Vasodilator-stimulated phospho-protein (Ena/VASP) protein family members link actin dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.

Here we identify VASP as a novel substrate for Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). We show that PKD1 directly phosphorylates VASP at two serine residues, S157 and S322. These phosphorylations occur in response to RhoA activation and mediate VASP re-localization from focal contacts to the leading edge region.

TNF-α is the major pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by macrophages during IBD. Here, a mannosylated bioreducible cationic polymer (PPM) was synthesized and further spontaneously assembled nanoparticles (NPs) assisted by sodium triphosphate (TPP). The TPP-PPM/siRNA NPs exhibited high uniformity (polydispersity index=0.004), a small particle size (211-275nm), excellent bioreducibility, and enhanced cellular uptake. Additionally, the generated NPs had negative cytotoxicity compared to control NPs fabricated by branched polyethylenimine (bPEI, 25kDa) or Oligofectamine (OF) and siRNA. Invitro gene silencing experiments revealed that TPP-PPM/TNF-α siRNA NPs with a weight ratio of 40:1 showed the most efficient inhibition of the expression and secretion of TNF-α (approximately 69.9%, which was comparable to the 71.4% obtained using OF/siRNA NPs), and its RNAi efficiency was highly inhibited in the presence of mannose (20m. m). Finally, TPP-PPM/siRNA NPs showed potential therapeutic effects on colitis tissues, remarkably reducing TNF-α level. Collectively, these results suggest that non-toxic TPP-PPM/siRNA NPs can be exploited as efficient, macrophage-targeted carriers for IBD therapy. © 2013.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zehendner, Christoph M</author><author>Librizzi, Laura</author><author>Hedrich, Jana</author><author>Bauer, Nina M</author><author>Angamo, Eskedar a.</author><author>de Curtis, Marco</author><author>Luhmann, Heiko J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Moderate Hypoxia Followed by Reoxygenation Results in Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown via Oxidative Stress-Dependent Tight-Junction Protein Disruption</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e82823</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0082823</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082823</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foster, Rebecca R</author><author>Armstrong, Lynne</author><author>Baker, Siân</author><author>Wong, Dickson W.L.</author><author>Wylie, Emma C</author><author>Ramnath, Raina</author><author>Jenkins, Robert</author><author>Singh, Anurag</author><author>Steadman, Robert</author><author>Welsh, Gavin I</author><author>Mathieson, Peter W</author><author>Satchell, Simon C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glycosaminoglycan Regulation by VEGFA and VEGFC of the Glomerular Microvascular Endothelial Cell Glycocalyx in Vitro</title><secondary-title>The American Journal of Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American Journal of Pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>604-616</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23770346</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.04.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002944013003386</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Damage to endothelial glycocalyx impairs vascular barrier function and may contribute to progression of chronic vascular disease. An early indicator is microalbuminuria resulting from glomerular filtration barrier damage. We investigated the contributions of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) to glomerular microvascular endothelial cell (GEnC) glycocalyx and examined whether these are modified by vascular endothelial growth factors A and C (VEGFA and VEGFC). HA and CS were imaged on GEnCs and their resynthesis was examined. The effect of HA and CS on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and labeled albumin flux across monolayers was assessed. Effects of VEGFA and VEGFC on production and charge characteristics of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) were examined via metabolic labeling and liquid chromatography. GAG shedding was quantified using Alcian Blue. NDST2 expression was examined using real-time PCR. GEnCs expressed HA and CS in the glycocalyx. CS contributed to the barrier to both ion (TEER) and protein flux across the monolayer; HA had only a limited effect. VEGFC promoted HA synthesis and increased the charge density of synthesized GAGs. In contrast, VEGFA induced shedding of charged GAGs. CS plays a role in restriction of macromolecular flux across GEnC monolayers, and VEGFA and VEGFC differentially regulate synthesis, charge, and shedding of GAGs in GEnCs. These observations have important implications for endothelial barrier regulation in glomerular and other microvascular beds. © 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Konya, Viktoria</author><author>Üllen, Andreas</author><author>Kampitsch, Nora</author><author>Theiler, Anna</author><author>Philipose, Sonia</author><author>Parzmair, Gerald P</author><author>Marsche, Gunther</author><author>Peskar, Bernhard A</author><author>Schuligoi, Rufina</author><author>Sattler, Wolfgang</author><author>Heinemann, Akos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial E-type prostanoid 4 receptors promote barrier function and inhibit neutrophil trafficking.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>532</pages><volume>131</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dinoprostone</keyword><keyword>Dinoprostone: metabolism</keyword><keyword>EP4 Subtype</keyword><keyword>EP4 Subtype: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: immunology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Lung: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Methyl Ethers</keyword><keyword>Methyl Ethers: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: immunology</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: immunology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phenylbutyrates</keyword><keyword>Phenylbutyrates: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Prostaglandin E</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: immunology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: physiology</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>22704539</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaci.2012.05.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704539</url></web-urls></urls><label>Wound Healing</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Increased vascular permeability is a fundamental characteristic of inflammation. Substances that are released during inflammation, such as prostaglandin (PG) E(2), can counteract vascular leakage, thereby hampering tissue damage. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the role of PGE(2) and its receptors in the barrier function of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and in neutrophil trafficking. METHODS: Endothelial barrier function was determined based on electrical impedance measurements. Neutrophil recruitment was assessed based on adhesion and transendothelial migration. Morphologic alterations are shown by using immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: We observed that activation of E-type prostanoid (EP) 4 receptor by PGE(2) or an EP4-selective agonist (ONO AE1-329) enhanced the barrier function of human microvascular lung endothelial cells. EP4 receptor activation prompted similar responses in pulmonary artery and coronary artery endothelial cells. These effects were reversed by an EP4 antagonist (ONO AE3-208), as well as by blocking actin polymerization with cytochalasin B. The EP4 receptor-induced increase in barrier function was independent of the classical cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling machinery, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and Rac1. Most importantly, EP4 receptor stimulation showed potent anti-inflammatory activities by (1) facilitating wound healing of pulmonary microvascular endothelial monolayers, (2) preventing junctional and cytoskeletal reorganization of activated endothelial cells, and (3) impairing neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. The latter effects could be partially attributed to reduced E-selectin expression after EP4 receptor stimulation. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that EP4 agonists as anti-inflammatory agents represent a potential therapy for diseases with increased vascular permeability and neutrophil extravasation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nikolic, Iva</author><author>Dudvarski Stankovic, Nevenka</author><author>Bicker, Frank</author><author>Meister, Jeannette</author><author>Braun, Helene</author><author>Awwad, Khader</author><author>Baumgart, Jan</author><author>Simon, Kirsten</author><author>Thal, Serge C</author><author>Patra, Chinmoy</author><author>Harter, Patrick N</author><author>Plate, Karl H</author><author>Engel, Felix B</author><author>Dimmeler, Stefanie</author><author>Eble, Johannes A</author><author>Mittelbronn, Michel</author><author>Schäfer, Michael K</author><author>Jungblut, Benno</author><author>Chavakis, Emmanouil</author><author>Fleming, Ingrid</author><author>Schmidt, Mirko H H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EGFL7 ligates αvβ3 integrin to enhance vessel formation.</title><secondary-title>Blood</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Blood</full-title></periodical><pages>3041-3050</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23386126</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1182/blood-2011-11-394882</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23386126</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Angiogenesis, defined as blood vessel formation from a preexisting vasculature, is governed by multiple signal cascades including integrin receptors, in particular integrin α(v)β(3). Here we identify the endothelial cell (EC)-secreted factor epidermal growth factor-like protein 7 (EGFL7) as a novel specific ligand of integrin α(v)β(3) thus providing mechanistic insight into its proangiogenic actions in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, EGFL7 attaches to the ECM and by its interaction with integrin α(v)β(3) increases the motility of EC, which allows EC to move on a sticky underground during vessel remodeling. We provide evidence that the deregulation of EGFL7 in zebrafish embryos leads to a severe integrin-dependent malformation of the caudal venous plexus (CVP), pointing towards the significance of EGFL7 in vessel development. In biopsies of patients with neurological diseases, vascular EGFL7 expression rose with increasing EC proliferation. Further, EGFL7 became upregulated in vessels of the stroke penumbra using a mouse model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our data suggest that EGFL7 expression depends on the remodeling state of the existing vasculature rather than on the phenotype of neurological disease analyzed. In sum, our work sheds a novel light on the molecular mechanism EGFL7 engages to govern physiological and pathological angiogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, Zhanglong</author><author>Pati, Shibani</author><author>Potter, Daniel</author><author>Brown, Ryan</author><author>Holcomb, John B</author><author>Grill, Raymond</author><author>Wataha, Kathryn</author><author>Park, Pyong Woo</author><author>Xue, Hasen</author><author>Kozar, Rosemary A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fresh frozen plasma lessens pulmonary endothelial inflammation and hyperpermeability after hemorrhagic shock and is associated with loss of syndecan 1.</title><secondary-title>Shock (Augusta, Ga.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Shock (Augusta, Ga.)</full-title></periodical><pages>195-202</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhagic</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhagic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhagic: therapy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Plasma</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia: therapy</keyword><keyword>Shock</keyword><keyword>Syndecan-1</keyword><keyword>Syndecan-1: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23807246</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SHK.0b013e31829f91fc</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3764452&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We have recently demonstrated that injured patients in hemorrhagic shock shed syndecan 1 and that the early use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in these patients is correlated with improved clinical outcomes. As the lungs are frequently injured after trauma, we hypothesized that hemorrhagic shock-induced shedding of syndecan 1 exposes the underlying pulmonary vascular endothelium to injury resulting in inflammation and hyperpermeability and that these effects would be mitigated by FFP. In vitro, pulmonary endothelial permeability, endothelial monolayer flux, transendothelial electrical resistance, and leukocyte-endothelial binding were measured in pulmonary endothelial cells after incubation with equal volumes of FFP or lactated Ringer's (LR). In vivo, using a coagulopathic mouse model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock, pulmonary hyperpermeability, neutrophil infiltration, and syndecan 1 expression and systemic shedding were assessed after 3 h of resuscitation with either 1× FFP or 3× LR and compared with shock alone and shams. In vitro, endothelial permeability and flux were decreased, transendothelial electrical resistance was increased, and leukocyte-endothelial binding was inhibited by FFP compared with LR-treated endothelial cells. In vivo, hemorrhagic shock was associated with systemic shedding of syndecan 1, which correlated with decreased pulmonary syndecan 1 and increased pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability and inflammation. Fresh frozen plasma resuscitation, compared with LR resuscitation, abrogated these injurious effects. After hemorrhagic shock, FFP resuscitation inhibits endothelial cell hyperpermeability and inflammation and restores pulmonary syndecan 1 expression. Modulation of pulmonary syndecan 1 expression may mechanistically contribute to the beneficial effects FFP.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen-Gipson, Diane S</author><author>Zimmerman, Matthew C</author><author>Zhang, Hui</author><author>Castellanos, Glenda</author><author>O'Malley, Jennifer K</author><author>Alvarez-Ramirez, Horacio</author><author>Kharbanda, Kusum</author><author>Sisson, Joseph H</author><author>Wyatt, Todd A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Smoke extract impairs adenosine wound healing: implications of smoke-generated reactive oxygen species.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>665-673</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetylcysteine</keyword><keyword>Acetylcysteine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine</keyword><keyword>Adenosine A2A</keyword><keyword>Adenosine A2A: genetics</keyword><keyword>Adenosine A2A: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adenosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adenosine: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bronchi</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: pathology</keyword><keyword>Catalase</keyword><keyword>Catalase: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Free Radical Scavengers</keyword><keyword>Free Radical Scavengers: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Glutathione</keyword><keyword>Glutathione: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Primary Cell Culture</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Second Messenger Systems</keyword><keyword>Smoke</keyword><keyword>Tobacco</keyword><keyword>Tobacco: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23371060</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2011-0273OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23371060</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Adenosine concentrations are elevated in the lungs of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where it balances between tissue repair and excessive airway remodeling. We previously demonstrated that the activation of the adenosine A2A receptor promotes epithelial wound closure. However, the mechanism by which adenosine-mediated wound healing occurs after cigarette smoke exposure has not been investigated. The present study investigates whether cigarette smoke exposure alters adenosine-mediated reparative properties via its ability to induce a shift in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Using an in vitro wounding model, bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 5% cigarette smoke extract, were wounded, and were then stimulated with either 10 μM adenosine or the specific A2A receptor agonist, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamido-adenosine (CPCA; 10 μM), and assessed for wound closure. In a subset of experiments, bronchial epithelial cells were infected with adenovirus vectors encoding human superoxide dismutase and/or catalase or control vector. In the presence of 5% smoke extract, significant delay was evident in both adenosine-mediated and CPCA-mediated wound closure. However, cells pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a nonspecific antioxidant, reversed smoke extract-mediated inhibition. We found that cells overexpressing mitochondrial catalase repealed the smoke extract inhibition of CPCA-stimulated wound closure, whereas superoxide dismutase overexpression exerted no effect. Kinase experiments revealed that smoke extract significantly reduced the A2A-mediated activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. However, pretreatment with NAC reversed this effect. In conclusion, our data suggest that cigarette smoke exposure impairs A2A-stimulated wound repair via a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism, thereby providing a better understanding of adenosine signaling that may direct the development of pharmacological tools for the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kása, Anita</author><author>Czikora, István</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Gergely, Pál</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein phosphatase 2A activity is required for functional adherent junctions in endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Microvascular Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microvascular Research</full-title></periodical><pages>86-94</pages><volume>89</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23721711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mvr.2013.05.003</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Reversible Ser/Thr phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and adherent junction (AJ) proteins has a critical role in the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) barrier function. We have demonstrated earlier that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity is important in EC barrier integrity. In the present work, macro- and microvascular EC were examined and we provided further evidence on the significance of PP2A in the maintenance of EC cytoskeleton and barrier function with special focus on the Bα (regulatory) subunit of PP2A. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the inhibition of PP2A results in changes in the organization of EC cytoskeleton as microtubule dissolution and actin re-arrangement were detected. Depletion of Bα regulatory subunit of PP2A had similar effect on the cytoskeleton structure of the cells. Furthermore, transendothelial electric resistance measurements demonstrated significantly slower barrier recovery of Bα depleted EC after thrombin treatment. AJ proteins, VE-cadherin and β-catenin, were detected along with Bα in pull-down assay. Also, the inhibition of PP2A (by okadaic acid or fostriecin) or depletion of Bα caused β-catenin translocation from the membrane to the cytoplasm in parallel with its phosphorylation on Ser552. In conclusion, our data suggest that the A/Bα/C holoenzyme form of PP2A is essential in EC barrier integrity both in micro- and macrovascular EC. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Profirovic, Jasmina</author><author>Strekalova, Elena</author><author>Urao, Norifumi</author><author>Krbanjevic, Aleksandar</author><author>Andreeva, Alexandra V</author><author>Varadarajan, Sudhahar</author><author>Fukai, Tohru</author><author>Hen, René</author><author>Ushio-Fukai, Masuko</author><author>Voyno-Yasenetskaya, Tatyana a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel regulator of angiogenesis in endothelial cells: 5-hydroxytriptamine 4 receptor</title><secondary-title>Angiogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Angiogenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>15-28</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>5-hydroxytriptamine 4 receptor</keyword><keyword>Angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cell migration</keyword><keyword>Hindlimb ischemia model</keyword><keyword>angiogenesis á 5-hydroxytriptamine 4</keyword><keyword>hindlimb ischemia model</keyword><keyword>jasmina profirovic and elena</keyword><keyword>migration á</keyword><keyword>receptor á endothelial cell</keyword><keyword>strekalova have contributed equally</keyword><keyword>to</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1045601292</isbn><accession-num>22903372</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10456-012-9296-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10456-012-9296-7</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor (5-HT(4)R) regulates many physiological processes, including learning and memory, cognition, and gastrointestinal motility. Little is known about its role in angiogenesis. Using mouse hindlimb ischemia model of angiogenesis, we observed a significant reduction of limb blood flow recovery 14 days after ischemia and a decrease in density of CD31-positive vessels in adductor muscles in 5-HT(4)R(-/-) mice compared to wild type littermates. Our in vitro data indicated that 5-HT(4)R endogenously expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) may promote angiogenesis. Inhibition of the receptor with 5-HT(4)R antagonist RS 39604 reduced EC capillary tube formation in the reconstituted basement membrane. Using Boyden chamber migration assay and wound healing &quot;scratch&quot; assay, we demonstrated that RS 39604 treatment significantly suppressed EC migration. Transendothelial resistance measurement and immunofluorescence analysis showed that a 5-HT(4)R agonist RS 67333 led to an increase in endothelial permeability, actin stress fiber and interendothelial gap formation. Importantly, we provided the evidence that 5-HT(4)R-regulated EC migration may be mediated by Gα13 and RhoA. Our results suggest a prominent role of 5-HT(4)R in promoting angiogenesis and identify 5-HT(4)R as a potential therapeutic target for modulating angiogenesis under pathological conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hofmann, Ute</author><author>Michaelis, Stefanie</author><author>Winckler, Thomas</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Feller, Karl-Heinz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A whole-cell biosensor as in vitro alternative to skin irritation tests.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>156-162</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell-based assay</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Heat shock protein</keyword><keyword>Lab on a Chip</keyword><keyword>Reporter gene</keyword><keyword>Time-lapse microscopy</keyword><keyword>Whole-cell biosensor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>22917920</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.075</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22917920</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956566312005179</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>This study presents the time-resolved detection of chemically induced stress upon intracellular signaling cascades by using genetically modified sensor cells based on the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. The cells were stably transfected with a HSP72-GFP reporter gene construct to create an optical sensor cell line expressing a stress-inducible reporter protein. The time- and dose-dependent performance of the sensor cells is demonstrated and discussed in comparison to a label-free impedimetric monitoring approach (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, ECIS). Moreover, a microfluidic platform was established based on μSlidesI(0,4)Luer to allow for a convenient, sterile and incubator-independent time-lapse microscopic observation of the sensor cells. Cell growth was successfully achieved in this microfluidic setup and the cellular response to a cytotoxic substance could be followed in real-time and in a non-invasive, sensitive manner. This study paves the way for the development of micro-total analysis systems that combine optical and impedimetric readouts to enable an overall quantitative characterization of changes in cell metabolism and morphology as a response to toxin exposure. By recording multiple parameters, a detailed discrimination between competing stress- or growth-related mechanisms is possible, thereby presenting an entirely new in vitro alternative to skin irritation tests.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Yutong</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author><author>Mialki, Rachel K</author><author>Wei, Jianxin</author><author>Spannhake, Ernst W</author><author>Salgia, Ravi</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation of c-Met tyrosine residue 1003 regulates c-Met intracellular trafficking and lung epithelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We have previously shown that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induced a decrease in c-Met activation via serine phosphorylation of c-Met at cell-cell contacts. Here, we demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells induced internalization of c-Met via phosphorylation at its tyrosine residue 1003. In addition, it induced epithelial barrier dysfunction as evidenced by a decrease in transepithelial resistance (TER) in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with a c-Met inhibitor (PHA-665752) or inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC)-α attenuated the LPS-mediated phosphorylation of c-Met and its internalization. LPS-induced c-Met tyrosine 1003 phosphorylation, activation of PKCα, and c-Met internalization were, however, reversed by pretreatment of cells with LPA, which increased c-Met accumulation at cell-cell contacts. Inhibition of LPS-mediated c-Met tyrosine (Y1003) phosphorylation and internalization by prior treatment with PHA-665752, inhibition of PKCα, or overexpression of c-MetY1003A mutant attenuated LPS-induced reduction of TER. Furthermore, we found that c-Met accumulation at cell-cell contacts contributed to LPA-enhanced epithelial barrier integrity, since downregulation of c-Met by specific small-interfering RNA attenuated LPA-increased TER. The data reveal a novel biological function of c-Met in the regulation of lung epithelial barrier integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Fei</author><author>Nordin, Anis N</author><author>Li, Fang</author><author>Voiculescu, Ioana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Sensitive Multiparametric Biosensor With Capabilities of Rapid Toxicity Detection of Drinking Water</title><secondary-title>Volume 10: Micro- and Nano-Systems Engineering and Packaging</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Volume 10: Micro- and Nano-Systems Engineering and Packaging</full-title></periodical><pages>V010T11A001</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>ASME</publisher><isbn>978-0-7918-5639-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1115/IMECE2013-62281</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1115/IMECE2013-62281</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recently, there has been interest to develop biosensors based on live mammalian cells to monitor the toxicity of water. The cell viability after exposure to toxic water can be monitored by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) of the cell membrane. However, these impedance based toxicity sensors can only provide one single sensing endpoint (impedance measurement), and many toxicants cannot be detected at the concentration between Military Exposure Guideline levels and estimated Human Lethal Concentrations. The goal of this paper is to provide a rapid and sensitive sensing platform for long-term water toxicity detection. In this paper a novel multiparametric biosensor with integrated microfluidic channels for water toxicity detection is presented. Toxicity tests to study bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) responsiveness to health-threatening concentrations of ammonia in de-ionized (DI) water will be presented. We demonstrated the BAECs can rapidly respond to ammonia concentrations between the military exposure guideline of 2mM and human lethal concentration of 55mM. The successful testing of water toxicity by simultaneous gravimetric and impedimetric measurements indicates that the multiparametric biosensor platform is able to perform rapid and sensitive detection of water toxicity and minimize the false-positive rate.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, S</author><author>Huang, W.-C.</author><author>Zhang, L</author><author>Zhang, C</author><author>Lowery, F J</author><author>Ding, Z</author><author>Guo, H</author><author>Wang, H</author><author>Huang, S</author><author>Sahin, A A</author><author>Aldape, K D</author><author>Steeg, P S</author><author>Yu, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Src Family Kinases as Novel Therapeutic Targets to Treat Breast Cancer Brain Metastases</title><secondary-title>Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>5764-5774</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1803</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1803</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Tracey a</author><author>Lane, Jane</author><author>Ozupek, Hulya</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Claudin-20 promotes an aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Tissue barriers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tissue barriers</full-title></periodical><pages>e26518</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>abbreviations</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>claudin-20</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>electric cell impedence sensing</keyword><keyword>emp-1</keyword><keyword>epithelial</keyword><keyword>hepatocyte growth factor</keyword><keyword>hgf</keyword><keyword>membrane protein-1</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>nottingham prognostic indicator</keyword><keyword>npi</keyword><keyword>paracellular permeability</keyword><keyword>pcp</keyword><keyword>survival</keyword><keyword>ter</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword><keyword>tj</keyword><keyword>tmp</keyword><keyword>tnm</keyword><keyword>transepithelial resistance</keyword><keyword>tumour nodal</keyword><keyword>tumour-associated membrane protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24665404</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/tisb.26518</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3866195&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Claudin-20 is a member of the Claudin family of transmembrane proteins located in the tight junction (TJ) of cells of epithelial origin. Due to the increasing evidence supporting the role of TJ proteins in preventing tumor cell metastatic behavior, this study sought to evaluate the distribution of Claudin-20 in human breast cancer and the effect of Claudin-20 overexpression in human breast cancer cells. Q-PCR data from breast cancer primary tumors (n = 114) and matched background tissue (n = 30) showed that high claudin-20 expression was correlated with poor survival of patients with breast cancer (p = 0.022). Following transformation of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 with a Claudin-20 expression construct functional assays were performed to ascertain changes in cell behavior. Claudin-20 transformed cells showed significantly increased invasion (p &lt; 0.005) and were significantly less adhesive than wild type cells (p &lt; 0.05). There was no effect on growth (either in vitro or in vivo) for either cell line. Overexpression of Claudin-20 resulted in reduced transepithelial resistance (induced by the motogen HGF at 25 ng/ml, p = 0.0007). Interestingly, this was not mirrored by paracellular permeability, as overexpression of Claudin-20 caused a decrease in permeability. The introduction of Claudin-20 into human breast cancer cells resulted in breast cancer cells with an aggressive phenotype and reduced trans-epithelial resistance. There was no corresponding decrease in paracellular permeability, indicating that this Claudin has a differential function in epithelial TJ. This provides further insight into the importance of correctly functioning TJ in preventing the progression of human breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mohammad, Ghulam</author><author>Siddiquei, Mohammad Mairaj</author><author>Othman, Amira</author><author>Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed</author><author>Abu El-Asrar, Ahmed M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-mobility group box-1 protein activates inflammatory signaling pathway components and disrupts retinal vascular-barrier in the diabetic retina.</title><secondary-title>Experimental eye research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental eye research</full-title></periodical><pages>101-109</pages><volume>107</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents</keyword><keyword>Anti-Inflammatory Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Retinal Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Retinal Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy: pathology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Experimental</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Experimental: pathology</keyword><keyword>Glycyrrhizic Acid</keyword><keyword>Glycyrrhizic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein: physiology</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Immunologic</keyword><keyword>Immunologic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intravitreal Injections</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Occludin</keyword><keyword>Occludin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><accession-num>23261684</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2012.12.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (High-mobility group box-1 protein activates inflammatory signaling pathway components and disrupts retinal vascular-barrier in the diabetic retina. - Mohammad, Ghulam; Siddiquei, Mohammad Mairaj; Othman, Amira; Al-Shabrawey, Mohamed; Abu El-Asrar, Ahmed M)

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of HMGB-1 signaling pathway components in the retinas of diabetic rats and to examine the effect of intravitreal administration of HMGB-1 on the retinas of rats. The retinas of diabetic and intravitreally injected HMGB-1 rats were studied using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of HMGB-1 on retinal endothelial cell barrier function was evaluated using electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS). Diabetes induced significant upregulation of the expression of HMGB-1, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), ERK(1/2) and nuclear transcription factor Kappa B (NF-κB), whereas the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and occludin was significantly downregulated. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed significant increase in interaction between HMGB-1 and RAGE. HMGB-1 reduced transendothelial electrical resistance of bovine retinal endothelial cells. Intravitreal administration of HMGB-1 to normal rats induced significant upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), HMGB-1, RAGE, ERK(1/2), and NF-κB, and significantly increased retinal vascular permeability, whereas the expression of TLR2 and occludin was downregulated. Oral administration of glycyrrhizin, a specific inhibitor of HMGB-1, attenuated diabetes-induced upregulation of HMGB-1 expression, NF-κB activation and downregulation of occludin expression. Our findings provide evidence that in the diabetic retina, HMGB-1 possibly interacts with RAGE and activates ERK(1/2) and NF-κB to generate an inflammatory response and disrupt retinal vascular barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tran, Trong Binh</author><author>Nguyen, Phuong Diem</author><author>Um, Soong Ho</author><author>Son, Sang Jun</author><author>Min, Junhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time Monitoring In Vitro Cellular Cytotoxicity of Silica Nanotubes Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>286-290</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1166/jbn.2013.1500</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=1550-7033&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=286</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szulcek, Robert</author><author>Beckers, Cora M L</author><author>Hodzic, Jasmina</author><author>de Wit, Jelle</author><author>Chen, Zhenlong</author><author>Grob, Tim</author><author>Musters, Rene J P</author><author>Minshall, Richard D</author><author>van Hinsbergh, Victor W M</author><author>van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Localized RhoA GTPase activity regulates dynamics of endothelial monolayer integrity.</title><secondary-title>Cardiovascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cardiovascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>471-482</pages><volume>99</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Wistar</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1755-3245 (Electronic) 0008-6363 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23536606</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cvr/cvt075</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536606</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>AIMS: Endothelial cells (ECs) control vascular permeability by forming a monolayer that is sealed by extracellular junctions. Various mediators modulate the endothelial barrier by acting on junctional protein complexes and the therewith connected F-actin cytoskeleton. Different Rho GTPases participate in this modulation, but their mechanisms are still partly resolved. Here, we aimed to elucidate whether the opening and closure of the endothelial barrier are associated with distinct localized RhoA activities at the subcellular level.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Live fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy revealed spatially distinct RhoA activities associated with different aspects of the regulation of endothelial monolayer integrity. Unstimulated ECs were characterized by hotspots of RhoA activity at their periphery. Thrombin receptor activation in the femoral vein of male wistar rats and in cultured ECs enhanced RhoA activity at membrane protrusions, followed by a more sustained RhoA activity associated with cytoplasmic F-actin filaments, where prolonged RhoA activity coincided with cellular contractility. Unexpectedly, thrombin-induced peripheral RhoA hotspots were not spatially correlated to the formation of large inter-endothelial gaps. Rather, spontaneous RhoA activity at membrane protrusions coincided with the closure of inter-endothelial gaps. Electrical impedance measurements showed that RhoA signalling is essential for this protrusive activity and maintenance of barrier restoration.\n\nCONCLUSION: Spontaneous RhoA activity at membrane protrusions is spatially associated with closure, but not formation of inter-endothelial gaps, whereas RhoA activity at distant contractile filaments contributes to thrombin-induced disruption of junctional integrity. Thus, these data indicate that distinct RhoA activities are associated with disruption and re-annealing of endothelial junctions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Kreuk, Bart-Jan</author><author>Schaefer, Antje</author><author>Anthony, Eloise C</author><author>Tol, Simon</author><author>Fernandez-Borja, Mar</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>Pool, Jos</author><author>Hambach, Lothar</author><author>Goulmy, Els</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The human minor Histocompatibility Antigen1 is a RhoGAP.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e73962</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24086303</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0073962</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3781157&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The human minor Histocompatibility Antigen HMHA-1 is a major target of immune responses after allogeneic stem cell transplantation applied for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. The restriction of its expression to hematopoietic cells and many solid tumors raised questions regarding its cellular functions. Sequence analysis of the HMHA-1 encoding HMHA1 protein revealed the presence of a possible C-terminal RhoGTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain and an N-terminal BAR domain. Rho-family GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and control cell spreading and migration. RhoGTPase activity is under tight control as aberrant signaling can lead to pathology, including inflammation and cancer. Whereas Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) mediate the exchange of GDP for GTP resulting in RhoGTPase activation, GAPs catalyze the low intrinsic GTPase activity of active RhoGTPases, resulting in inactivation. Here we identify the HMHA1 protein as a novel RhoGAP. We show that HMHA1 constructs, lacking the N-terminal region, negatively regulate the actin cytoskeleton as well as cell spreading. Furthermore, we show that HMHA1 regulates RhoGTPase activity in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the HMHA1 N-terminal BAR domain is auto-inhibitory as HMHA1 mutants lacking this region, but not full-length HMHA1, showed GAP activity towards RhoGTPases. In conclusion, this study shows that HMHA1 acts as a RhoGAP to regulate GTPase activity, cytoskeletal remodeling and cell spreading, which are crucial functions in normal hematopoietic and cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klamer, Sofieke E</author><author>Kuijk, Carlijn G M</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>van der Schoot, C Ellen</author><author>von Lindern, Marieke</author><author>van Hennik, Paula B</author><author>Voermans, Carlijn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BIGH3 modulates adhesion and migration of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.</title><secondary-title>Cell adhesion &amp; migration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell adhesion &amp; migration</full-title></periodical><pages>434-449</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>abbreviations</keyword><keyword>adhesion</keyword><keyword>big</keyword><keyword>bigh3</keyword><keyword>bigh3-transduced</keyword><keyword>bm</keyword><keyword>bone marrow</keyword><keyword>bovine serum albumine</keyword><keyword>bsa</keyword><keyword>cxc-ligand 12</keyword><keyword>cxc-receptor 4</keyword><keyword>cxcl12</keyword><keyword>cxcr4</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>ecm</keyword><keyword>electric electrical cell-substrate impedance</keyword><keyword>empty-vector-transduced</keyword><keyword>erk</keyword><keyword>ev</keyword><keyword>extracellular</keyword><keyword>extracellular regulated kinase</keyword><keyword>facs</keyword><keyword>flow cytometry activated cell</keyword><keyword>hematopoiesis</keyword><keyword>hspc</keyword><keyword>integrins</keyword><keyword>matrix molecules</keyword><keyword>migration</keyword><keyword>rac1</keyword><keyword>sensing</keyword><keyword>sorting</keyword><keyword>tgf-beta induced gene h3</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24152593</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/cam.26596</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3903689&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cell adhesion and migration are important determinants of homing and development of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in bone marrow (BM) niches. The extracellular matrix protein transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inducible gene H3 (BIGH3) is involved in adhesion and migration, although the effect of BIGH3 is highly cell type-dependent. BIGH3 is abundantly expressed by mesenchymal stromal cells, while its expression in HSPCs is relatively low unless induced by certain BM stressors. Here, we set out to determine how BIGH3 modulates HSPC adhesion and migration. We show that primary HSPCs adhere to BIGH3-coated substrates, which is, in part, integrin-dependent. Overexpression of BIGH3 in HSPCs and HL60 cells reduced the adhesion to the substrate fibronectin in adhesion assays, which was even more profound in electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assays. Accordingly, the CXCL12 induced migration over fibronectin-coated surface was reduced in BIGH3-expressing HSPCs. The integrin expression profile of HSPCs was not altered upon BIGH3 expression. Although expression of BIGH3 did not alter actin polymerization in response to CXCL12, it inhibited the PMA-induced activation of the small GTPase RAC1 as well as the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs). Reduced activation of ERK and RAC1 may be responsible for the inhibition of cell adhesion and migration by BIGH3 in HSPCs. Induced BIGH3 expression upon BM stress may contribute to the regulation of BM homeostasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Preety</author><author>Templin, Thomas</author><author>Grabham, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short term effects of gamma radiation on endothelial barrier function: uncoupling of PECAM-1.</title><secondary-title>Microvascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microvascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>11-20</pages><volume>86</volume><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD31</keyword><keyword>CD31: analysis</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion Molecules</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion Molecules: analysis</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cultured: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cultured: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cultured: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Gamma Rays</keyword><keyword>Gamma Rays: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: radiation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: cytology</keyword><keyword>Organoids</keyword><keyword>Organoids: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Organoids: physiology</keyword><keyword>Organoids: radiation effects</keyword><keyword>Radiation Injuries</keyword><keyword>Radiation Injuries: etiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: radiation effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23220351</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mvr.2012.11.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220351</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A limiting factor in the treatment of cancer with radiotherapy is the damage to surrounding normal tissue, particularly the vasculature. Vessel pathologies are a major feature of the side effects of radiotherapy and little is known about early events that could initiate subsequent diseases. We tested the hypothesis that gamma radiation has early damaging effects on the human endothelial barrier. Two models were used; Human Brain Microcapillary Endothelial Cells (HBMEC), and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). Endpoints included Trans-Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), barrier permeability to 10 kDa and 70 kDa tracer molecules, and the localization of F-actin, and junction proteins and the Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1). Radiation induced a rapid and transient decrease in TEER at 3 h, with effects also seen at the radiotherapy doses. This dip in resistance correlated to the transient loss of PECAM-1 in discrete areas where cells often detached from the monolayer leaving gaps. Redistribution of PECAM-1 was also seen in 3-D human tissue models. By 6 h, the remaining cells had migrated to reseal the barrier, coincident with TEER returning to control levels. Resealed monolayers contained fewer cells per unit area and their barrier function was weakened as evidenced by an increased permeability over 24 h. This is the first demonstration of a transient and rapid effect of gamma radiation on human endothelial barriers that involves cell detachment and the loss of PECAM-1. Considering the association of cell adhesion molecules with vasculopathies, such an effect has the potential to be clinically relevant to the longer-term effects of radiotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Shannon L</author><author>Wahl-Jensen, Victoria</author><author>Copeland, Anna Maria</author><author>Jahrling, Peter B</author><author>Schmaljohn, Connie S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial cell permeability during hantavirus infection involves factor XII-dependent increased activation of the kallikrein-kinin system.</title><secondary-title>PLoS pathogens</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS pathogens</full-title></periodical><pages>e1003470</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Bradykinin</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillaries</keyword><keyword>Capillaries: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillaries: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillaries: virology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Factor XII</keyword><keyword>Factor XII: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Factor XII: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hantavirus</keyword><keyword>Hantavirus Infections</keyword><keyword>Hantavirus Infections: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hantavirus Infections: virology</keyword><keyword>Hantavirus: physiology</keyword><keyword>High-Molecular-Weight</keyword><keyword>High-Molecular-Weight: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: drug effec</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: virology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kallikrein-Kinin System</keyword><keyword>Kallikrein-Kinin System: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Kininogen</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: virology</keyword><keyword>Muscle</keyword><keyword>Prekallikrein</keyword><keyword>Prekallikrein: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Prekallikrein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protease Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protease Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Proteolysis</keyword><keyword>Proteolysis: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: virology</keyword><keyword>Smooth</keyword><keyword>Surface Properties</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: virology</keyword><keyword>Virus Replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23874198</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.ppat.1003470</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Endothelial cell permeability during hantavirus infection involves factor XII-dependent increased activation of the kallikrein-kinin system. - Taylor, Shannon L; Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Copeland, Anna Maria; Jahrling, Peter B; Schmaljohn, Connie S)

Hantavirus-infected endothelial cells (EC) display no overt cytopathology; consequently, pathogenesis models have focused either on the influx of immune cells and release of cytokines or on increased degradation of the adherens junction protein, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, due to hantavirus-mediated hypersensitization of EC to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To examine endothelial leakage in a relevant in vitro system, we co-cultured endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) to generate capillary blood vessel-like structures. In contrast to results obtained in monolayers of cultured EC, we found that despite viral replication in both cell types as well as the presence of VEGF, infected in vitro vessels neither lost integrity nor displayed evidence of VE-cadherin degradation. Here, we present evidence for a novel mechanism of hantavirus-induced vascular leakage involving activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). We show that incubation of factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein (PK), and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) plasma proteins with hantavirus-infected EC results in increased cleavage of HK, higher enzymatic activities of FXIIa/kallikrein (KAL) and increased liberation of bradykinin (BK). Measuring cell permeability in real-time using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), we identified dramatic increases in endothelial cell permeability after KKS activation and liberation of BK. Furthermore, the alterations in permeability could be prevented using inhibitors that directly block BK binding, the activity of FXIIa, or the activity of KAL. Lastly, FXII binding and autoactivation is increased on the surface of hantavirus-infected EC. These data are the first to demonstrate KKS activation during hantavirus infection and could have profound implications for treatment of hantavirus infections.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whidbey, Christopher</author><author>Harrell, Maria Isabel</author><author>Burnside, Kellie</author><author>Ngo, Lisa</author><author>Becraft, Alexis K</author><author>Iyer, Lakshminarayan M</author><author>Aravind, L</author><author>Hitti, Jane</author><author>Waldorf, Kristina M Adams</author><author>Rajagopal, Lakshmi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A hemolytic pigment of Group B Streptococcus allows bacterial penetration of human placenta.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1265-1281</pages><volume>210</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Amniotic Fluid</keyword><keyword>Amniotic Fluid: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Amniotic Fluid: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endopeptidase K</keyword><keyword>Endopeptidase K: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fetus</keyword><keyword>Fetus: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fetus: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Glycolipids</keyword><keyword>Glycolipids: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infectious</keyword><keyword>Infectious: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Infectious: microbiology</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B</keyword><keyword>NF-kappa B: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Obstetric Labor</keyword><keyword>Ornithine</keyword><keyword>Ornithine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pigments</keyword><keyword>Placenta</keyword><keyword>Placenta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Placenta: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Complications</keyword><keyword>Premature</keyword><keyword>Premature: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Premature: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1540-9538 (Electronic) 0022-1007 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23712433</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1084/jem.20122753</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3674703&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Microbial infection of the amniotic fluid is a significant cause of fetal injury, preterm birth, and newborn infections. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important human bacterial pathogen associated with preterm birth, fetal injury, and neonatal mortality. Although GBS has been isolated from amniotic fluid of women in preterm labor, mechanisms of in utero infection remain unknown. Previous studies indicated that GBS are unable to invade human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs), which represent the last barrier to the amniotic cavity and fetus. We show that GBS invades hAECs and strains lacking the hemolysin repressor CovR/S accelerate amniotic barrier failure and penetrate chorioamniotic membranes in a hemolysin-dependent manner. Clinical GBS isolates obtained from women in preterm labor are hyperhemolytic and some are associated with covR/S mutations. We demonstrate for the first time that hemolytic and cytolytic activity of GBS is due to the ornithine rhamnolipid pigment and not due to a pore-forming protein toxin. Our studies emphasize the importance of the hemolytic GBS pigment in ascending infection and fetal injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinde, Arti V</author><author>Motiani, Rajender K</author><author>Zhang, Xuexin</author><author>Abdullaev, Iskandar F</author><author>Adam, Alejandro P</author><author>González-Cobos, José C</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Matrougui, Khalid</author><author>Vincent, Peter A</author><author>Trebak, Mohamed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>STIM1 controls endothelial barrier function independently of Orai1 and Ca2+ entry.</title><secondary-title>Science signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>ra18</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>267</issue><keywords><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium Channels</keyword><keyword>Calcium Channels: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic Reticulum</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic Reticulum: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: drug effec</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: genetics</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels: genetics</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23512989</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scisignal.2003425</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512989</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Endothelial barrier function is critical for tissue fluid homeostasis, and its disruption contributes to various pathologies, including inflammation and sepsis. Thrombin is an endogenous agonist that impairs endothelial barrier function. We showed that the thrombin-induced decrease in transendothelial electric resistance of cultured human endothelial cells required the endoplasmic reticulum-localized, calcium-sensing protein stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), but was independent of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane and the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel protein Orai1, which is the target of STIM1 in the store-operated calcium entry pathway. We found that STIM1 coupled the thrombin receptor to activation of the guanosine triphosphatase RhoA, stimulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation, formation of actin stress fibers, and loss of cell-cell adhesion.

Being an essential step prior to metastasis, blockage of micrometastasis can have potential applications in cancer therapy and metastasis prevention. Due to poorly known molecular mechanisms leading to micrometastasis, developing therapeutic strategies to target prostate cancer utilizing drugs that block micrometastasis is far from reality. Here, we demonstrate the potential benefits of simvastatin in the inhibition of prostate cancer micrometastasis and reveal the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process. First, we showed that simvastatin inhibited the ability of human PC3 prostate cancer cells for transendothelial migration in vitro. Second, our data indicated that simvastatin modulates the expression of tumor-derived factors such as angiopoietins and VEGF-A at the mRNA and protein levels by the PC3 cells, thus preventing endothelial-barrier disruption. Third, simvastatin directly activated endothelial cells and enhances endothelial-barrier resistance. Apart from this, our study revealed that simvastatin-mediated effect on PC3 micrometastasis was mediated through inhibition of integrin αv β3 activity and suppression of interaction between prostate cancer cell integrin αv β3 with endothelial ICAM-1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaer, C A</author><author>Deuel, J W</author><author>Bittermann, A G</author><author>Rubio, I G</author><author>Schoedon, G</author><author>Spahn, D R</author><author>Wepf, R A</author><author>Vallelian, F</author><author>Schaer, D J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of haptoglobin protection against hemoglobin peroxidation triggered endothelial damage.</title><secondary-title>Cell death and differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell death and differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>1569-1579</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Haptoglobins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobins</keyword><keyword>Hemoglobins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>LDL</keyword><keyword>LDL: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lipid Peroxidation</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins</keyword><keyword>Oxidation-Reduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23995229</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/cdd.2013.113</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3792434&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) has been recognized as a disease trigger in hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease, malaria, and blood transfusion. In vivo, many of the adverse effects of free Hb can be attenuated by the Hb scavenger acute-phase protein haptoglobin (Hp). The primary physiologic disturbances that can be caused by free Hb are found within the cardiovascular system and Hb-triggered oxidative toxicity toward the endothelium has been promoted as a potential mechanism. The molecular mechanisms of this toxicity as well as of the protective activities of Hp are not yet clear. Within this study, we systematically investigated the structural, biochemical, and cell biologic nature of Hb toxicity in an endothelial cell system under peroxidative stress. We identified two principal mechanisms of oxidative Hb toxicity that are mediated by globin degradation products and by modified lipoprotein species, respectively. The two damage pathways trigger diverse and discriminative inflammatory and cytotoxic responses. Hp provides structural stabilization of Hb and shields Hb's oxidative reactions with lipoproteins, providing dramatic protection against both pathways of toxicity. By these mechanisms, Hp shifts Hb's destructive pseudo-peroxidative reaction to a potential anti-oxidative function during peroxidative stress.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Kynaston, Howard G</author><author>Ablin, Richard J</author><author>Mason, Malcolm D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4, TGaseP) enhances the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to extracellular matrix, the potential role of TGase-core domain</title><secondary-title>Journal of Translational Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Translational Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>269</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell-matrix adhesion</keyword><keyword>Electric cell sensing</keyword><keyword>Focal adhesion kinase</keyword><keyword>Integrins</keyword><keyword>Paxillin</keyword><keyword>Prostate cancer</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminase</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminase-4</keyword><keyword>cell-matrix adhesion</keyword><keyword>electric cell sensing</keyword><keyword>focal adhesion kinase</keyword><keyword>integrins</keyword><keyword>paxillin</keyword><keyword>prostate cancer</keyword><keyword>transglutaminase</keyword><keyword>transglutaminase-4</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Journal of Translational Medicine</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1479-5876-11-269</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/11/1/269</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Modeling</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adyshev, Djanybek M</author><author>Moldobaeva, Nurgul</author><author>Mapes, Brandon</author><author>Elangovan, Venkate</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNA regulation of nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase expression in human lung endothelium</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>58-66</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>Endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>MLCK</keyword><keyword>MiRNA</keyword><keyword>Ventilator-induced lung injury</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1535-4989</isbn><accession-num>23492194</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2012-0397OC</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECIS Barrier Function;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Increased lung vascular permeability, the consequence of endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction, is a cardinal feature of inflammatory conditions such as acute lung injury and sepsis and leads to lethal physiological dysfunction characterized by alveolar flooding, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. We previously demonstrated that the nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase isoform (nmMLCK) plays a key role in agonist-induced pulmonary EC barrier regulation. The present study evaluated posttranscriptional regulation of MYLK expression, the gene encoding nmMLCK, via 3' untranslated region (UTR) binding by microRNAs (miRNAs) with in silico analysis identifying hsa-miR-374a, hsa-miR-374b, hsa-miR-520c-3p, and hsa-miR-1290 as miRNA candidates. We identified increased MYLK gene transcription induced by TNF-α (24 h; 4.7 ± 0.45 fold increase [FI]), LPS (4 h; 2.85 ± 0.15 [FI]), and 18% cyclic stretch (24 h; 4.6 ± 0.24 FI) that was attenuated by transfection of human lung ECs with mimics of hsa-miR-374a, hsa-miR-374b, hsa-miR-520c-3p, or hsa-miR-1290 (20-80% reductions by each miRNA). TNF-α, LPS, and 18% cyclic stretch each increased the activity of a MYLK 3'UTR luciferase reporter (2.5-7.0 FI) with induction reduced by mimics of each miRNA (30-60% reduction). MiRNA inhibitors (antagomirs) for each MYLK miRNA significantly increased 3'UTR luciferase activity (1.2-2.3 FI) and rescued the decreased MLCK-3'UTR reporter activity produced by miRNA mimics (70-110% increases for each miRNA; P &lt; 0.05). These data demonstrate that increased human lung EC expression of MYLK by bioactive agonists (excessive mechanical stress, LPS, TNF-α) is regulated in part by specific miRNAs (hsa-miR-374a, hsa-miR-374b, hsa-miR-520c-3p, and hsa-miR-1290), representing a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing inflammatory lung injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dubrovskyi, Oleksii</author><author>Birukova, Anna A</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement of local permeability at subcellular level in cell models of agonist- and ventilator-induced lung injury.</title><secondary-title>Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>254-263</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Avidin</keyword><keyword>Avidin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Avidin: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport: physiology</keyword><keyword>Biotinylation</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Collagen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Culture Media: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: analogs &amp; derivative</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Gelatin</keyword><keyword>Gelatin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Tissue Array Analysis</keyword><keyword>Tissue Array Analysis: methods</keyword><keyword>Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury</keyword><keyword>Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury: physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23212101</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/labinvest.2012.159</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3668557&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Alterations of cell monolayer integrity and increased vascular permeability are key to many pathologies, including atherosclerosis, stroke, lung injury, cancer, digestive disorders and others. Current approaches to probe cell permeability require specific culture conditions and provide an average estimation of trans-monolayer permeability, while analysis of regional monolayer permeability in static and mechanically challenged monolayer at a single-cell scale resolution remains unavailable. We describe a novel method for visualization and rapid quantification of trans-monolayer permeability based on high-affinity interactions between ligand (FITC-conjugated avidin) added in the culture medium, which permeates cell monolayer to reach substrate-bound acceptor (biotinylated gelatin or collagen). This approach was used to simultaneously evaluate general and local permeability responses by endothelial cell (EC) monolayer to a spectrum of barrier protective and barrier disruptive agonists and their combinations. The results revealed the paracellular pathway as the predominant mechanism of agonist-induced mass transport by pulmonary EC. We also detected for the first time, in a direct assay, a synergistic effect of pathologically relevant levels of cyclic stretch (CS) and edemagenic agent thrombin in the development of pulmonary EC hyper-permeability response observed in ventilator-induced lung injury. The reported novel assay provides unique information about local monolayer permeability changes induced by agonists, mechanical factors or molecular perturbations in single cells. However, the spectrum of substrates, assay formats and experimental conditions compatible with this assay suggest its broad application in the areas of endothelial and epithelial biology, cancer research and other fields.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Usatyuk, PeterV V</author><author>Kotha, SainathR R</author><author>Parinandi, NarasimhamL L</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phospholipase D signaling mediates reactive oxygen species-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Pulmonary Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pulmonary Circulation</full-title></periodical><pages>108</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>a ubiquitous enzyme present</keyword><keyword>bacteria</keyword><keyword>cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>hydrolyzes the membrane</keyword><keyword>in fungi</keyword><keyword>lipid signaling</keyword><keyword>lung permeability</keyword><keyword>oxidants</keyword><keyword>phosphatidic acid</keyword><keyword>phospholipase d</keyword><keyword>plants and mammals</keyword><keyword>pld</keyword><keyword>reactive oxygen species</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23662182</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4103/2045-8932.109925</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3641713&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4103/2045-8932.109925</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as critical players in the pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders and diseases. Earlier, we have demonstrated that ROS stimulate lung endothelial cell (EC) phospholipase D (PLD) that generates phosphatidic acid (PA), a second messenger involved in signal transduction. In the current study, we investigated the role of PLD signaling in the ROS-induced lung vascular EC barrier dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a typical physiological ROS, induced PLD activation and altered the barrier function in bovine pulmonary artery ECs (BPAECs). 1-Butanol, the quencher of PLD, generated PA leading to the formation of physiologically inactive phosphatidyl butanol but not its biologically inactive analog, 2-butanol, blocked the H2O2-mediated barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, cell permeable C2 ceramide, an inhibitor of PLD but not the C2 dihydroceramide, attenuated the H2O2-induced PLD activation and enhancement of paracellular permeability of Evans blue conjugated albumin across the BPAEC monolayers. In addition, transfection of BPAECs with adenoviral constructs of hPLD1 and mPLD2 mutants attenuated the H2O2-induced barrier dysfunction, cytoskeletal reorganization and distribution of focal adhesion proteins. For the first time, this study demonstrated that the PLD-generated intracellular bioactive lipid signal mediator, PA, played a critical role in the ROS-induced barrier dysfunction in lung vascular ECs. This study also underscores the importance of PLD signaling in vascular leak and associated tissue injury in the etiology of lung diseases among critically ill patients encountering oxygen toxicity and excess ROS production during ventilator-assisted breathing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngok, Siu P</author><author>Geyer, Rory</author><author>Kourtidis, Antonis</author><author>Mitin, Natalia</author><author>Feathers, Ryan</author><author>Der, Channing</author><author>Anastasiadis, Panos Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TEM4 is a junctional Rho GEF required for cell-cell adhesion, monolayer integrity and barrier function.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>3271-3277</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>Pt 15</issue><keywords><keyword>catenin</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cell junction</keyword><keyword>guanine nucleotide exchange factor</keyword><keyword>rhoa</keyword><keyword>tem4</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23729734</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.123869</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23729734</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Signaling events mediated by Rho family GTPases orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics and cell junction formation. The activation of Rho GTPases is tightly regulated by guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs). In this study, we identified a novel Rho-specific GEF called TEM4 (tumor endothelial marker 4) that associates with multiple members of the cadherin-catenin complex and with several cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Depending on confluence, TEM4 localized to either actin stress fibers or areas of cell-cell contact. The junctional localization of TEM4 was independent of actin binding. Depletion of endogenous TEM4 by shRNAs impaired Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cell junctions, disrupted MDCK acini formation in 3D culture and negatively affected endothelial barrier function. Taken together, our findings implicate TEM4 as a novel and crucial junctional Rho GEF that regulates cell junction integrity and epithelial and endothelial cell function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adyshev, Djanybek M</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Moldobaeva, Nurgul</author><author>Kim, Kyung-mi</author><author>Ma, Shwu-Fan</author><author>Kasa, Anita</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins differentially regulate endothelial hyperpermeability after thrombin.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Thrombin stimulates paracellular gap and F-actin stress fiber formation, triggers actomyosin contraction, and alters EC permeability through multiple mechanisms that include protein kinase C (PKC) activation. We previously have shown that the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) actin-binding proteins differentially participate in sphingosine-1 phosphate-induced EC barrier enhancement. Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the COOH-terminus of ERM proteins causes conformational changes in ERM to unmask binding sites and is considered a hallmark of ERM activation. In the present study we test the hypothesis that ERM proteins are phosphorylated on this critical threonine residue by thrombin-induced signaling events and explore the role of the ERM family in modulating thrombin-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement and EC barrier function. Thrombin promotes ERM phosphorylation at this threonine residue (ezrin Thr567, radixin Thr564, moesin Thr558) in a PKC-dependent fashion and induces translocation of phosphorylated ERM to the EC periphery. Thrombin-induced ERM threonine phosphorylation is likely synergistically mediated by protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR2. Using the siRNA approach, depletion of either moesin alone or of all three ERM proteins significantly attenuates thrombin-induced increase in EC barrier permeability (transendothelial electrical resistance), cytoskeletal rearrangements, paracellular gap formation, and accumulation of phospho-myosin light chain. In contrast, radixin depletion exerts opposing effects on these indexes. These data suggest that ERM proteins play important differential roles in the thrombin-induced modulation of EC permeability, with moesin promoting barrier dysfunction and radixin opposing it.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dreher, Lena</author><author>Elvers-Hornung, Susanne</author><author>Brinkmann, Irena</author><author>Huck, Volker</author><author>Henschler, Reinhard</author><author>Gloe, Torsten</author><author>Klüter, Harald</author><author>Bieback, Karen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cultivation in human serum reduces adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cell adhesion to laminin and endothelium and reduces capillary entrapment.</title><secondary-title>Stem cells and development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Stem cells and development</full-title></periodical><pages>791-803</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adipose Tissue</keyword><keyword>Adipose Tissue: cytology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred NOD</keyword><keyword>Laminin</keyword><keyword>Laminin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</keyword><keyword>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>SCID</keyword><keyword>Serum</keyword><keyword>Serum: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23025550</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/scd.2012.0051</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025550</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The increasing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in clinical cellular therapy requires a safe and controlled production process compliant with Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. Pooled blood group AB human serum (HS) has been used to replace fetal bovine serum (FBS), critically rated by the regulatory agencies, since it can support the expansion of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC). However, it remains unknown whether the choice of serum affects application-relevant characteristics of ASC. A microarray-based screen has revealed differentially expressed adhesion and extracellular matrix-associated molecules in HS- and FBS-ASC. Since cell therapy relies on the cells' efficacy to home and engraft, HS- and FBS-ASC were compared by analyzing adhesion, migration, and transmigration as well as short-term homing in vivo. HS-cultivated ASC demonstrated a higher adhesion to plastic, but reduced adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules, that is, laminin, and to endothelial cells both under static and flow conditions. Migration and transmigration assays confirmed the attraction of ASC by the tumor conditioned medium irrespective of the supplement. Coinjecting differently labeled HS- and FBS-ASC into nonobese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficiency mice revealed reduced numbers of HS-ASC in lungs and liver. This has been interpreted as reduced capillary entrapment. Our data indicate that varying the serum supplement may alter application-relevant characteristics of ASC, such as adhesion, as well as lung entrapment after infusion. Appropriate injury models and further molecular analyses are required to provide mechanistic insight into the differential effects of HS versus FBS on ASC cultures.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heijink, Irene</author><author>van Oosterhout, Antoon</author><author>Kliphuis, Nathalie</author><author>Jonker, Marnix</author><author>Hoffmann, Roland</author><author>Telenga, Eef</author><author>Klooster, Karin</author><author>Slebos, Dirk-Jan</author><author>Ten Hacken, Nick</author><author>Postma, Dirkje</author><author>van den Berge, Maarten</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oxidant-induced corticosteroid unresponsiveness in human bronchial epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Thorax</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Thorax</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23980116</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203520</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23980116</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that increased oxidative stress, as present in the airways of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, induces epithelial damage and reduces epithelial responsiveness to suppressive effects of corticosteroids on proinflammatory cytokine production and barrier function. METHODS: We induced oxidative stress by H2O2 and/or cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) derived by brushings from asthma patients, COPD patients, and smoking and non-smoking control individuals. We investigated effects of budesonide on barrier function (electrical resistance) and TNF-α-induced proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-8/CXCL8, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)). RESULTS: We observed that H2O2 and CSE reduce epithelial resistance. Budesonide significantly counteracted this effect, likely by protection against epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent cell-cell contact disruption. Furthermore, budesonide suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production. H2O2 pretreatment reduced this effect of budesonide on cytokine production in both 16HBE cells and PBECs. Importantly, PBECs from asthma and COPD patients were less sensitive to budesonide with respect to cytokine production and barrier function than PBECs from control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data indicate that budesonide suppresses epithelial proinflammatory responses and barrier dysfunction and that oxidative stress reduces these effects in airway epithelium from asthma and COPD patients. Therefore, restoration of corticosteroid responsiveness in asthma and COPD may act to improve the airway epithelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walters, Shaun B</author><author>Kieckbusch, Jens</author><author>Nagalingam, Gayathri</author><author>Swain, Ashleigh</author><author>Latham, Sharissa L</author><author>Grau, Georges E R</author><author>Britton, Warwick J</author><author>Combes, Valéry</author><author>Saunders, Bernadette M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microparticles from mycobacteria-infected macrophages promote inflammation and cellular migration.</title><secondary-title>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</full-title></periodical><pages>669-677</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: immunology</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cell-Derived Microparticles</keyword><keyword>Cell-Derived Microparticles: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cell-Derived Microparticles: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Chemokines</keyword><keyword>Chemokines: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Chemokines: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: immunology</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells: immunology</keyword><keyword>Dendritic Cells: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Endosomes</keyword><keyword>Endosomes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: immunology</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes: immunology</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lymphocyte Activation</keyword><keyword>Lymphocyte Activation: immunology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: immunology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</keyword><keyword>Mycobacterium tuberculosis: immunology</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword><keyword>Tuberculosis</keyword><keyword>Tuberculosis: immunology</keyword><keyword>Tuberculosis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rab GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rab GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23241892</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4049/jimmunol.1201856</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241892</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is characterized by a strong inflammatory response whereby a few infected macrophages within the granuloma induce sustained cellular accumulation. The mechanisms coordinating this response are poorly characterized. We hypothesized that microparticles (MPs), which are submicron, plasma membrane-derived vesicles released by cells under both physiological and pathological conditions, are involved in this process. Aerosol infection of mice with M. tuberculosis increased CD45(+) MPs in the blood after 4 wk of infection, and in vitro infection of human and murine macrophages with mycobacteria enhanced MP release. MPs derived from mycobacteria-infected macrophages were proinflammatory, and when injected into uninfected mice they induced significant neutrophil, macrophage, and dendritic cell recruitment to the injection site. When incubated with naive macrophages, these MPs enhanced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release, and they aided in the disruption of the integrity of a respiratory epithelial cell monolayer, providing a mechanism for the egress of cells to the site of M. tuberculosis infection in the lung. In addition, MPs colocalized with the endocytic recycling marker Rab11a within macrophages, and this association increased when the MPs were isolated from mycobacteria-infected cells. M. tuberculosis-derived MPs also carried mycobacterial Ag and were able to activate M. tuberculosis-specific CD4(+) T cells in vivo and in vitro in a dendritic cell-dependent manner. Collectively, these data identify an unrecognized role for MPs in host response against M. tuberculosis by promoting inflammation, intercellular communication, and cell migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ke, Yunbo</author><author>Lei, Ming</author><author>Wang, Xin</author><author>Solaro, R John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unique catalytic activities and scaffolding of p21 activated kinase-1 in cardiovascular signaling.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>116</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>auto-phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular diseases</keyword><keyword>cytoskeletal re</keyword><keyword>cytoskeletal reorganization</keyword><keyword>fty720</keyword><keyword>scaffolding</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24098283</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fphar.2013.00116</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3784770&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>P21 activated kinase-1 (Pak1) has diverse functions in mammalian cells. Although a large number of phosphoproteins have been designated as Pak1 substrates from in vitro studies, emerging evidence has indicated that Pak1 may function as a signaling molecule through a unique molecular mechanism - scaffolding. By scaffolding, Pak1 delivers signals through an auto-phosphorylation-induced conformational change without transfer of a phosphate group to its immediate downstream effector(s). Here we review evidence for this regulatory mechanism based on structural and functional studies of Pak1 in different cell types and research models as well as in vitro biochemical assays. We also discuss the implications of Pak1 scaffolding in disease-related signaling processes and the potential in cardiovascular drug development.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bennet, Devasier</author><author>Kim, Sanghyo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECIS to assess human skin cell photo-oxidative damage</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials &amp; Emerging Engineering Technologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials &amp; Emerging Engineering Technologies</full-title></periodical><pages>696-701</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4799-1379-4</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICANMEET.2013.6609393</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6609393</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davidson, Bruce a</author><author>Vethanayagam, R Robert</author><author>Grimm, Melissa J</author><author>Mullan, Barbara a</author><author>Raghavendran, Krishnan</author><author>Blackwell, Timothy S</author><author>Freeman, Michael L</author><author>Ayyasamy, Vanniarajan</author><author>Singh, Keshav K</author><author>Sporn, Michael B</author><author>Itagaki, Kiyoshi</author><author>Hauser, Carl J</author><author>Knight, Paul R</author><author>Segal, Brahm H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NADPH oxidase and Nrf2 regulate gastric aspiration-induced inflammation and acute lung injury.</title><secondary-title>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</full-title></periodical><pages>1714-1724</pages><volume>190</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>129 Strain</keyword><keyword>Acute Lung Injury</keyword><keyword>Acute Lung Injury: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Acute Lung Injury: etiology</keyword><keyword>Acute Lung Injury: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: physiology</keyword><keyword>Intratracheal</keyword><keyword>Intubation</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: deficiency</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: physiology</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2: deficiency</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2: physiology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophil Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Neutrophil Infiltration: immunology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: immunology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: pathology</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23296708</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4049/jimmunol.1202410</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3563868&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Recruitment of neutrophils and release of reactive oxygen species are considered to be major pathogenic components driving acute lung injury (ALI). However, NADPH oxidase, the major source of reactive oxygen species in activated phagocytes, can paradoxically limit inflammation and injury. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase protects against ALI by limiting neutrophilic inflammation and activating Nrf2, a transcriptional factor that induces antioxidative and cytoprotective pathways. Our objective was to delineate the roles of NADPH oxidase and Nrf2 in modulating acute lung inflammation and injury in clinically relevant models of acute gastric aspiration injury, a major cause of ALI. Acid aspiration caused increased ALI (as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid albumin concentration) in both NADPH oxidase-deficient mice and Nrf2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. NADPH oxidase reduced airway neutrophil accumulation, but Nrf2 decreased ALI without affecting neutrophil recovery. Acid injury resulted in a 120-fold increase in mitochondrial DNA, a proinflammatory and injurious product of cellular necrosis, in cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Pharmacologic activation of Nrf2 by the triterpenoid 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole limited aspiration-induced ALI in wild-type mice and reduced endothelial cell injury caused by mitochondrial extract-primed human neutrophils, leading to the conclusion that NADPH oxidase and Nrf2 have coordinated, but distinct, functions in modulating inflammation and injury. These results also point to Nrf2 as a therapeutic target to limit ALI by attenuating neutrophil-induced cellular injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wijesinghe, Dayanjali</author><author>Arachchige, Mohan C M</author><author>Lu, Andrew</author><author>Reshetnyak, Yana K</author><author>Andreev, Oleg a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>pH dependent transfer of nano-pores into membrane of cancer cells to induce apoptosis</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>2-8</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>L</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep03560</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/srep03560</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fox, Elizabeth D</author><author>Heffernan, Daithi S</author><author>Cioffi, William G</author><author>Reichner, Jonathan S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neutrophils from critically ill septic patients mediate profound loss of endothelial barrier integrity.</title><secondary-title>Critical care (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical care (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>R226</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Neutriphils</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>TNF</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24099563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/cc13049</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24099563</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Barrier Function;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is characterized by systemic immune activation and neutrophil-mediated endothelial barrier integrity compromise, contributing to end-organ dysfunction. Studies evaluating endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by neutrophils from septic patients are lacking, despite its clinical significance. We hypothesized that septic neutrophils would cause characteristic patterns of endothelial barrier dysfunction, distinct from experimental stimulation of normal neutrophils, and that treatment with the immunomodulatory drug β-glucan would attenuate this effect.\n\nMETHODS: Blood was obtained from critically ill septic patients. Patients were either general surgery patients (Primary Sepsis (PS)) or those with sepsis following trauma (Secondary Sepsis (SS)). Those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were identified. Healthy volunteers served as controls. Neutrophils were purified and aliquots were untreated, or treated with fMLP or β-glucan. Endothelial cells were grown to confluence and activated with tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-α . Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) was used to determine monolayer resistance after neutrophils were added. Groups were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nRESULTS: Neutrophils from all septic patients, as well as fMLP-normal neutrophils, reduced endothelial barrier integrity to a greater extent than untreated normal neutrophils (normalized resistance of cells from septic patients at 30 mins = 0.90 ± 0.04; at 60 mins = 0.73 ± 0.6 and at 180 mins = 0.56 ± 0.05; p &lt; 0.05 vs normal). Compared to untreated PS neutrophils, fMLP-treated PS neutrophils caused further loss of barrier function at all time points; no additive effect was noted in stimulation of SS neutrophils beyond 30 min. Neutrophils from ARDS patients caused greater loss of barrier integrity than those from non-ARDS patients, despite similarities in age, sex, septic source, and neutrophil count. Neutrophils obtained after resolution of sepsis caused less barrier dysfunction at all time points. β-glucan treatment of septic patients' neutrophils attenuated barrier compromise, rendering the effect similar to that induced by neutrophils obtained once sepsis had resolved.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils from septic patients exert dramatic compromise of endothelial barrier integrity. This pattern is mimicked by experimental activation of healthy neutrophils. The effect of septic neutrophils on the endothelium depends upon the initial inflammatory event, correlates with organ dysfunction and resolution of sepsis, and is ameliorated by β-glucan.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rom, Slava</author><author>Zuluaga-Ramirez, Viviana</author><author>Dykstra, Holly</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy L</author><author>Pacher, Pal</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selective activation of cannabinoid receptor 2 in leukocytes suppresses their engagement of the brain endothelium and protects the blood-brain barrier.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>1548-1558</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin Depolymerizing Factors</keyword><keyword>Actin Depolymerizing Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: pathology</keyword><keyword>CB2</keyword><keyword>CB2: agonists</keyword><keyword>CB2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>CD29</keyword><keyword>CD29: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cannabinoid</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion Molecules</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion Molecules: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Cerebral Cortex: pathology</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: pathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha4beta1</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha4beta1: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha4beta1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1</keyword><keyword>Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1: chemistr</keyword><keyword>Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1: metaboli</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: pathology</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24055259</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.07.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3814716&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is highly expressed in immune cells and stimulation decreases inflammatory responses. We tested the idea that selective CB2 activation in human monocytes suppresses their ability to engage the brain endothelium and migrate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), preventing consequent injury. Intravital videomicroscopy was used to quantify adhesion of leukocytes to cortical vessels in lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, after injection of ex vivo CB2-activated leukocytes into mice; CB2 agonists markedly decreased adhesion of ex vivo labeled cells in vivo. In an in vitro BBB model, CB2 activation in monocytes largely attenuated adhesion to and migration across monolayers of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells and diminished BBB damage. CB2 stimulation in monocytes down-regulated active forms of integrins, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4). Cells treated with CB2 agonists exhibited increased phosphorylation levels of inhibitory sites of the actin-binding proteins cofilin and VASP, which are upstream regulators of conformational integrin changes. Up-regulated by relevant stimuli, Rac1 and RhoA were suppressed by CB2 agonists in monocytes. CB2 stimulation decreased formation of lamellipodia, which play a key role in monocyte migration. These results indicate that selective CB2 activation in leukocytes decreases key steps in monocyte-BBB engagement, thus suppressing inflammatory leukocyte responses and preventing neuroinflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pathak, Ravi Ramesh</author><author>Grover, Aditya</author><author>Malaney, Prerna</author><author>Quarni, Waise</author><author>Pandit, Ashish</author><author>Allen-Gipson, Diane</author><author>Davé, Vrushank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) induces leptin-mediated leptin gene expression: feed-forward loop operating in the lung.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>29821-29835</pages><volume>288</volume><issue>41</issue><keywords><keyword>Adipocytes</keyword><keyword>Adipocytes: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Adipocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta</keyword><keyword>CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta: genetics</keyword><keyword>CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Genetic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Leptin</keyword><keyword>Leptin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Leptin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leptin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lung: pathology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases: metaboli</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 1</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 1: genetics</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>PTEN Phosphohydrolase</keyword><keyword>PTEN Phosphohydrolase: genetics</keyword><keyword>PTEN Phosphohydrolase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>STAT3 Transcription Factor</keyword><keyword>STAT3 Transcription Factor: genetics</keyword><keyword>STAT3 Transcription Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23963458</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M113.481523</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3795281&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Elevated levels of systemic and pulmonary leptin are associated with diseases related to lung injury and lung cancer. However, the role of leptin in lung biology and pathology, including the mechanism of leptin gene expression in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, including lung cancer, remains elusive. Here, using conditional deletion of tumor suppressor gene Pten in the lung epithelium in vivo in transgenic mice and human PTEN-null lung epithelial cells, we identify the leptin-driven feed-forward signaling loop in the lung epithelial cells. Leptin-mediated leptin/leptin-receptor gene expression likely amplifies leptin signaling that may contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of lung diseases, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Loss of Pten in the lung epithelial cells in vivo activated adipokine signaling and induced leptin synthesis as ascertained by genome-wide mRNA profiling and pathway analysis. Leptin gene transcription was mediated by binding of transcription factors NRF-1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBP) to the proximal promoter regions and STAT3 to the distal promoter regions as revealed by leptin promoter-mutation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gain- and loss-of-function studies in lung epithelial cells. Leptin treatment induced expression of the leptin/leptin receptor in the lung epithelial cells via activation of MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. Expression of constitutively active MEK-1, AKT, and STAT3 proteins increased expression, and treatment with MEK, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors decreased LEP expression, indicating that leptin via MAPK/ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, in turn, further induces its own gene expression. Thus, targeted inhibition of the leptin-mediated feed-forward loop provides a novel rationale for pharmacotherapy of disease associated with lung injury and remodeling, including lung cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reijerkerk, Arie</author><author>Lopez-Ramirez, M Alejandro</author><author>van Het Hof, Bert</author><author>Drexhage, Joost A R</author><author>Kamphuis, Wouter W</author><author>Kooij, Gijs</author><author>Vos, Joost B</author><author>van der Pouw Kraan, Tineke C T M</author><author>van Zonneveld, Anton J</author><author>Horrevoets, Anton J</author><author>Prat, Alexandre</author><author>Romero, Ignacio A</author><author>de Vries, Helga E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNAs regulate human brain endothelial cell-barrier function in inflammation: implications for multiple sclerosis.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>6857-6863</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: pathology</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: genetics</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Multiple Sclerosis</keyword><keyword>Multiple Sclerosis: pathology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration: dr</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Transformed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23595744</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3965-12.2013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595744</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;Inflammation</label><abstract>Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a major hallmark of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS).

We previously showed that triptolide inhibits PDAC cell growth in vitro and blocks metastatic spread in vivo. Triptolide downregulates HSP70, a molecular chaperone upregulated in several tumor types. This study investigates the mechanism by which triptolide inhibits HSP70. Because microRNAs (miRNA) are becoming increasingly recognized as negative regulators of gene expression, we tested whether triptolide regulates HSP70 via miRNAs. Here, we show that triptolide as well as quercetin, but not gemcitabine, upregulated miR-142-3p in PDAC cells (MIA PaCa-2, Capan-1, and S2-013). Ectopic expression of miR-142-3p inhibited cell proliferation, measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, and decreased HSP70 expression, measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, compared with controls. We showed that miR-142-3p directly binds to the 3'UTR of HSP70, and that this interaction is important as HSP70 overexpression rescued miR-142-3p-induced cell death. We found that miR-142-3p regulates HSP70 independently of heat shock factor 1. Furthermore, Minnelide, a water-soluble prodrug of triptolide, induced the expression of miR-142-3p in vivo. This is the first description of an miRNA-mediated mechanism of HSP70 regulation in cancer, making miR-142-3p an attractive target for PDAC therapeutic intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Panfeng</author><author>Mohan, Vijay</author><author>Mansoor, Syed</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Sadikot, Ruxana T</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate–Reduced Oxidase Proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa –Induced Lung Inflammation and Permeability</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>477-488</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2012-0242OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0242OC</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukova, Anna A</author><author>Starosta, Vitaliy</author><author>Tian, Xinyong</author><author>Higginbotham, Katherine</author><author>Koroniak, Lukas</author><author>Berliner, Judith A</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fragmented oxidation products define barrier disruptive endothelial cell response to OxPAPC</title><secondary-title>Translational Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Translational Research</full-title></periodical><pages>495-504</pages><volume>161</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23305708</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.trsl.2012.12.008</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Excessive concentrations of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), the products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PAPC) oxidation have been detected in atherosclerosis, septic inflammation, and acute lung injury (ALI) and have been shown to induce vascular barrier dysfunction. In contrast, oxidized PAPC (OxPAPC) at low concentrations exhibit potent barrier protective effects. The nature of such biphasic effects remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that barrier-disruptive effects of high OxPAPC doses on endothelial cell (EC) monolayer are defined by fragmented products of PAPC oxidation (lysophosphatidyl choline [lyso-PC], 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn- glycero-phosphatidylcholine [POVPC], 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero- phosphatidylcholine [PGPC]), whereas barrier enhancing effects are mediated by full length oxidated PAPC products and may be reproduced by single compounds contained in the OxPAPC such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl choline (PEIPC). All 3 fragmented OxPAPC products increased EC permeability in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PEIPC decreased it and reversed barrier disruptive effects of lyso-PC, POVPC, and PGPC monitored by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis showed that PGPC mimicked the cytoskeletal remodeling and tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction (AJ) protein vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin leading to EC barrier dysfunction induced by high OxPAPC concentrations. Barrier-disruptive effects of PGPC were abrogated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, N-acetyl cysteine, or Src kinase inhibitor, PP-2. The results of this study show that barrier disruptive effects of fragmented OxPAPC constituents (lyso-PC, POVPC, PGPC) are balanced by barrier enhancing effects of full length oxygenated products (PEIPC). These data strongly suggest that barrier disruptive effects of OxPAPC at higher concentrations are dictated by predominant effects of fragmented phospholipids such as PGPC, which promote ROS-dependent activation of Src kinase and VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Tyr658 and Tyr731 leading to disruption of endothelial cell AJs. ?? 2013 Mosby, Inc.

To determine their effects on calcium entry, rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMVEC) were labeled with fluo-4 and calcium entry initiated with the TRPV4 agonist, 4α-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (4αPDD). Mean calcium transients peaked at ∼25 sec and persisted ∼500 sec. The 4αPDD response was essentially abolished in calcium-free media, or after pretreatment with the MLCK inhibitor, ML-7. ML-7 also attenuated the 4αPDD-induced inward calcium current measured directly using whole-cell patch clamp. Pretreatment with dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin produced an initial calcium transient followed by a 4αPDD transient of unchanged peak intensity. Automated averaging of areas under the curve (AUC) of calcium transients in individual cells indicated total calcium activity with a relationship between treatment groups of ML-7 + 4αPDD &lt; 4αPDD only &lt; dynasore + 4αPDD. Measurement of biotinylated surface TRPV4 protein indicated a significant reduction after ML-7 pretreatment, but no significant change with dynasore treatment. RPMVEC monolayer electrical resistances were decreased by only 3% with 10 μmol/L 4αPDD and the response was dose-related. Dynasore alone produced a 29% decrease in resistance, but neither ML-7 nor dynasore affected the subsequent 4αPDD resistance response. These studies suggest that MLCK may inhibit mechanogated calcium responses through reduced surface expression of stretch activated TRPV4 channels in the plasma membrane.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukova, Anna A</author><author>Tian, Xinyong</author><author>Tian, Yufeng</author><author>Higginbotham, Katherine</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rap-afadin axis in control of Rho signaling and endothelial barrier recovery.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><pages>2678-2688</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23864716</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E13-02-0098</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864716</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Activation of the Rho GTPase pathway determines endothelial cell (EC) hyperpermeability after injurious stimuli. To date, feedback mechanisms of Rho down-regulation critical for barrier restoration remain poorly understood. We tested a hypothesis that Rho down-regulation and barrier recovery of agonist-stimulated ECs is mediated by the Ras family GTPase Rap1. Thrombin-induced EC permeability driven by rapid activation of the Rho GTPase pathway was followed by Src kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the Rap1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) C3G, activation of Rap1, and initiation of EC barrier recovery. Knockdown experiments showed that Rap1 activation was essential for down-regulation of Rho signaling and actin stress fiber dissolution. Rap1 activation also enhanced interaction between adherens junction (AJ) proteins VE-cadherin and p120-catenin and stimulated AJ reannealing mediated by the Rap1 effector afadin. This mechanism also included Rap1-dependent membrane translocation of the Rac1-specific GEF Tiam1 and activation of Rac1-dependent peripheral cytoskeletal dynamics, leading to resealing of intercellular gaps. These data demonstrate that activation of the Rap1-afadin axis is a physiological mechanism driving restoration of barrier integrity in agonist-stimulated EC monolayers via negative-feedback regulation of Rho signaling, stimulation of actin peripheral dynamics, and reestablishment of cell-cell adhesive complexes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sasi, W</author><author>Ye, L</author><author>Jiang, W G</author><author>Mokbel, K</author><author>Sharma, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observations on the effects of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 7 (SOCS7) knockdown in breast cancer cells: their in vitro response to Insulin Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I).</title><secondary-title>Clinical &amp; translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical &amp; translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>c c -1 á</keyword><keyword>cranmer terrace</keyword><keyword>cytokine signaling á phospholipase</keyword><keyword>insulin-like growth factor-i á</keyword><keyword>mokbel á a</keyword><keyword>s</keyword><keyword>sasi</keyword><keyword>sharma</keyword><keyword>st george</keyword><keyword>suppressor of</keyword><keyword>university of london</keyword><keyword>w</keyword><keyword>á k</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24046004</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12094-013-1107-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24046004</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PURPOSE: Suppressor of cytokine signaling 7 (SOCS7) is a member of the SOCS family and is known to interact with phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1), one of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor downstream molecules. In this study, we sought to observe the effect of knocking down SOCS7 gene on breast cancer cells in vitro growth and migration and to elucidate whether this involves IGF-I-PLCγ1 route using the PLCγ-1 blocker U73122. METHODS: Suitable breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) were transfected with anti-SOCS7 ribozymal transgene, to create sub-lines with SOCS7 knockdown verified by RT-PCR. The growth and migration of the cells were evaluated in the presence or absence of IGF-I and PLCγ-1 inhibitor using growth assay, scratch-wound and electrical cell impedance sensing (ECIS) migration assays. RESULTS: IGF-I treatment produced more pronounced influence on MCF7 growth and migration and on MDA-MB-231 migration when SOCS7 gene was knocked down in both lines (p &lt; 0.05). The absence of IGF-I-induced growth response in MDA-MB-231 could be due to the intrinsic characteristics of these cells. PLCγ-1 pharmacological inhibition during their in vitro migration seemed to only occur when SOCS7 gene was knocked down. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the SOCS7 regulatory role in IGF-I induced in vitro functions in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. IGF-I treatment and SOCS7 loss have synergistically resulted in increased growth and migration of MCF7 and in increased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The migratory effects could be due to a precise anti-PLCγ-1 role.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dzementsei, a.</author><author>Schneider, D</author><author>Janshoff, A</author><author>Pieler, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Migratory and adhesive properties of Xenopus laevis primordial germ cells in vitro</title><secondary-title>Biology Open</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biology Open</full-title></periodical><pages>1279-1287</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>cellular dynamics</keyword><keyword>primordial germ cells</keyword><keyword>xenopus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/bio.20135140</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://bio.biologists.org/cgi/doi/10.1242/bio.20135140</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waheed, Faiza</author><author>Dan, Qinghong</author><author>Amoozadeh, Yasaman</author><author>Zhang, Yuqian</author><author>Tanimura, Susumu</author><author>Speight, Pam</author><author>Kapus, András</author><author>Szászi, Katalin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Central role of the exchange factor GEF-H1 in TNF-α-induced sequential activation of Rac, ADAM17/TACE, and RhoA in tubular epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1068-1082</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: metabo</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>LLC-PK1 Cells</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinases</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Proximal</keyword><keyword>Proximal: cytology</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23389627</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E12-09-0661</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3608494&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>Transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a key step in mediating RhoA activation and cytoskeleton and junction remodeling in the tubular epithelium. In this study we explore the mechanisms underlying TNF-α-induced EGFR activation. We show that TNF-α stimulates the TNF-α convertase enzyme (TACE/a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17), leading to activation of the EGFR/ERK pathway. TACE activation requires the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, which is activated through the small GTPase Rac. TNF-α stimulates both Rac and RhoA through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1 but by different mechanisms. EGFR- and ERK-dependent phosphorylation at the T678 site of GEF-H1 is a prerequisite for RhoA activation only, whereas both Rac and RhoA activation require GEF-H1 phosphorylation on S885. Of interest, GEF-H1-mediated Rac activation is upstream from the TACE/EGFR/ERK pathway and regulates T678 phosphorylation. We also show that TNF-α enhances epithelial wound healing through TACE, ERK, and GEF-H1. Taken together, our findings can explain the mechanisms leading to hierarchical activation of Rac and RhoA by TNF-α through a single GEF. This mechanism could coordinate GEF functions and fine-tune Rac and RhoA activation in epithelial cells, thereby promoting complex functions such as sheet migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aranda, J F</author><author>Reglero-Real, N</author><author>Marcos-Ramiro, B</author><author>Ruiz-Saenz, A</author><author>Fernandez-Martin, L</author><author>Bernabe-Rubio, M</author><author>Kremer, L</author><author>Ridley, A J</author><author>Correas, I</author><author>Alonso, M A</author><author>Millan, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MYADM controls endothelial barrier function through ERM-dependent regulation of ICAM-1 expression</title><secondary-title>Mol.Biol.Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mol.Biol.Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>483-494</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1939-4586 (Electronic)</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Hela Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1</keyword><keyword>Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells</keyword><keyword>Membrane Microdomains</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Myelin and Lymphocyte-Associated Proteolipid Prote</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rna</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>adhesion</keyword><keyword>antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>barrier</keyword><keyword>blood</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>cytology</keyword><keyword>drug effects</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>junctions</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword><keyword>pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1939-4586 (Electronic) 1059-1524 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23264465</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E11-11-0914</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>Inflammation;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The endothelium maintains a barrier between blood and tissue that becomes more permeable during inflammation. Membrane rafts are ordered assemblies of cholesterol, glycolipids, and proteins that modulate proinflammatory cell signaling and barrier function. In epithelial cells, the MAL family members MAL, MAL2, and myeloid-associated differentiation marker (MYADM) regulate the function and dynamics of ordered membrane domains. We analyzed the expression of these three proteins in human endothelial cells and found that only MYADM is expressed. MYADM was confined in ordered domains at the plasma membrane, where it partially colocalized with filamentous actin and cell-cell junctions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated MYADM knockdown increased permeability, ICAM-1 expression, and leukocyte adhesion, all of which are features of an inflammatory response. Barrier function decrease in MYADM-silenced cells was dependent on ICAM-1 expression. Membrane domains and the underlying actin cytoskeleton can regulate each other and are connected by ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins. In endothelial cells, MYADM knockdown induced ERM activation. Triple-ERM knockdown partially inhibited ICAM-1 increase induced by MYADM siRNA. Importantly, ERM knockdown also reduced ICAM-1 expression in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha. MYADM therefore regulates the connection between the plasma membrane and the cortical cytoskeleton and so can control the endothelial inflammatory response</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keil, Jason M</author><author>Liu, Xuwen</author><author>Antonetti, David A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glucocorticoid induction of occludin expression and endothelial barrier requires transcription factor p54 NONO</title><secondary-title>Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science</full-title></periodical><pages>4007-4015</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Blood-retinal barrier</keyword><keyword>Enhancer</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Tight junction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23640037</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.13-11980</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: Glucocorticoids (GCs) effectively reduce retinal edema and induce vascular barrier properties but possess unwanted side effects. Understanding GC induction of barrier properties may lead to more effective and specific therapies. Previous work identified the occludin enhancer element (OEE) as a GC-responsive cis-element in the promoters of multiple junctional genes, including occludin, claudin-5, and cadherin-9. Here, we identify two OEE-binding factors and determine their contribution to GC induction of tight junction (TJ) gene expression and endothelial barrier properties.\n\nMETHODS: OEE-binding factors were isolated from human retinal endothelial cells (HREC) using DNA affinity purification followed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays determined in situ binding. siRNA was used to evaluate the role of trans-acting factors in transcription of TJ genes in response to GC stimulation. Paracellular permeability was determined by quantifying flux through a cell monolayer, whereas transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using the ECIS system.\n\nRESULTS: MS/MS analysis of HREC nuclear extracts identified the heterodimer of transcription factors p54/NONO (p54) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) as OEE-binding factors, which was confirmed by ChIP assay from GC-treated endothelial cells and rat retina. siRNA knockdown of p54 demonstrated that this factor is necessary for GC induction of occludin and claudin-5 expression. Further, p54 knockdown ablated the pro-barrier effects of GC treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: p54 is essential for GC-mediated expression of occludin, claudin-5, and barrier induction, and the p54/PSF heterodimer may contribute to normal blood-retinal barrier (BRB) induction in vivo. Understanding the mechanism of GC induction of BRB properties may provide novel therapies for macular edema.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Di Lorenzo, Annarita</author><author>Lin, Michelle I</author><author>Murata, Takahisa</author><author>Landskroner-Eiger, Shira</author><author>Schleicher, Michael</author><author>Kothiya, Milankumar</author><author>Iwakiri, Yasuko</author><author>Yu, Jun</author><author>Huang, Paul L</author><author>Sessa, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>eNOS-derived nitric oxide regulates endothelial barrier function through VE-cadherin and Rho GTPases.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>5541-5552</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>Pt 24</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III: genetics</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide: physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Post-Translational</keyword><keyword>Protein Processing</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24046447</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.115972</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3860306&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transient disruption of endothelial adherens junctions and cytoskeletal remodeling are responsible for increases in vascular permeability induced by inflammatory stimuli and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is crucial for VEGF-induced changes in permeability in vivo; however, the molecular mechanism by which endogenous NO modulates endothelial permeability is not clear. Here, we show that the lack of eNOS reduces VEGF-induced permeability, an effect mediated by enhanced activation of the Rac GTPase and stabilization of cortical actin. The loss of NO increased the recruitment of the Rac guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) TIAM1 to adherens junctions and VE-cadherin (also known as cadherin 5), and reduced Rho activation and stress fiber formation. In addition, NO deficiency reduced VEGF-induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation and impaired the localization, but not the activation, of c-Src to cell junctions. The physiological role of eNOS activation is clear given that VEGF-, histamine- and inflammation-induced vascular permeability is reduced in mice bearing a non-phosphorylatable knock-in mutation of the key eNOS phosphorylation site S1176. Thus, NO is crucial for Rho GTPase-dependent regulation of cytoskeletal architecture leading to reversible changes in vascular permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Öz, Simin</author><author>Maercker, Christian</author><author>Breiling, Achim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Embryonic carcinoma cells show specific dielectric resistance profiles during induced differentiation.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e59895</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells</keyword><keyword>Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Tretinoin</keyword><keyword>Tretinoin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23533658</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0059895</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3606267&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Differentiation</label><abstract>Induction of differentiation in cancer stem cells by drug treatment represents an important approach for cancer therapy. The understanding of the mechanisms that regulate such a forced exit from malignant pluripotency is fundamental to enhance our knowledge of tumour stability. Certain nucleoside analogues, such as 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine and 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine, can induce the differentiation of the embryonic cancer stem cell line NTERA 2 D1 (NT2). Such induced differentiation is associated with drug-dependent DNA-damage, cellular stress and the proteolytic depletion of stem cell factors. In order to further elucidate the mode of action of these nucleoside drugs, we monitored differentiation-specific changes of the dielectric properties of growing NT2 cultures using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). We measured resistance values of untreated and retinoic acid treated NT2 cells in real-time and compared their impedance profiles to those of cell populations triggered to differentiate with several established substances, including nucleoside drugs. Here we show that treatment with retinoic acid and differentiation-inducing drugs can trigger specific, concentration-dependent changes in dielectric resistance of NT2 cultures, which can be observed as early as 24 hours after treatment. Further, low concentrations of nucleoside drugs induce differentiation-dependent impedance values comparable to those obtained after retinoic acid treatment, whereas higher concentrations induce proliferation defects. Finally, we show that impedance profiles of substance-induced NT2 cells and those triggered to differentiate by depletion of the stem cell factor OCT4 are very similar, suggesting that reduction of OCT4 levels has a dominant function for differentiation induced by nucleoside drugs and retinoic acid. The data presented show that NT2 cells have specific dielectric properties, which allow the early identification of differentiating cultures and real-time label-free monitoring of differentiation processes. This work might provide a basis for further analyses of drug candidates for differentiation therapy of cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deharvengt, Sophie J.</author><author>Tse, Dan</author><author>Sideleva, Olga</author><author>McGarry, Caitlin</author><author>Gunn, Jason R.</author><author>Longnecker, Daniel S.</author><author>Carriere, Catherine</author><author>Stan, Radu V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PV1 down-regulation via shRNA inhibits the growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2690-2700</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiogenesis</keyword><keyword>Caveolae</keyword><keyword>Fenestrae</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic cancer</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial channels</keyword><keyword>Tumour microenvironment</keyword><keyword>Vesiculo-vacuolar organelles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22568538</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01587.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/50588935/PV1_down-regulation_via_shRNA_inhibits_t20161128-2533-15l8db8.pdf?1480331845=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DPV1_down_regulation_via_shRNA_inhibits_t.pdf&amp;Expires=1629390836&amp;Signature=RLZUHW</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Proliferation;Wound Healing</label><abstract>PV1 is an endothelial-specific protein with structural roles in the formation of diaphragms in endothelial cells of normal vessels. PV1 is also highly expressed on endothelial cells of many solid tumours. On the basis of in vitro data, PV1 is thought to actively participate in angiogenesis. To test whether or not PV1 has a function in tumour angiogenesis and in tumour growth in vivo, we have treated pancreatic tumour-bearing mice by single-dose intratumoural delivery of lentiviruses encoding for two different shRNAs targeting murine PV1. We find that PV1 down-regulation by shRNAs inhibits the growth of established tumours derived from two different human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3). The effect observed is because of down-regulation of PV1 in the tumour endothelial cells of host origin, PV1 being specifically expressed in tumour vascular endothelial cells and not in cancer or other stromal cells. There are no differences in vascular density of tumours treated or not with PV1 shRNA, and gain and loss of function of PV1 in endothelial cells does not modify either their proliferation or migration, suggesting that tumour angiogenesis is not impaired. Together, our data argue that down-regulation of PV1 in tumour endothelial cells results in the inhibition of tumour growth via a mechanism different from inhibiting angiogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boratkó, Anita</author><author>Gergely, Pál</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell cycle dependent association of EBP50 with protein phosphatase 2A in endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22523604</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0035595</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22523604/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is a phosphorylatable PDZ domain-containing adaptor protein that is abundantly expressed in epithelium but was not yet studied in the endothelium. We report unusual nuclear localization of EBP50 in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC). Immunofluorescent staining and cellular fractionation demonstrated that EBP50 is present in the nuclear and perinuclear region in interphase cells. In the prophase of mitosis EBP50 redistributes to the cytoplasmic region in a phosphorylation dependent manner and during mitosis EBP50 co-localizes with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Furthermore, in vitro wound healing of BPAEC expressing phospho-mimic mutant of EBP50 was accelerated indicating that EBP50 is involved in the regulation of the cell division. Cell cycle dependent specific interactions were detected between EBP50 and the subunits of PP2A (A, C, and Bα) with immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments. The interaction of EBP50 with the Bα containing form of PP2A suggests that this holoenzyme of PP2A can be responsible for the dephosphorylation of EBP50 in cytokinesis. Moreover, the results underline the significance of EBP50 in cell division via reversible phosphorylation of the protein with cyclin dependent kinase and PP2A in normal cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Xiaoguang</author><author>Singleton, Patrick A.</author><author>Letsiou, Eleftheria</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author><author>Belvitch, Patrick</author><author>Sammani, Saad</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T.</author><author>Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana</author><author>Wade, Michael S.</author><author>Zhou, Tong</author><author>Liu, Bin</author><author>Parastatidis, Ioannis</author><author>Thomson, Leonor</author><author>Ischiropoulos, Harry</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R.</author><author>MacHado, Roberto F.</author><author>Dudek, Steven M.</author><author>Garcia, Joe G.N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3 is a novel biomarker in acute lung injury</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>628-636</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute lung injury</keyword><keyword>Biomarker</keyword><keyword>Microparticles</keyword><keyword>Nitration</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22771388</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2012-0048OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3 is a novel biomarker in acute lung injury..pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Barrier Function</label><abstract>The inflamed lung exhibits oxidative and nitrative modifications of multiple target proteins, potentially reflecting disease severity and progression. We identified sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3 (S1PR3), a critical signaling molecule mediating cell proliferation and vascular permeability, as a nitrated plasma protein in mice with acute lung injury (ALI). We explored S1PR3 as a potential biomarker in murine and human ALI. In vivo nitrated and total S1PR3 concentrations were determined by immunoprecipitation and microarray studies in mice, and by ELISA in human plasma. In vitro nitrated S1PR3 concentrations were evaluated in human lung vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or within microparticles shed from ECs after exposure to barrier-disrupting agonists (LPS, low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, and thrombin). The effects of S1PR3-containingmicroparticles on EC barrier function were assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). Nitrated S1PR3 was identified in the plasma of murine ALI and in humans with severe sepsis-induced ALI. Elevated total S1PR3 plasma concentrations (&gt; 251 pg/ml) were linked to sepsis and ALI mortality. In vitro EC exposure to barrierdisrupting agents induced S1PR3 nitration and the shedding of S1PR3-containing microparticles, which significantly reduced TER, consistent with increased permeability. These changes were attenuated by reduced S1PR3 expression (small interfering RNAs). These results suggest that microparticles containing nitrated S1PR3 shed into the circulation during inflammatory lung states, and represent a novel ALI biomarker linked to disease severity and outcome.

These adhesive junctions are comprised of protein complexes that serve to establish an intercellular cytoskeletal network for anchoring cells, in addition to regulating cell polarity, molecular transport and communication. The expression of cell adhesion molecules is tightly controlled and their downregulation is essential for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that facilitates the generation of morphologically and functionally diverse cell types during embryogenesis. The characteristics of EMT are a loss of cell adhesion and increased cellular mobility. Hence, in addition to its normal role in development, dysregulated EMT has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis, the process whereby primary tumors migrate to invasive secondary sites in the body. This paper will review the current understanding of cell junctions and their role in cancer, with reference to the abnormal regulation of junction protein genes. The potential use of cell junction molecules as diagnostic and prognostic markers will also be discussed, as well as possible therapies for adhesive dysregulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Powers, Michael E</author><author>Kim, Hwan Keun</author><author>Wang, Yang</author><author>Bubeck Wardenburg, Juliane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAM10 Mediates Vascular Injury Induced by Staphylococcus aureus α-Hemolysin.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>206</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22474035</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/infdis/jis192</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (ADAM10 Mediates Vascular Injury Induced by Staphylococcus aureus α-Hemolysin. - Powers, Michael E; Kim, Hwan Keun; Wang, Yang; Bubeck Wardenburg, Juliane)

The interaction of S. aureus with the endothelium is central to bloodstream infection pathophysiology yet remains ill-understood. We show herein that staphylococcal α-hemolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin, is required for full virulence in a murine sepsis model. The α-hemolysin binding to its receptor A-disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) upregulates the receptor's metalloprotease activity on endothelial cells, causing vascular endothelial-cadherin cleavage and concomitant loss of endothelial barrier function. These cellular injuries and sepsis severity can be mitigated by ADAM10 inhibition. This study therefore provides mechanistic insight into toxin-mediated endothelial injury and suggests new therapeutic approaches for staphylococcal sepsis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baig, Ruqia Mehmood</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Kayani, Mahmood Akhtar</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of Differentiation-Related Gene-1 (DRG1) with Breast Cancer Survival and in Vitro Impact of DRG1 Suppression</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>658-672</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>drg1</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>prognosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers4030658</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/4/3/658/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Desai, Shyamal D</author><author>Reed, Ryan E</author><author>Burks, Julian</author><author>Wood, Laurence M</author><author>Pullikuth, Ashok K</author><author>Haas, Arthur L</author><author>Liu, Leroy F</author><author>Breslin, Jerome W</author><author>Meiners, Sally</author><author>Sankar, Surendran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ISG15 disrupts cytoskeletal architecture and promotes motility in human breast cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)</full-title></periodical><pages>38-49</pages><volume>237</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: pathology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interferons</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex</keyword><keyword>Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes: genetics</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitins</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22185919</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1258/ebm.2011.011236</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22185919</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) pathway is highly elevated in breast cancer; however, very little is known about how the ISG15 pathway contributes to breast tumorigenesis. In the current study, using the gene disruption approach, we demonstrate that both ISG15 and UbcH8 (ISG15-specific conjugating enzyme) disrupt F-actin architecture and formation of focal adhesions in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. In addition, ISG15 and UbcH8 promote breast cancer cell migration. We also demonstrate that ISG15 inhibits ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated turnover of proteins implicated in tumor cell motility, invasion and metastasis. Together, our results suggest that the aberrant activation of the ISG15 pathway confers a motile phenotype to breast cancer cells by disrupting cell architecture and stabilizing proteins involved in cell motility, invasion and metastasis. Because the cellular architecture is conserved and the ISG15 pathway is constitutively activated in tumor cells of different lineages, it is reasonable to assume that our observations in breast cancer must hold true for many other tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Timmerman, Ilse</author><author>Hoogenboezem, Mark</author><author>Bennett, Anton M</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>van Buul, Jaap D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 regulates recovery of endothelial adherens junctions through control of β-catenin phosphorylation.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><pages>4212-4225</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>COS Cells</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cercopithecus aethiops</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Silencing</keyword><keyword>Gene Silencing: drug effects</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Non-Receptor Type 11</keyword><keyword>Non-Receptor Type 11: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphotyrosine</keyword><keyword>Phosphotyrosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase</keyword><keyword>Substrate Specificity</keyword><keyword>Substrate Specificity: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22956765</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E12-01-0038</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3484100&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Impaired endothelial barrier function results in a persistent increase in endothelial permeability and vascular leakage. Repair of a dysfunctional endothelial barrier requires controlled restoration of adherens junctions, comprising vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and associated β-, γ-, α-, and p120-catenins. Little is known about the mechanisms by which recovery of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions is regulated. Using the inflammatory mediator thrombin, we demonstrate an important role for the Src homology 2-domain containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) in mediating recovery of the VE-cadherin-controlled endothelial barrier. Using SHP2 substrate-trapping mutants and an in vitro phosphatase activity assay, we validate β-catenin as a bona fide SHP2 substrate. SHP2 silencing and SHP2 inhibition both result in delayed recovery of endothelial barrier function after thrombin stimulation. Moreover, on thrombin challenge, we find prolonged elevation in tyrosine phosphorylation levels of VE-cadherin-associated β-catenin in SHP2-depleted cells. No disassembly of the VE-cadherin complex is observed throughout the thrombin response. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we show that loss of SHP2 reduces the mobility of VE-cadherin at recovered cell-cell junctions. In conclusion, our data show that the SHP2 phosphatase plays an important role in the recovery of disrupted endothelial cell-cell junctions by dephosphorylating VE-cadherin-associated β-catenin and promoting the mobility of VE-cadherin at the plasma membrane.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosanquet, David C</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Harding, Keith G</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of HuR in keratinocyte migration and wound healing.</title><secondary-title>Molecular medicine reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular medicine reports</full-title></periodical><pages>529-534</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Hu Paraneoplastic Encephalomyelitis Antigens</keyword><keyword>Hu Paraneoplastic Encephalomyelitis Antigens: gene</keyword><keyword>Hu Paraneoplastic Encephalomyelitis Antigens: meta</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interphase</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: cytology</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22086295</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/mmr.2011.675</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22086295</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Human antigen R (HuR) is a post-translational modifier of mRNAs rich in AU- and U-rich elements. These mRNAs typically code for proteins involved in cell growth and differentiation, signal transduction, transcriptional and translational control, apoptosis, nutrient transport and metabolism. Thus, HuR affects a variety of biological functions and processes. Via its effect on growth and cellular migration, HuR has been shown to enhance clinical progression of a number of cancers. Its role in wound healing remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated HuR tissue expression in a cohort of chronic healed and non-healed leg ulcers. We also evaluated the effect of HuR knockdown on a number of cellular processes using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. HuR was expressed in greater levels in the 'chronic healed' cohort of ulcers, compared to the 'chronic non-healed', although this failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.13). HuR knockdown resulted in greater cellular growth, faster progression through the cell cycle and reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, it reduced cellular adhesion rates without affecting migration. We, therefore, concluded that HuR promotes wound healing, primarily through its effect on cellular adhesion. It also slows cellular growth rate via its effect on both cell cycle progression and rates of apoptosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Yen-Hsien</author><author>Chang, Jung-Jhih</author><author>Yang, Ming-Chien</author><author>Chien, Chiang-Ting</author><author>Lai, Wen-Fu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acceleration of wound healing in diabetic rats by layered hydrogel dressing</title><secondary-title>Carbohydrate Polymers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carbohydrate Polymers</full-title></periodical><pages>809-819</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.12.045</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0144861712000483</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>n this study, a novel layered hydrogel composing of alginate (AL), chitosan (CS), and poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) was prepared.

In vitro evaluation of cell migration and proliferation were carried out on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Effect of the hydrogels on wound healing was examined in type 1 diabetic rat model induced by streptozotoxin (STZ). After grafting to full-thickness wounds in diabetic rats, AL–CS–PGA exhibited higher rate of wound healing than conventional AL hydrogels. Epithelialization and collagen deposition were examined histologically. Hydroxyproline levels also were assessed in the wound skin.

RTgill-W1 cells seeded on enclosed fluidic biochips and monitored using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology responded to 18 out of the 18 toxic chemicals tested within one hour of exposure. Nine of these chemical responses were within established concentration ranges specified by the U.S. Army for comparison of toxicity sensors for field application. The RTgill-W1 cells remain viable on the biochips at ambient carbon dioxide levels at 6°C for 78weeks without media changes. RTgill-W1 biochips stored in this manner were challenged with 9.4μM sodium pentachlorophenate (PCP), a benchmark toxicant, and impedance responses were significant (p&lt;0.001) for all storage times tested. This poikilothermic cell line has toxicant sensitivity comparable to a mammalian cell line (bovine lung microvessel endothelial cells (BLMVECs)) that was tested on fluidic biochips with the same chemicals. In order to remain viable, the BLMVEC biochips required media replenishments 3 times per week while being maintained at 37°C. The ability of RTgill-W1 biochips to maintain monolayer integrity without media replenishments for 78weeks, combined with their chemical sensitivity and rapid response time, make them excellent candidates for use in low cost, maintenance-free field-portable biosensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Peng</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Li, Han</author><author>Yang, Yong</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The tumour suppressive role of metastasis suppressor-1, MTSS1, in human kidney cancer, a possible connection with the SHH pathway.</title><secondary-title>Journal of experimental therapeutics &amp; oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of experimental therapeutics &amp; oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>91-99</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Flow Cytometry</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kidney Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Kidney Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Kidney Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Kidney Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Veratrum Alkaloids</keyword><keyword>Veratrum Alkaloids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23350348</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23350348</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis</label><abstract>Metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1), a cytoskeletal associated protein, has been indicated in certain types of human cancers, but its role in kidney cancer remains unknown.

Here we report that Rac1 associates with the ubiquitin-protein ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4). This interaction requires the hypervariable C-terminal domain of Rac1 and the WW domains of Nedd4. Activated Rac1 colocalises with endogenous Nedd4 at epithelial cell-cell contacts. Reduction of Nedd4 expression by shRNA results in reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and concomitant changes in the distribution of adherens and tight junction markers. Conversely, expression of Nedd4 promotes TER, suggesting that Nedd4 cooperates with Rac1 in the induction of junctional maturation. We found that Nedd4, but not Nedd4-2, mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of the adapter protein dishevelled-1 (Dvl1), the expression of which negatively regulates cell-cell contact. Nedd4-mediated ubiquitylation requires its binding to the C-terminal domain of Dvl1, comprising the DEP domain, and targets an N-terminal lysine-rich region upstream of the Dvl1 DIX domain. We found that endogenous Rac1 colocalises with endogenous Dvl1 in intracellular puncta as well as on cell-cell junctions. Finally, activated Rac1 was found to stimulate Nedd4 activity, resulting in increased ubiquitylation of Dvl1. Together, these data reveal a novel Rac1-dependent signalling pathway that, through Nedd4-mediated ubiquitylation of Dvl1, stimulates the maturation of epithelial cell-cell contacts.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cioffi, Donna L</author><author>Pandey, Subha</author><author>Alvarez, Diego F</author><author>Cioffi, Eugene a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Terminal sialic acids are an important determinant of pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Importantly, understanding of the structure and function of the endothelial glycocalyx is poorly understood. Preliminary studies have demonstrated structural differences in the glycocalyx of pulmonary artery endothelial cells compared with pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Herein we begin to probe in more detail structural and functional attributes of endothelial cell-surface carbohydrates. In this study we focus on the expression and function of sialic acids in pulmonary endothelium. We observed that, although pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells express similar amounts of total sialic acids as pulmonary artery endothelial cells, the nature of the sialic acid linkages differs between the two cell types such that pulmonary artery endothelial cells express both α(2,3)- and α(2,6)-linked sialic acids on the surface (i.e., surficially), whereas microvascular endothelial cells principally express α(2,3)-linked sialic acids. To determine whether sialic acids play a role in endothelial barrier function, cells were treated with neuraminidases to hydrolyze sialic acid moieties. Disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions was observed following neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that terminal sialic acids promote endothelial barrier integrity. When we measured transendothelial resistance, differential responses of pulmonary artery and microvascular endothelial cells to neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens suggest that the molecular architecture of the sialic acid glycomes differs between these two cell types. Collectively our observations reveal critical structural and functional differences of terminally linked sialic acids on the pulmonary endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krishnamoorthy, Sriram</author><author>Recchiuti, Antonio</author><author>Chiang, Nan</author><author>Fredman, Gabrielle</author><author>Serhan, Charles N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resolvin D1 receptor stereoselectivity and regulation of inflammation and proresolving microRNAs.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>2018-2027</pages><volume>180</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arrestins</keyword><keyword>Arrestins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Docosahexaenoic Acids</keyword><keyword>Docosahexaenoic Acids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Docosahexaenoic Acids: physiology</keyword><keyword>Docosahexaenoic Acids: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Formyl Peptide</keyword><keyword>Formyl Peptide: physiology</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-10</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-10: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-10: genetics</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Ligands</keyword><keyword>Lipoxin</keyword><keyword>Lipoxin: physiology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neutrophil Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Neutrophil Infiltration: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neutrophil Infiltration: physiology</keyword><keyword>Peritonitis</keyword><keyword>Peritonitis: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Peritonitis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peritonitis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation: drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22449948</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.01.028</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3349829&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Inflammation</label><abstract>Resolution of acute inflammation is an active process that involves the biosynthesis of specialized proresolving lipid mediators. Among them, resolvin D1 (RvD1) actions are mediated by two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ALX/FPR2 and GPR32, that also regulate specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes in novel resolution circuits. We report the ligand selectivity of RvD1 activation of ALX/FPR2 and GPR32. In addition to RvD1, its aspirin-triggered epimer and RvD1 analogs each dose dependently and effectively activated ALX/FPR2 and GPR32 in GPCR-overexpressing β-arrestin systems using luminescence and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. To corroborate these findings in vivo, neutrophil infiltration in self-limited peritonitis was reduced in human ALX/FPR2-overexpressing transgenic mice that was further limited to 50% by RvD1 treatment with as little as 10 ng of RvD1 per mouse. Analysis of miRNA expression revealed that RvD1 administration significantly up-regulated miR-208a and miR-219 in exudates isolated from ALX/FPR2 transgenic mice compared with littermates. Overexpression of miR-208a in human macrophages up-regulated IL-10. In comparison, in ALX/FPR2 knockout mice, RvD1 neither significantly reduced leukocyte infiltration in zymosan-induced peritonitis nor regulated miR-208a and IL-10 in these mice. Together, these results demonstrate the selectivity of RvD1 interactions with receptors ALX/FPR2 and GPR32. Moreover, they establish a new molecular circuit that is operative in the resolution of acute inflammation activated by the proresolving mediator RvD1 involving specific GPCRs and miRNAs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valcarcel-Ares, M Noa</author><author>Gautam, Tripti</author><author>Warrington, Junie P</author><author>Bailey-Downs, Lora</author><author>Sosnowska, Danuta</author><author>de Cabo, Rafael</author><author>Losonczy, Gyorgy</author><author>Sonntag, William E</author><author>Ungvari, Zoltan</author><author>Csiszar, Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disruption of Nrf2 Signaling Impairs Angiogenic Capacity of Endothelial Cells: Implications for Microvascular Aging.</title><secondary-title>The journals of gerontology.

Previous studies demonstrated that aging is associated with Nrf2 dysfunction in endothelial cells, which alters redox signaling and likely promotes the development of large vessel disease. Much less is known about the consequences of Nrf2 dysfunction at the level of the microcirculation. To test the hypothesis that Nrf2 regulates angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells, we determined whether disruption of Nrf2 signaling (by siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 and overexpression of Keap1, the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2) impairs angiogenic processes in cultured human coronary arterial endothelial cells stimulated with vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1. In the absence of functional Nrf2, coronary arterial endothelial cells exhibited impaired proliferation and adhesion to vitronectin and collagen. Disruption of Nrf2 signaling also reduced cellular migration (measured by a wound-healing assay using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology) and impaired the ability of coronary arterial endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures. Collectively, we find that Nrf2 is essential for normal endothelial angiogenic processes, suggesting that Nrf2 dysfunction may be a potential mechanism underlying impaired angiogenesis and microvascular rarefaction in aging.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heijink, I H</author><author>Brandenburg, S M</author><author>Postma, D S</author><author>van Oosterhout, a J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cigarette smoke impairs airway epithelial barrier function and cell-cell contact recovery.</title><secondary-title>The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>419-428</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chronic Obstructive</keyword><keyword>Chronic Obstructive: etiology</keyword><keyword>Chronic Obstructive: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Chronic Obstructive: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electroporation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Disease</keyword><keyword>Quinazolines</keyword><keyword>Quinazolines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: cytology</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Smoking</keyword><keyword>Smoking: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tyrphostins</keyword><keyword>Tyrphostins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21778164</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/09031936.00193810</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21778164</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;ECIS TEER;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Cigarette smoking, the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), induces aberrant airway epithelial structure and function. The underlying mechanisms are unresolved so far. We studied effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on epithelial barrier function and wound regeneration in human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) from COPD patients, nonsmokers and healthy smokers. We demonstrate that CSE rapidly and transiently impairs 16HBE barrier function, largely due to disruption of cell-cell contacts. CSE induced a similar, but stronger and more sustained, defect in PBECs. Application of the specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AG1478 showed that EGFR activation contributes to the CSE-induced defects in both 16HBE cells and PBECs. Furthermore, our data indicate that the endogenous protease calpain mediates these defects through tight junction protein degradation. CSE also delayed the reconstitution of 16HBE intercellular contacts during wound healing and attenuated PBEC barrier function upon wound regeneration. These findings were comparable between PBECs from smokers, healthy smokers and COPD patients. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that CSE reduces epithelial integrity, probably by EGFR and calpain-dependent disruption of intercellular contacts. This may increase susceptibility to environmental insults, e.g. inhaled pathogens. Thus, EGFR may be a promising target for therapeutic strategies to improve mucosal barrier function in cigarette smoking-related disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Mei</author><author>Chen, Gang</author><author>Fu, Wei</author><author>Liao, Mingjun</author><author>Frank, Jacqueline A</author><author>Bower, Kimberly A</author><author>Fang, Shengyun</author><author>Zhang, Zhuo</author><author>Shi, Xianglin</author><author>Luo, Jia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethanol disrupts vascular endothelial barrier: implication in cancer metastasis.</title><secondary-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>42-53</pages><volume>127</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22331491</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/toxsci/kfs087</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22331491</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Both epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that ethanol exposure enhances tumor progression. Ethanol exposure promotes cancer cell invasion and is implicated in tumor metastasis. Metastasis consists of multiple processes involving intravasation and extravasation of cancer cells across the blood vessel walls. The integrity of the vascular endothelial barrier that lines the inner surface of blood vessels plays a critical role in cancer cell intravasation/extravasation. We examined the effects of ethanol on the endothelial integrity in vitro. Ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations did not alter cell viability but disrupted the endothelial monolayer integrity, which was evident by a decrease in the electric resistance and the appearance of intercellular gaps in the endothelial monolayer. The effect of ethanol was reversible once ethanol was removed. The disruption of the endothelial monolayer integrity was associated with an increased invasion of cancer cells through the endothelial monolayer. Ethanol induced the formation of stress fibers; stabilization of actin filaments by jasplakinolide prevented ethanol-induced disruption of endothelial integrity and cancer cell invasion. VE-cadherin is a critical component of the adherens junctions, which regulates vascular endothelial integrity. Ethanol induced the endocytosis of VE-cadherin and the effect was blocked by jasplakinolide. Our results indicate that ethanol may facilitate cancer metastasis by disrupting the vascular endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bodor, Csaba</author><author>Nagy, János Péter</author><author>Végh, Borbála</author><author>Németh, Adrienn</author><author>Jenei, Attila</author><author>MirzaHosseini, Shahrokh</author><author>Sebe, Attila</author><author>Rosivall, László</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiotensin II increases the permeability and PV-1 expression of endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

In this study the permeability changes and its morphological attributes in endothelial cells of human umbilical vein (HUVECs) were studied considering the potential regulatory role of ANG II. The effects of ANG II were compared with those of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Permeability was determined by 40 kDa FITC-Dextran and electrical impedance measurements. Plasmalemmal vesicle-1 (PV-1) mRNA levels were measured by PCR. Endothelial cell surface was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and caveolae were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in HUVEC monolayers. ANG II (10(-7) M), similarly to VEGF (100 ng/ml), increased the endothelial permeability parallel with an increase in the number of cell surface openings and caveolae. AT1 and VEGF-R2 receptor blockers (candesartan and ZM-323881, respectively) blunted these effects. ANG II and VEGF increased the expression of PV-1, which could be blocked by candesartan or ZM-323881 pretreatments and by the p38 mitogem-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB-203580. Additionally, SB-203580 blocked the increase in endothelial permeability and the number of surface openings and caveolae. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ANG II plays a role in regulation of permeability and formation of cell surface openings through AT1 receptor and PV-1 protein synthesis in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner in endothelial cells. The surface openings that increase in parallel with permeability may represent transcellular channels, caveolae, or both. These morphological and permeability changes may be involved in (patho-) physiological effects of ANG II.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Male, Keith B</author><author>Lam, Edmond</author><author>Montes, Johnny</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Noninvasive cell-based impedance spectroscopy for real-time probing inhibitory effects of graphene derivatives.</title><secondary-title>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</full-title></periodical><pages>3643-3649</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Tracking</keyword><keyword>Cell Tracking: methods</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Dielectric Spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Dielectric Spectroscopy: methods</keyword><keyword>Graphite</keyword><keyword>Graphite: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Graphite: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Materials Testing</keyword><keyword>Materials Testing: methods</keyword><keyword>Oxides</keyword><keyword>Oxides: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Oxides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Sf9 Cells</keyword><keyword>Spodoptera</keyword><keyword>Tissue Scaffolds</keyword><keyword>Tissue Scaffolds: chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22746697</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/am301060z</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22746697</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Three water-dispersible graphene derivatives, graphene oxide (GO), sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), and sulfonated graphene (SG), were prepared and probed for their plausible cytotoxicity by non-invasive electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). With Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells adhered on gold microelectrodes as an active interface, it is feasible to monitor changes in impedance upon exposure to different graphene derivatives. Sf9 insect cells were then exposed to different concentrations of graphene derivatives and their spreading and viability were monitored and quantified by ECIS in real-time. On the basis of the 50% inhibition concentration (ECIS50), none of the graphene derivatives were judged to have any significant cytotoxicity with respect to the chosen cell line as the ECIS50 values were all above 100 μg/mL. However, all graphene derivatives exhibited inhibitory effects on the Sf9 response at the cell spreading level with the following order: SG (ECIS50 = 121 ± 8 μg/mL), SGO (ECIS50 = 151 ± 9 μg/mL), and GO (ECIS50 = 232 ± 27 μg/mL), reflecting differences observed in their ζ-potential and surface area. The presence of phenyl sulfonyl groups in SGO and SG improves their aqueous dispersity which enables these materials to have a greater inhibitory effect on Sf9 insect cells in comparison to GO.

In mice, CR exerts significant microvascular protective effects resulting in increased microvascular density in the heart and the brain, which likely contribute to enhanced tolerance to ischemia and improved cardiac performance and cognitive function. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which CR confer microvascular protection remain elusive. To test the hypothesis that circulating factors triggered by CR regulate endothelial angiogenic capacity, we treated cultured human endothelial cells with sera derived from Macaca mulatta on long-term (over 10 years) CR. Cells treated with sera derived from ad-libitum-fed control monkeys served as controls. We found that factors present in CR sera upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and stimulate angiogenic processes, including endothelial cell proliferation and formation of capillary-like structures. Treatment with CR sera also tended to increase cellular migration (measured by a wound-healing assay using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing [ECIS] technology) and adhesion to collagen. Collectively, we find that circulating factors induced by CR promote endothelial angiogenic processes, suggesting that increased angiogenesis may be a potential mechanism by which CR improves cardiac function and prevents vascular cognitive impairment.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilkerson, Brent A</author><author>Grass, G Daniel</author><author>Wing, Shane B</author><author>Argraves, W Scott</author><author>Argraves, Kelley M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) carrier-dependent regulation of endothelial barrier: high density lipoprotein (HDL)-S1P prolongs endothelial barrier enhancement as compared with albumin-S1P via effects on levels, trafficking, and signaling of S1P1.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>44645-44653</pages><volume>287</volume><issue>53</issue><keywords><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>HDL</keyword><keyword>HDL: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: genetics</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Serum Albumin</keyword><keyword>Serum Albumin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23135269</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M112.423426</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3531779&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a blood-borne lysosphingolipid that acts to promote endothelial cell (EC) barrier function. In plasma, S1P is associated with both high density lipoproteins (HDL) and albumin, but it is not known whether the carriers impart different effects on S1P signaling. Here we establish that HDL-S1P sustains EC barrier longer than albumin-S1P. We showed that the sustained barrier effects of HDL-S1P are dependent on signaling by the S1P receptor, S1P1, and involve persistent activation of Akt and endothelial NOS (eNOS), as well as activity of the downstream NO target, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Total S1P1 protein levels were found to be higher in response to HDL-S1P treatment as compared with albumin-S1P, and this effect was not associated with increased S1P1 mRNA or dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Several pieces of evidence indicate that long term EC barrier enhancement activity of HDL-S1P is due to specific effects on S1P1 trafficking. First, the rate of S1P1 degradation, which is proteasome-mediated, was slower in HDL-S1P-treated cells as compared with cells treated with albumin-S1P. Second, the long term barrier-promoting effects of HDL-S1P were abrogated by treatment with the recycling blocker, monensin. Finally, cell surface levels of S1P1 and levels of S1P1 in caveolin-enriched microdomains were higher after treatment with HDL-S1P as compared with albumin-S1P. Together, the findings reveal S1P carrier-specific effects on S1P1 and point to HDL as the physiological mediator of sustained S1P1-PI3K-Akt-eNOS-sGC-dependent EC barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lucas, R</author><author>Sridhar, S</author><author>Rick, F G</author><author>Gorshkov, B</author><author>Umapathy, N S</author><author>Yang, G</author><author>Oseghale, A</author><author>Verin, a.

However, in this context, little is known about how selective activation of the cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB2R) affects the activated state of the brain endothelium and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Using human brain tissues and primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), we demonstrate that the CB2R is highly upregulated during inflammatory insult. We then examined whether the CB2R agonists could attenuate inflammatory responses at the BBB using a mouse model of LPS-induced encephalitis and highly selective CB2R agonists. Visualization by intravital microscopy revealed that administration of JWH133 [(6aR,10aR)-3-(1,1-dimethylbutyl)-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran] or a novel resorcinol-based compound, O-1966 (1-[4-(1,1-dimethyl-heptyl)-2,6-dimethoxy-phenyl]-3-methyl-cyclohexanol), greatly attenuated leukocyte adhesion in surface pial vessels and in deep ascending cortical postcapillary venules. BBB permeability assessments with small and large fluorescent tracers showed that CB2R agonists were effective at preventing barrier leakiness after LPS administration. To determine whether the effects by CB2R agonists on barrier protection are not only due to the CB2R modulation of immune cell function, we tested the agonists in vitro with barrier-forming primary BMVECs. Remarkably, the addition of CB2R agonist increased transendothelial electrical resistance and increased the amount of tight junction protein present in membrane fractions. Furthermore, CB2R agonists decreased the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 surface expression in BMVECs exposed to various proinflammatory mediators. Together, these results suggest that pharmacological CB2R ligands offer a new strategy for BBB protection during neuroinflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Peng</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Li, Han</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Yang, Yong</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth differentiation factor-9 expression is inversely correlated with an aggressive behaviour in human bladder cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>International journal of molecular medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of molecular medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>428-434</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Growth Differentiation Factor 9</keyword><keyword>Growth Differentiation Factor 9: genetics</keyword><keyword>Growth Differentiation Factor 9: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms: pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22159313</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijmm.2011.858</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22159313</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) is a family member of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which belong to the TGF-β superfamily. There has been a recent surge of interest in the role of growth differentiation factors and other BMPs in the development and spread of cancer. However, the role of GDF-9 in bladder cancer remains unknown. The present study investigated the expression of GDF-9 in normal and malignant human bladder tissue and its molecular interactions within bladder cancer cells. The expression of GDF-9 in human bladder tissues and bladder cancer cell lines was assessed at both the mRNA and protein levels using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Full-length GDF-9 cDNA was amplified from normal mammary tissues. GDF-9 was overexpressed in bladder cancer cell lines using a mammalian expression construct. The effect of GDF-9 on cellular functions, was examined in bladder cancer cells overexpressing GDF-9 using a variety of in vitro assays. In normal bladder tissues, stronger staining of GDF-9 was seen in transitional cells, both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In contrast, the staining of GDF-9 was notably weak or absent in cancer cells of tumour tissues. Similarly, the bladder cancer cell lines RT112 and EJ138, expressed very low levels of GDF-9. Moreover, overexpression of GDF-9 reduced the growth, adhesion and migration of bladder cell lines in vitro. However, the overexpression of GDF-9 had little bearing on the invasion of bladder cell lines in vitro. In conclusion, GDF-9 is expressed at lower levels in human bladder cancer cells compared with normal transitional cells of the bladder. GDF-9 levels are inversely correlated with the growth, adhesion and migration of bladder cancer cells in vitro. The results of the present study suggest that GDF-9 is a potential tumour suppressor in human bladder cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Lee, Sangderk</author><author>Starosta, Vitaliy</author><author>Wu, Tinghuai</author><author>Ho, Tiffany</author><author>Kim, Jin</author><author>Berliner, Judith a</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A role for VEGFR2 activation in endothelial responses caused by barrier disruptive OxPAPC concentrations.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e30957</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22303475</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0030957</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3269437&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Oxidation products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC) differentially modulate endothelial cell (EC) barrier function in a dose-dependent fashion.

In a recent case report, we described fast resolution of pulmonary edema on treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib through an unknown mechanism. Here, we explored the effect of imatinib on endothelial barrier dysfunction and edema formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the effect of imatinib on endothelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. In human macro- and microvascular endothelial monolayers, imatinib attenuated endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin and histamine. Small interfering RNA knock-downs of the imatinib-sensitive kinases revealed that imatinib attenuates endothelial barrier dysfunction via inhibition of Abl-related gene kinase (Arg/Abl2), a previously unknown mediator of endothelial barrier dysfunction. Indeed, Arg was activated by endothelial stimulation with thrombin, histamine, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Imatinib limited Arg-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction by enhancing Rac1 activity and enforcing adhesion of endothelial cells to the extracellular matrix. Using mouse models of vascular leakage as proof-of-concept, we found that pretreatment with imatinib protected against vascular endothelial growth factor-induced vascular leakage in the skin, and effectively prevented edema formation in the lungs. In a murine model of sepsis, imatinib treatment (6 hours and 18 hours after induction of sepsis) attenuated vascular leakage in the kidneys and the lungs (24 hours after induction of sepsis). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, imatinib prevents endothelial barrier dysfunction and edema formation via inhibition of Arg. These findings identify imatinib as a promising approach to permeability edema and indicate Arg as novel target for edema treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Rijssel, Jos</author><author>Hoogenboezem, Mark</author><author>Wester, Lynn</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>Van Buul, Jaap D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The N-terminal DH-PH domain of Trio induces cell spreading and migration by regulating lamellipodia dynamics in a Rac1-dependent fashion.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e29912</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Electron</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: antagonists &amp;</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: physiology</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs</keyword><keyword>Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs: physiology</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: antagonists &amp; in</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pseudopodia: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Scanning</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22238672</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0029912</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3253119&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Trio encodes two DH-PH domains that catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rac1, RhoG and RhoA. The N-terminal DH-PH domain is known to activate Rac1 and RhoG, whereas the C-terminal DH-PH domain can activate RhoA. The current study shows that the N-terminal DH-PH domain, upon expression in HeLa cells, activates Rac1 and RhoG independently from each other. In addition, we show that the flanking SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich region of the C-terminus of Rac1, but not of RhoG. However, this SH3 domain is not required for Rac1 or RhoG GDP-GTP exchange. Rescue experiments in Trio-shRNA-expressing cells showed that the N-terminal DH-PH domain of Trio, but not the C-terminal DH-PH domain, restored fibronectin-mediated cell spreading and migration defects that are observed in Trio-silenced cells. Kymograph analysis revealed that the N-terminal DH-PH domain, independent of its SH3 domain, controls the dynamics of lamellipodia. Using siRNA against Rac1 or RhoG, we found that Trio-D1-induced lamellipodia formation required Rac1 but not RhoG expression.

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β is central to neuroinflammation and contributes to brain microvascular leakage and edema formation. Although it is well known that IL-1β exposure directly induces hyperpermeability in brain microvascular endothelium, the molecular mechanisms mediating this response are not completely understood. In the present study, we found that exposure of the human brain microvascular endothelium to IL-1β triggered activation of novel PKC isoforms δ, μ, and θ, followed by decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). The IL-1β-induced decrease in TER was prevented by small hairpin RNA silencing of PKC-θ or by treatment with the isoform-selective PKC inhibitor Gö6976 but not by PKC inhibitors that are selective for all PKC isoforms other than PKC-θ. Decreased TER coincided with increased phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chain and with increased proapoptotic signaling indicated by decreased uptake of mitotracker red in response to IL-1β treatment. However, neither of these observed effects were prevented by Gö6976 treatment, indicating lack of causality with respect to decreased TER. Instead, our data indicated that the mechanism of decreased TER involves PKC-θ-dependent phosphorylation of the tight junction protein zona occludens (ZO)-1. Because IL-1β is a central inflammatory mediator, our interpretation is that inhibition of PKC-θ or inhibition of ZO-1 phosphorylation could be viable strategies for preventing blood-brain barrier dysfunction under a variety of neuroinflammatory conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Xin</author><author>Martin, Tracey A</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COM-1/p8 acts as a tumour growth enhancer in colorectal cancer cell lines.</title><secondary-title>Anticancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>1229-1237</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors: gene</keyword><keyword>Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors: phys</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0030229505338</isbn><accession-num>22493353</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493353</url><url>http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/32/4/1229.short</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Candidate of metastasis-1 (COM-1) is a molecule which is stress-induced and cell growth-related. The current study investigated the impact of COM-1 and role of Peroxisome Proliferating Activator Receptor-gamma (PPARγ) agonists on COM-1 knock down in colorectal cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of COM-1 was knocked out in the colorectal cancer cell lines RKO and CaCO2 by transfection with ribozyme transgenes which specifically targeted COM-1. Cell growth, cell migration and apoptosis were measured in wild-type, control and COM-1 knock down cells. The impact or treatment with the PPARγ agonists on the function of COM-1 knock down cells was monitored. RESULTS: COM-1 knock-down cells grew slower than wild-type and control cells. When treated with the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) at several different concentrations, all types of cells grew slower to some extent. Cells with COM-1 knock-down had the same mobility as wild-type and control cells. More apoptotic and dead cells were detected when cells were treated with ciglitazone at 3 μM, especially of COM-1 knock down cells. CONCLUSION: COM-1 is an anti-apoptotic gene and a cell growth promoter. Furthermore, the PPARγ agonist could increase the inhibitory effect seen in COM-1 knock-down cell growth and to promote apoptosis. In regards to metastasis, COM-1 appears to play no role in cell motility.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosanquet, David C</author><author>Harding, Keith G</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expression of IL-24 and IL-24 receptors in human wound tissues and the biological implications of IL-24 on keratinocytes.</title><secondary-title>Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society</full-title></periodical><pages>896-903</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interleukins</keyword><keyword>Interleukins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries: pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23110359</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1524-475X.2012.00840.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110359</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Interleukin (IL)-24, also known as melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7, is a cytokine initially identified from cancerous cells and expressed in a range of cell types. It is a regulator of cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, and a promising anticancer agent. IL-24 acts via its heterodimic receptors: the IL-20R1 and IL-20R2 complex and the IL-22R1 and IL-20R2 complex. There is limited information on the effect of IL-24 in wound healing. Human acute and chronic wound tissues were used to analyze the transcript levels and histological staining of IL-24 and the IL-24 receptors. The biological response of human keratinocytes to recombinant human IL-24 was evaluated using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing-based methods in conjunction with inhibitors to candidate signaling pathways. IL-24 significantly slowed the migration of keratinocytes (p = 0.01), with only a marginal effect on cellular adhesion. The inhibitory effect of IL-24 on migration was completed reversed following addition of an AKT inhibitor (p = 0.004) but not an SMAD3 pathway inhibitor. Human chronic wound tissues showed raised levels of both IL-24 (p = 0.003) and its receptor (p = 0.0305) compared with acute wound tissues. We conclude that IL-24 appears to promote wound chronicity via its inhibitory effect on the migratory behavior of human keratinocytes, mediated through an AKT-dependent pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Shuo</author><author>Yu, Chuanhui</author><author>Yang, Fan</author><author>Paganini-Hill, Annlia</author><author>Fisher, Mark J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphodiesterase inhibitor modulation of brain microvascular endothelial cell barrier properties.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the neurological sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the neurological sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>45-51</pages><volume>320</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Brain: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Brain: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Claudin-5</keyword><keyword>Claudin-5: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dipyridamole</keyword><keyword>Dipyridamole: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Drug Interactions</keyword><keyword>Drug Interactions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Histamine</keyword><keyword>Histamine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoquinolines</keyword><keyword>Isoquinolines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pyrroles</keyword><keyword>Pyrroles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Rolipram</keyword><keyword>Rolipram: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Sulfonamides</keyword><keyword>Sulfonamides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tetrazoles</keyword><keyword>Tetrazoles: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Tetrazoles: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22819056</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jns.2012.06.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3504123&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain microvascular disorders, including cerebral microscopic hemorrhage, have high prevalence but few treatment options. To develop new strategies for these disorders, we analyzed the effects of several phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBECs). METHODS: We modified barrier properties and response to histamine of HBECs using cilostazol (PDE3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor), and dipyridamole (non-specific PDE inhibitor). RESULTS: Cilostazol and dipyridamole altered the distribution of endothelial F-actin. Cilostazol increased expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 by 118% compared to control (p&lt;.001). Permeability to albumin was decreased by cilostazol (21% vs control, p&lt;.05), and permeability to dextran (70Kd) was decreased by both cilostazol (37% vs control, p&lt;.001) and dipyridamole (44% vs control, p&lt;.0001). Cilostazol increased trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) after 12h by 111% compared to control (p&lt;.0001). Protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors H89 and KT5720 attenuated the TEER increase by cilostazol. Transient increased permeability in response to histamine was significantly mitigated by cilostazol, but not by other PDE inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate distinctive effects of cilostazol and other PDE inhibitors on HBECs, including enhanced barrier characteristics and mitigation of response to histamine. PKA-mediated effects of cilostazol were prominent in this model. These in vitro findings are consistent with therapeutic potential of PDE inhibitors in human brain microvascular disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evans, Jason V</author><author>Ammer, Amanda G</author><author>Jett, John E</author><author>Bolcato, Chris a</author><author>Breaux, Jason C</author><author>Martin, Karen H</author><author>Culp, Mark V</author><author>Gannett, Peter M</author><author>Weed, Scott a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Src binds cortactin through an SH2 domain cystine-mediated linkage.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>6185-6197</pages><volume>125</volume><issue>Pt 24</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cortactin</keyword><keyword>Cortactin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cortactin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cystine</keyword><keyword>Cystine: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cystine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Molecular</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>cortactin</keyword><keyword>cystine</keyword><keyword>sh2 domain</keyword><keyword>src</keyword><keyword>src Homology Domains</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23097045</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.121046</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23097045</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3585525&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Migration;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Tyrosine-kinase-based signal transduction mediated by modular protein domains is critical for cellular function. The Src homology (SH)2 domain is an important conductor of intracellular signaling that binds to phosphorylated tyrosines on acceptor proteins, producing molecular complexes responsible for signal relay. Cortactin is a cytoskeletal protein and tyrosine kinase substrate that regulates actin-based motility through interactions with SH2-domain-containing proteins. The Src kinase SH2 domain mediates cortactin binding and tyrosine phosphorylation, but how Src interacts with cortactin is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Src binds cortactin through cystine bonding between Src C185 in the SH2 domain within the phosphotyrosine binding pocket and cortactin C112/246 in the cortactin repeats domain, independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Interaction studies show that the presence of reducing agents ablates Src-cortactin binding, eliminates cortactin phosphorylation by Src, and prevents Src SH2 domain binding to cortactin. Tandem MS/MS sequencing demonstrates cystine bond formation between Src C185 and cortactin C112/246. Mutational studies indicate that an intact cystine binding interface is required for Src-mediated cortactin phosphorylation, cell migration, and pre-invadopodia formation. Our results identify a novel phosphotyrosine-independent binding mode between the Src SH2 domain and cortactin. Besides Src, one quarter of all SH2 domains contain cysteines at or near the analogous Src C185 position. This provides a potential alternative mechanism to tyrosine phosphorylation for cysteine-containing SH2 domains to bind cognate ligands that may be widespread in propagating signals regulating diverse cellular functions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Ji, Ke</author><author>Frewer, Natasha</author><author>Ji, Jiafu</author><author>Mason, Malcolm D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibitory effects of Yangzheng Xiaoji on angiogenesis and the role of the focal adhesion kinase pathway.</title><secondary-title>International journal of oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>1635-1642</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiogenesis Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Angiogenesis Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Angiogenesis Inhibitors: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chinese Herbal</keyword><keyword>Chinese Herbal: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Drug Synergism</keyword><keyword>Drugs</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: antagonis</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolis</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: drug effec</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Physiologic</keyword><keyword>Physiologic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22971748</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijo.2012.1627</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22971748</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Angiogenesis is an essential event during the excessive growth and metastatic spread of solid tumours. Anti-angiogenic agents have become a new choice of therapy for patients with cancer. In the present study, we investigated the potential effect of Yangzheng Xiaoji, a traditional Chinese medicinal formula presently used in the treatment of several solid tumours including liver cancer and gastric cancer, on angiogenesis, in vitro. The human vascular endothelial cell line HECV was used. A Matrigel-based sandwich tubule formation assay was employed to assess in vitro angiogenesis, a colorimetric method for assessing in vitro cell growth. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used to evaluate the adhesion and migration of endothelial cells. The effects on activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were evaluated using western blotting and immunofluorescence methods. Yangzhen Xiaoji extract DME25 significantly inhibited tube formation (p=0.046 vs control). This was seen together with a concentration-dependent inhibition on cell-matrix adhesion and cellular migration. It was demonstrated that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF557328 had a significant synergistic effect on DME25-induced inhibition of cell adhesion, migration and tube formation. The study showed that DME25 inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK in endothelial cells. In conclusion, Yangzhen Xiaoji has a marked effect on angiogenesis, in vitro and that this effect is at least partly mediated by the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simet, Samantha M</author><author>Wyatt, Todd a</author><author>DeVasure, Jane</author><author>Yanov, Daniel</author><author>Allen-Gipson, Diane</author><author>Sisson, Joseph H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alcohol increases the permeability of airway epithelial tight junctions in Beas-2B and NHBE cells.</title><secondary-title>Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research</full-title></periodical><pages>432-442</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Carbazoles</keyword><keyword>Carbazoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Claudin-1</keyword><keyword>Claudin-5</keyword><keyword>Claudins</keyword><keyword>Claudins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Drug Interactions</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Ethanol</keyword><keyword>Ethanol: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Ethanol: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Ethanol: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transformed</keyword><keyword>Zonula Occludens-1 Protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21950588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01640.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3251733&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Tight junctions form a continuous belt-like structure between cells and act to regulate paracellular signaling. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to regulate tight junction assembly and disassembly and is activated by alcohol. Previous research has shown that alcohol increases the permeability of tight junctions in lung alveolar cells. However, little is known about alcohol's effect on tight junctions in epithelium of the conducting airways. We hypothesized that long-term alcohol exposure reduces zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1 localization at the cell membrane and increases permeability through a PKC-dependent mechanism. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we exposed normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, cells from a human bronchial epithelial transformed cell line (Beas-2B), and Beas-2B expressing a PKCα dominant negative (DN) to alcohol (20, 50, and 100 mM) for up to 48 hours. Immunofluorescence was used to assess changes in ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-5, and claudin-7 localization. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing was used to measure the permeability of tight junctions between monolayers of NHBE, Beas-2B, and DN cells. RESULTS: Alcohol increased tight junction permeability in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-5, and claudin-7 localization at the cell membrane. To determine a possible signaling mechanism, we measured the activity of PKC isoforms (alpha, delta, epsilon, and zeta). PKCα activity significantly increased in Beas-2B cells from 1 to 6 hours of 100 mM alcohol exposure, while PKCζ activity significantly decreased at 1 hour and increased at 3 hours. Inhibiting PKCα with Gö-6976 prevented the alcohol-induced protein changes in both ZO-1 and claudin-1 at the cell membrane. PKCα DN Beas-2B cells were resistant to alcohol-induced protein alterations. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that alcohol disrupts ZO-1, claudin-1, claudin-5, and claudin-7 through the activation of PKCα, leading to an alcohol-induced &quot;leakiness&quot; in bronchial epithelial cells. Such alcohol-induced airway-leak state likely contributes to the impaired airway host defenses associated with acute and chronic alcohol ingestion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weissmann, Norbert</author><author>Sydykov, Akylbek</author><author>Kalwa, Hermann</author><author>Storch, Ursula</author><author>Fuchs, Beate</author><author>Mederos y Schnitzler, Michael</author><author>Brandes, Ralf P</author><author>Grimminger, Friedrich</author><author>Meissner, Marcel</author><author>Freichel, Marc</author><author>Offermanns, Stefan</author><author>Veit, Florian</author><author>Pak, Oleg</author><author>Krause, Karl-Heinz</author><author>Schermuly, Ralph T</author><author>Brewer, Alison C</author><author>Schmidt, Harald H H W</author><author>Seeger, Werner</author><author>Shah, Ajay M</author><author>Gudermann, Thomas</author><author>Ghofrani, Hossein a</author><author>Dietrich, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activation of TRPC6 channels is essential for lung ischaemia-reperfusion induced oedema in mice.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>649</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Diacylglycerol Kinase</keyword><keyword>Diacylglycerol Kinase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Edema</keyword><keyword>Edema: pathology</keyword><keyword>Edema: therapy</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: pathology</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Phospholipase C gamma</keyword><keyword>Phospholipase C gamma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reperfusion Injury</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels: genetics</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>22337127</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms1660</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3272568&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Lung ischaemia-reperfusion-induced oedema (LIRE) is a life-threatening condition that causes pulmonary oedema induced by endothelial dysfunction. Here we show that lungs from mice lacking nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox2(y/-)) or the classical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6(-/-)) are protected from LIR-induced oedema (LIRE). Generation of chimeric mice by bone marrow cell transplantation and endothelial-specific Nox2 deletion showed that endothelial Nox2, but not leukocytic Nox2 or TRPC6, are responsible for LIRE. Lung endothelial cells from Nox2- or TRPC6-deficient mice showed attenuated ischaemia-induced Ca(2+) influx, cellular shape changes and impaired barrier function. Production of reactive oxygen species was completely abolished in Nox2(y/-) cells. A novel mechanistic model comprising endothelial Nox2-derived production of superoxide, activation of phospholipase C-γ, inhibition of diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase, DAG-mediated activation of TRPC6 and ensuing LIRE is supported by pharmacological and molecular evidence. This mechanism highlights novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of LIRE.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Srinivas, Sangly P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell signaling in regulation of the barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium.</title><secondary-title>Experimental eye research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental eye research</full-title></periodical><pages>8-15</pages><volume>95</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cornea</keyword><keyword>Cornea: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: metabolism</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21963716</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2011.09.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3271188&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium, which is conferred by its tight and adherens junctions, is critical for the maintenance of deturgescence of the corneal stroma. Although characteristically leaky, the barrier integrity restricts fluid leakage into the stroma such that the rate of leak does not exceed the rate of the endothelial active fluid transport directed toward the aqueous humor. At a molecular level, the barrier integrity is influenced by the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules, which are coupled to tight and adherens junctions via a variety of linker proteins. Since the cytoskeleton is affected by Rho family small GTPases and p38 MAP kinase, among others, many pathophysiological stimuli induce plasticity to the cytoskeleton and thereby elicit dynamic regulation of the barrier integrity. This review presents an overview of the impact of several bioactive factors on the barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium through altered actin cytoskeleton and/or disassembly of microtubules. The main focus is on the effect of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) which is a pro-inflammatory molecule found in the intraocular milieu during allograft rejection and anterior uveitis. This cytokine elicits acute activation of p38 MAP kinase, induces disassembly of microtubules, disrupts the peri-junctional actomyosin ring, and concomitantly breaks down the barrier integrity. These effects of TNF-α could be inhibited by stabilizing the microtubules, co-treating with a selective p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, and elevating intracellular cAMP via A2B receptors or direct exposure to forskolin. Overall, the corneal edema following a potential breakdown of the endothelial barrier integrity can be rescued pharmacologically by inhibiting specific cell-signaling mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngok, Siu P</author><author>Geyer, Rory</author><author>Liu, Miaoliang</author><author>Kourtidis, Antonis</author><author>Agrawal, Sudesh</author><author>Wu, Chuanshen</author><author>Seerapu, Himabindu Reddy</author><author>Lewis-Tuffin, Laura J</author><author>Moodie, Karen L</author><author>Huveldt, Deborah</author><author>Marx, Ruth</author><author>Baraban, Jay M</author><author>Storz, Peter</author><author>Horowitz, Arie</author><author>Anastasiadis, Panos Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VEGF and Angiopoietin-1 exert opposing effects on cell junctions by regulating the Rho GEF Syx.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1103-1115</pages><volume>199</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiopoietin-1</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-1: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Left</keyword><keyword>Left: genetics</keyword><keyword>Left: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Left: pathology</keyword><keyword>Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Post-Translational</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Processing</keyword><keyword>Protein Stability</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Stroke Volume</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: physiology</keyword><keyword>Ventricular Dysfunction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23253477</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.201207009</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3529520&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ang1 (Angiopoietin-1) have opposing effects on vascular permeability, but the molecular basis of these effects is not fully known. We report in this paper that VEGF and Ang1 regulate endothelial cell (EC) junctions by determining the localization of the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx. Syx was recruited to junctions by members of the Crumbs polarity complex and promoted junction integrity by activating Diaphanous. VEGF caused translocation of Syx from cell junctions, promoting junction disassembly, whereas Ang1 maintained Syx at the junctions, inducing junction stabilization. The VEGF-induced translocation of Syx from EC junctions was caused by PKD1 (protein kinase D1)-mediated phosphorylation of Syx at Ser(806), which reduced Syx association to its junctional anchors. In support of the pivotal role of Syx in regulating EC junctions, syx(-/-) mice had defective junctions, resulting in vascular leakiness, edema, and impaired heart function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Lei</author><author>Le Bras, Alexandra</author><author>Sacharidou, Anastasia</author><author>Itagaki, Kiyoshi</author><author>Zhan, Yumei</author><author>Kondo, Maiko</author><author>Carman, Christopher V</author><author>Davis, George E</author><author>Aird, William C</author><author>Oettgen, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ETS-related gene (ERG) controls endothelial cell permeability via transcriptional regulation of the claudin 5 (CLDN5) gene.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>6582-6591</pages><volume>287</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoviridae</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae: genetics</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Claudins</keyword><keyword>Claudins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels</keyword><keyword>Coronary Vessels: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: cytology</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Site-Directed</keyword><keyword>Trans-Activators</keyword><keyword>Trans-Activators: genetics</keyword><keyword>Trans-Activators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22235125</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M111.300236</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235125</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3307294&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>ETS-related gene (ERG) is a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Our previous studies have shown that ERG expression is highly enriched in endothelial cells (EC) both in vitro and in vivo. ERG expression is markedly repressed in response to inflammatory stimuli. It has been shown that ERG is a positive regulator of several EC-restricted genes including VE-cadherin, endoglin, and von Willebrand factor, and a negative regulator of other genes such as interleukin (IL)-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. In this study we have identified a novel role for ERG in the regulation of EC barrier function. ERG knockdown results in marked increases in EC permeability. This is associated with a significant increase of stress fiber and gap formation in EC. Furthermore, we identify CLDN5 as a downstream target of ERG in EC. Thus, our results suggest that ERG plays a pivotal role in regulating EC barrier function and that this effect is mediated in part through its regulation of CLDN5 gene expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Konya, Viktoria</author><author>Kampitsch, Nora</author><author>Theiler, Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial E-type prostanoid 4 receptors promote barrier function and inhibit neutrophil trafficking</title><secondary-title>Journal of Allergy and</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Allergy and</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>acute lung</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</keyword><keyword>endothelial barrier</keyword><keyword>injury</keyword><keyword>neutro-</keyword><keyword>prostaglandins</keyword><keyword>vascular leakage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaci.2012.05.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674912007828</url><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674912007828</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yinan</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Zhang, Lijian</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expression Profile of Epithelial Protein Lost in Neoplasm-Alpha ( EPLIN-α ) in Human Pulmonary Cancer and Its Impact on SKMES-1 Cells in Vitro</title></titles><periodical/><volume>2012</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>eplin-α</keyword><keyword>pulmonary cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><urls/></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Ping-Hui</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Mason, Malcolm D</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein tyrosine phosphatase µ (PTP µ or PTPRM), a negative regulator of proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, is associated with disease prognosis.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e50183</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23185569</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0050183</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3502354&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PTPRM has been shown to exhibit homophilic binding and confer cell-cell adhesion in cells including epithelial and cancer cells.

Our study aims at: (1) deriving and validating a mathematical model for cell growth, and (2) quantitatively detecting and analyzing the biological interdependencies across multiple observational scales with a variety of time and frequency resolutions. This research was conducted using the time series data practically measured from a novel on-line cell monitoring technique, referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), which allows continuously tracking the cellular behavior such as adhesion, proliferation, spreading and micromotion. First, comparing our ECIS-based cellular growth modeling analysis results with those determined by hematocytometer measurement using different time intervals, we found that the results obtained from both experimental methods consistently agreed. However, our study demonstrated that it is much easier and more convenient to operate with the ECIS system for on-line cellular growth monitoring. Secondly, for multi-scale analysis our results showed that the proposed wavelet-based methodology can effectively quantify the fluctuations associated with cell micromotions and quantitatively capture the biological interdependencies across multiple observational scales. Note that although the wavelet method is well known, its application into the ECIS time series analysis is novel and unprecedented in computational cell biology. Our analyses indicated that the proposed study on ECIS time series could provide a hopeful start and great potentials in both modeling and elucidating the complex mechanisms of cell biological systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Starosta, Vitaliy</author><author>Wu, Tinghuai</author><author>Zimman, Alejandro</author><author>Pham, Donald</author><author>Tian, Xinyong</author><author>Oskolkova, Olga</author><author>Bochkov, Valery</author><author>Berliner, Judith a</author><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Regulation of Endothelial Cell Permeability by High and Low Doses of Oxidized 1-Palmitoyl-2-Arachidonyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>331-341</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>oxidized phospholipids</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>protein tyrosine</keyword><keyword>ve-cadherin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>21997484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2011-0153OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997484</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>The generation of phospholipid oxidation products in atherosclerosis, sepsis, and lung pathologies affects endothelial barrier function, which exerts significant consequences on disease outcomes in general. Our group previously showed that oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OxPAPC) at low concentrations increases endothelial cell (EC) barrier function, but decreases it at higher concentrations. In this study, we determined the mechanisms responsible for the pulmonary endothelial cell barrier dysfunction induced by high OxPAPC concentrations. OxPAPC at a range of 5-20 μg/ml enhanced EC barriers, as indicated by increased transendothelial electrical resistance. In contrast, higher OxPAPC concentrations (50-100 μg/ml) rapidly increased EC permeability, which was accompanied by increased total cell protein tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation, phosphorylation at Tyr-418, the activation of Src kinase, and the phosphorylation of adherens junction (AJ) protein vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) at Tyr-731 and Tyr-658, which was not observed in ECs stimulated with low OxPAPC doses. The early tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was linked to the dissociation of VE-cadherin-p120-catenin/β-catenin complexes and VE-cadherin internalization, whereas low OxPAPC doses promoted the formation of VE-cadherin-p120-catenin/β-catenin complexes. High but not low doses of OxPAPC increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein oxidation. The inhibition of Src by PP2 and ROS production by N-acetyl cysteine inhibited the disassembly of VE-cadherin-p120-catenin complexes, and attenuated high OxPAPC-induced EC barrier disruption. These results show the differential effects of OxPAPC doses on VE-cadherin-p120-catenin complex assembly and EC barrier function. These data suggest that the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and other potential targets mediated by Src and ROS-dependent mechanisms plays a key role in the dissociation of AJ complexes and EC barrier dysfunction induced by high OxPAPC doses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jin</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Kynaston, Howard G</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Repulsive guidance molecules, novel bone morphogenetic protein co-receptors, are key regulators of the growth and aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>International journal of oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>544-550</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors</keyword><keyword>Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion Molecules</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class I</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class I: genetics</keyword><keyword>Histocompatibility Antigens Class I: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1</keyword><keyword>Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1: genetics</keyword><keyword>Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neuronal</keyword><keyword>Neuronal: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neuronal: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Smad1 Protein</keyword><keyword>Smad1 Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Smad3 Protein</keyword><keyword>Smad3 Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22076499</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijo.2011.1251</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076499</url><url>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sp/ijo/2012/00000040/00000002/art00025</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family members RGMA, RGMB and RGMC are GPI-linked membrane proteins recently identified as co-receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMPs are a group of proteins enriched in bone and play important roles in prostate cancer. The current study aimed to investigate roles played by RGMs in prostate cancer. Expression of RGMs was examined in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Knockdown of each RGM in prostate cancer cells was performed using the respective anti-RGMA, RGMB and RGMC transgenes. A variety of in vitro function tests were employed to analyze the influence on cancer cell functions by RGM knockdown. The implications of RGM knockdown in BMP signalling were also examined using both Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. Knockdown of RGMA had no effect on cell growth, migration and invasion, but promoted cell-matrix adhesion. Knockdown of RGMB and RGMC increased growth and adhesion, but only RGMB knockdown increased capacities of migration and invasion in PC-3 cells. Further investigations showed an increase in Smad-3 activation and reduced levels of Smad-1 in PC-3 cells by RGMB and RGMC knockdown, and also an up-regulation of ID1, a BMP target gene particularly in exposure to BMP7. RGMs play inhibitory roles in prostate cancer by suppressing cell growth, adhesion, migration and invasion. RGMs can coordinate Smad-dependent signalling of BMPs in prostate cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nagalingam, Arumugam</author><author>Arbiser, Jack L</author><author>Bonner, Michael Y</author><author>Saxena, Neeraj K</author><author>Sharma, Dipali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Honokiol activates AMP-activated protein kinase in breast cancer cells via LKB1-dependent pathway and inhibits breast carcinogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Breast cancer research : BCR</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast cancer research : BCR</full-title></periodical><pages>R35</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central Ltd</publisher><accession-num>22353783</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/bcr3128</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22353783</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Honokiol, a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from magnolia species, is widely known for its therapeutic potential as an anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombosis, anti-oxidant agent and more recently for its protective function in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we sought to examine the effectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Clonogenicity and 3D-colony formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell growth upon honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was evaluated by utilizing matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine activation of Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast cancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in biological effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis of tumors were used. RESULTS: Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity as evident by increased phosphorylation of downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Using AMPK-null and AMPK-WT (MEFs); we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and more importantly, inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of tumors showed significant increase in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and phospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data provide first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of LKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol mediated inhibition of invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><secondary-authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing and Cancer Metastasis</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Dordrecht</pub-location><publisher>Springer Netherlands</publisher><isbn>978-94-007-4926-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-94-007-4927-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.springerlink.com/index/10.1007/978-94-007-4927-6</url><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-4927-6</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xie, Zhihui</author><author>Ghosh, Chandra C</author><author>Patel, Roshni</author><author>Iwaki, Shoko</author><author>Gaskins, Donna</author><author>Nelson, Celeste</author><author>Jones, Nina</author><author>Greipp, Philip R</author><author>Parikh, Samir M</author><author>Druey, Kirk M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vascular endothelial hyperpermeability induces the clinical symptoms of Clarkson disease (the systemic capillary leak syndrome).</title><secondary-title>Blood</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Blood</full-title></periodical><pages>4321-4332</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-2</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-2: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-2: blood</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Leak Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Capillary Leak Syndrome: blood</keyword><keyword>Capillary Leak Syndrome: etiology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Leak Syndrome: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Convalescence</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cultured: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humanized</keyword><keyword>Humanized: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoglobulins</keyword><keyword>Intravenous</keyword><keyword>Intravenous: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Paraproteinemias</keyword><keyword>Paraproteinemias: blood</keyword><keyword>Paraproteinemias: complications</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: antagonists</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: blood</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: genetics</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiopathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22411873</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1182/blood-2011-08-375816</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3359743&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis</label><abstract>The systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is a rare disorder characterized by transient episodes of hypotensive shock and anasarca thought to arise from reversible microvascular barrier dysfunction. Although the high prevalence of a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance in SCLS suggests a pathogenic contribution of endogenous immunoglobulins, the mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability remain obscure. Herein, we report clinical and molecular findings on 23 patients, the largest SCLS case series to date. Application of episodic SCLS sera, but neither the purified immunoglobulin fraction nor sera obtained from patients during remission, to human microvascular endothelial cells caused vascular endothelial cadherin internalization, disruption of interendothelial junctions, actin stress fiber formation, and increased permeability in complementary functional assays without inducing endothelial apoptosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, one promising therapy for SCLS, mitigated the permeability effects of episodic sera. Consistent with the presence of endogenous, nonimmunoglobulin, circulating permeability factor(s) constrained to SCLS episodes, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), were elevated in episodic SCLS sera but not in remission sera. Ab-based inhibition of Ang2 counteracted permeability induced by episodic SCLS sera. Comparable experiments with anti-VEGF Ab (bevacizumab) yielded less interpretable results, probably because of endothelial toxicity of VEGF withdrawal. Our results support a model of SCLS pathogenesis in which nonimmunoglobulin humoral factors such as VEGF and Ang2 contribute to transient endothelial contraction, suggesting a molecular mechanism for this highly lethal disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernández-Martín, Laura</author><author>Marcos-Ramiro, Beatriz</author><author>Bigarella, Carolina L</author><author>Graupera, Mariona</author><author>Cain, Robert J</author><author>Reglero-Real, Natalia</author><author>Jiménez, Anaïs</author><author>Cernuda-Morollón, Eva</author><author>Correas, Isabel</author><author>Cox, Susan</author><author>Ridley, Anne J</author><author>Millán, Jaime</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crosstalk between reticular adherens junctions and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 regulates endothelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e90-e102</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22723439</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.252080</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723439</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Endothelial cells provide a barrier between the blood and tissues, which is reduced during inflammation to allow selective passage of molecules and cells.

Tight Junctions (TJ) are located between the cancer epithelial cells and between the endothelial cells functioning in an adhesive manner. They represent a critical barrier which the cancer cells must overcome in order to penetrate and initiate metastasis. Claudin-5 is a protein member of the Claudin family, a group of TJ proteins expressed in both endothelial and epithelial cells. This study examined in vitro the effect of altering levels of expression of Claudin-5 in HECV cells. Insertion of Claudin-5 gene in HECV cells resulted in cells that were significantly less motile and less adhesive to matrix (P &lt; 0.001). These cells also exhibited a significant decreased in the angiogenic potential (P &lt; 0.001). Results also revealed a link between Claudin-5 and cell motility. Furthermore, a possible link between Claudin-5 and N-WASP, and Claudin-5 and ROCK was demonstrated when interactions between these proteins were seen in the cell line. Moreover, followed by treatment of N-WASP inhibitor (Wiskostatin) and ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), cell motility and angiogenic potential were assessed in response to the inhibitors. Results showed that the knockdown of Claudin-5 in HECV cells masked their response to both N-WASP and ROCK inhibitors. In conclusion, this study portrays a new and interesting role for Claudin-5 in cell motility involving the N-WASP and ROCK signalling cascade which is beyond the primarily role of Claudin-5 in keeping the cell barrier tight as it was originally reported.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yinan</author><author>Sanders, A J Andrew J</author><author>Zhang, Lijian</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EPLIN-Î± Expression in Human Oesophageal Cancer and its Impact on Cellular Aggressiveness and Clinical Outcome</title><secondary-title>Anticancer …</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer …</full-title></periodical><pages>1283-1289</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>EPLINα</keyword><keyword>Esophageal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Esophageal Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Esophageal Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>eplin-α</keyword><keyword>oesophageal cancer</keyword><keyword>pulmonary cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0030229505338</isbn><accession-num>22493360</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/32/4/1283.short</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493360</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epithelial protein lost in neoplasm-α (EPLIN-α) is a cytoskeletal protein whose expression is often lost or is aberrant in cancerous cells and tissues and whose loss is believed to be involved in aggressive phenotype.

Thus a complete understanding of physical processes involved in the formation of an electric double layer is required to design a low interface impedance device. This paper presents the numerical simulation of the impedance for the electrode/electrolyte interface of three-electrode devices along with the practical realization for the effective workout of impedance sensing devices. The three-electrode based impedance sensing devices along with phosphate buffered saline as electrolyte is simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the impedance of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Microfabrication technology is used to realize three-electrode impedance sensing devices with diverse configuration which are used to measure the electrode/electrolyte interface impedance. The measured impedance data were then compared with the COMSOL simulated results and it is found that both the data sets fitted well with less than 5 % RSE. The results obtained from simulation and experiments indicate that the impedance due to double layer diffusion dominates in the low frequency region up to few kHz whereas electrolytic bulk resistance plays a major role in the higher frequency range. The experimental impedance data were further interpreted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis software to model the equivalent circuit of the electrochemical system.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sundivakkam, Premanand C</author><author>Freichel, Marc</author><author>Singh, Vandana</author><author>Yuan, Joseph P</author><author>Vogel, Stephen M</author><author>Flockerzi, Veit</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Ca(2+) sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is necessary and sufficient for the store-operated Ca(2+) entry function of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 1 and 4 channels in endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Molecular pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>510-526</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Glycoproteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22210847</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1124/mol.111.074658</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3310414&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>We addressed the requirement for stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-sensor, and Orai1, a Ca(2+) selective channel, in regulating Ca(2+) entry through the store-operated channels mouse transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 4 or human TRPC1. Studies were made using murine and human lung endothelial cells (ECs) challenged with thrombin known to induce Ca(2+) entry via TRPC1/4. Deletion or knockdown of TRPC4 abolished Ca(2+) entry secondary to depletion of ER Ca(2+) stores, preventing the disruption of the endothelial barrier. Knockdown of STIM1 (but not of Orai1or Orai3) or expression of the dominant-negative STIM1(K684E-K685E) mutant in ECs also suppressed Ca(2+) entry secondary to store depletion. Ectopic expression of WT-STIM1 or WT-Orai1 in TRPC4(-/-)-ECs failed to rescue Ca(2+) entry; however, WT-TRPC4 expression in TRPC4(-/-)-ECs restored Ca(2+) entry indicating the requirement for TRPC4 in mediating store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Moreover, expression of the dominant-negative Orai1(R91W) mutant or Orai3(E81W) mutant in WT-ECs failed to prevent thrombin-induced Ca(2+) entry. In contrast, expression of the dominant-negative TRPC4(EE647-648KK) mutant in WT-ECs markedly reduced thrombin-induced Ca(2+) entry. In ECs expressing YFP-STIM1, ER-store Ca(2+) depletion induced formation of fluorescent membrane puncta in WT but not in TRPC4(-/-) cells, indicating that mobilization of STIM1 and engagement of its Ca(2+) sensing function required TRPC4 expression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed coupling of TRPC1 and TRPC4 with STIM1 on depletion of ER Ca(2+) stores. Thus, TRPC1 and TRPC4 can interact with STIM1 to form functional store-operated Ca(2+)-entry channels, which are essential for mediating Ca(2+) entry-dependent disruption of the endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>YE, L I N</author><author>JI, K E</author><author>FREWER, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of Yangzheng Xiaoji on the Adhesion and Migration of Human Cancer Cells: the Role of the AKT Signalling Pathway</title><secondary-title>Anticancer …</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer …</full-title></periodical><pages>2537-2543</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>AKT</keyword><keyword>Cancer cells</keyword><keyword>ECIS</keyword><keyword>PI3K.</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cellular migration</keyword><keyword>osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>prostate cancer</keyword><keyword>signal transduction pathways</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0030229505338</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/32/7/2537.short</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tai, Yun-Yuan</author><author>Chen, Rung-Shu</author><author>Lin, Yi</author><author>Ling, Thai-Yen</author><author>Chen, Min-Huey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FGF-9 accelerates epithelial invagination for ectodermal organogenesis in real time bioengineered organ manipulation.</title><secondary-title>Cell communication and signaling : CCS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell communication and signaling : CCS</full-title></periodical><pages>34</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>combined bioengineered organ-ecis model</keyword><keyword>ectodermal organogenesis</keyword><keyword>epithelial invagination</keyword><keyword>fgf-9</keyword><keyword>fgf-bmp balancing system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23176204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1478-811X-10-34</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3515343&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Growth</label><abstract>ABSTRACT:</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pietrosimone, Kathryn M</author><author>Yin, Xiuyin</author><author>Knecht, David A</author><author>Lynes, Michael a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement of Cellular Chemotaxis with ECIS/Taxis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</full-title></periodical><pages>2-7</pages><issue>62</issue><keywords><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CXCL12</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CXCL12: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Chemotactic Factors</keyword><keyword>Chemotactic Factors: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte</keyword><keyword>Sepharose</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22491349</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/3840</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (

A common method to measure chemotaxis is the Boyden chamber assay, in which cells and chemoattractant are separated by a porous membrane. As cells migrate through the membrane toward the chemoattractant, they adhere to the underside of the membrane, or fall into the underlying media, and are subsequently stained and visually counted (1). In this method, cells are exposed to a steep and transient chemoattractant gradient, which is thought to be a poor representation of gradients found in tissues (2). Another assay system, the under-agarose chemotaxis assay, (3, 4) measures cell movement across a solid substrate in a thin aqueous film that forms under the agarose layer. The gradient that develops in the agarose is shallow and is thought to be an appropriate representation of naturally occurring gradients. Chemotaxis can be evaluated by microscopic imaging of the distance traveled. Both the Boyden chamber assay and the under-agarose assay are usually configured as endpoint assays. The automated ECIS/Taxis system combines the under-agarose approach with Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) (5, 6). In this assay, target electrodes are located in each of 8 chambers. A large counter-electrode runs through each of the 8 chambers (Figure 2). Each chamber is filled with agarose and two small wells are the cut in the agarose on either side of the target electrode. One well is filled with the test cell population, while the other holds the sources of diffusing chemoattractant (Figure 3). Current passed through the system can be used to determine the change in resistance that occurs as cells pass over the target electrode. Cells on the target electrode increase the resistance of the system (6). In addition, rapid fluctuations in the resistance represent changes in the interactions of cells with the electrode surface and are indicative of ongoing cellular shape changes. The ECIS/Taxis system can measure movement of the cell population in real-time over extended periods of time, but is also sensitive enough to detect the arrival of a single cell at the target electrode. Dictyostelium discoidium is known to migrate in the presence of a folate gradient (7, 8) and its chemotactic response can be accurately measured by ECIS/Taxis (9). Leukocyte chemotaxis, in response to SDF1α and to chemotaxis antagonists has also been measured with ECIS/Taxis (10, 11). An example of the leukocyte response to SDF1α is shown in Figure 1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aikio, Mari</author><author>Alahuhta, Ilkka</author><author>Nurmenniemi, Sini</author><author>Suojanen, Juho</author><author>Palovuori, Riitta</author><author>Teppo, Susanna</author><author>Sorsa, Timo</author><author>López-Otín, Carlos</author><author>Pihlajaniemi, Taina</author><author>Salo, Tuula</author><author>Heljasvaara, Ritva</author><author>Nyberg, Pia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arresten, a collagen-derived angiogenesis inhibitor, suppresses invasion of squamous cell carcinoma.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e51044</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23227231</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0051044</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3515547&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>The turnover of extracellular matrix liberates various cryptic molecules with novel biological activity. Among these are the collagen-derived anti-angiogenic fragments, some of which are suggested to affect carcinoma cells also directly. Arresten is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that is derived from the non-collagenous domain of the basement membrane collagen IV α1 chain. As the mere prevention of tumor angiogenesis leads to hypoxia that can result in selection of more aggressive cell types and reduces the efficacy of chemotherapy, we aimed here to elucidate how arresten influences the aggressive human carcinoma cells. Arresten efficiently inhibited migration and invasion of HSC-3 tongue carcinoma cells in culture and in an organotypic model. Subcutaneous Arr-HSC xenografts grew markedly more slowly in nude mice and showed reduced tumor cell proliferation, vessel density and local invasiveness. In the organotypic assay, HSC-3 cells overproducing arresten (Arr-HSC) showed induction of cell death. In monolayer culture the Arr-HSC cells grew in aggregated cobblestone-like clusters and, relative to the control cells, showed increased expression and localization of epithelial marker E-cadherin in cell-cell contacts. Application of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) further supported our observations on altered morphology and motility of the Arr-HSC cells. Administration of a function-blocking α1 integrin antibody abolished the impedance difference between the Arr-HSC and control cells suggesting that the effect of arresten on promotion of HSC-3 cell-cell contacts and cell spreading is at least partly mediated by α1β1 integrin. Collectively, our data suggest novel roles for arresten in the regulation of oral squamous carcinoma cell proliferation, survival, motility and invasion through the modulation of cell differentiation state and integrin signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xie, Fengbo</author><author>Xu, Youchun</author><author>Wang, Lei</author><author>Mitchelson, Keith</author><author>Xing, Wanli</author><author>Cheng, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of cellular electrical impedance sensing to assess in vitro cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in a human kidney cell nephrotoxicity model.</title><secondary-title>The Analyst</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Analyst</full-title></periodical><pages>1343</pages><volume>137</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antidotes</keyword><keyword>Antidotes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: methods</keyword><keyword>Carboplatin</keyword><keyword>Carboplatin: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Carboplatin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Line: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Glutathione</keyword><keyword>Glutathione: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules: cytology</keyword><keyword>Kidney: cytology</keyword><keyword>Kidney: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Kidney: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thiosulfates</keyword><keyword>Thiosulfates: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22214987</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c2an16141a</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22214987</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Nephrotoxicity is one of the major concerns for anticancer drug safety because most drugs are metabolized and excreted by the kidneys. Convenient tools able to perform rapid in vitro cytotoxicity analysis and identify drug side effects in kidney cells during early phases of drug discovery could be beneficial to drug development programs. Here we developed an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS) capable of continuously measuring the dosage and time response of human proximal tubular epithelial (HK2) cells exposed to four drugs throughout the experimental period. These drugs induced HK2 cell apoptosis/death in a dose-dependent manner, although with very different dose-response effects. DDP (50 μM) was the most cytotoxic and induced obvious HK2 cell apoptosis rapidly after exposure. The other three drugs had much lower cytotoxicity, even at concentrations approaching 1 mM. The results obtained from our ECIS system correlated well with conventional in vitro assays such as flow cytometry and cell viability assays. Notably, the continuous and automatic measurements provided by ECIS system allow for better resolution for drugs with different temporal toxicity profiles. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of DDP's antidotes, glutathione and sodium subsulfite, on DDP-induced cytotoxicity, both of which decreased nephrotoxicity of DDP in a dose-dependent manner. Overall this study illustrates the convenience of ECIS for direct, continuous assessment of the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro. ECIS has the potential to become a useful, non-invasive analytical method for early evaluation of drugs and antidotes of toxins.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hiemstra, Ida H</author><author>Bouma, Gerd</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>Kraal, Georg</author><author>den Haan, Joke M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nod2 improves barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells via enhancement of TLR responses.</title><secondary-title>Molecular immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>264-272</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine</keyword><keyword>Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine: genetics</keyword><keyword>Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine: immunology</keyword><keyword>Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chemokines</keyword><keyword>Chemokines: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease: genetics</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: immunology</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestines</keyword><keyword>Intestines: immunology</keyword><keyword>Intestines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein</keyword><keyword>Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2: genetics</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2: immunology</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 4</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 4: genetics</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 4: immunology</keyword><keyword>Toll-Like Receptor 4: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22750073</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molimm.2012.06.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22750073</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) form a physical barrier between the internal milieu and the intestinal microflora via the expression of tight junctions. TLR-mediated recognition of intestinal microflora by IECs is important for tight junction preservation, production of chemokines, and cell survival. Disturbance of the IEC barrier function results in bacterial invasion and contributes to the development of inflammatory bowel disease. We observed that muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan, strongly enhances subsequent Toll-like receptor (TLR) responses in murine colonic epithelium cell lines. Prior exposure to MDP significantly increased the production of chemokines and cytokines and improved the barrier function induced by different TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. shRNA knock-down studies showed that MDP recognition by Nod2 mediated the enhancement of TLR responses. Our studies indicate that Nod2 stimulation by MDP significantly enhances TLR-mediated IEC barrier function and chemokine production. Failure of this protective mechanism may contribute to the increased risk of Crohn's disease in individuals with a loss-of-function mutation in NOD2.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grinnell, Katie L</author><author>Chichger, Havovi</author><author>Braza, Julie</author><author>Duong, Huetran</author><author>Harrington, Elizabeth O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protection against LPS-induced pulmonary edema through the attenuation of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B oxidation.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>623-632</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Non-Receptor Type 1</keyword><keyword>Non-Receptor Type 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Oxidation-Reduction</keyword><keyword>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema: chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Edema: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22180868</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2011-0271OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180868</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>One hallmark of acute lung injury is the disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier. Such disruption correlates with increased endothelial permeability, partly through the disruption of cell-cell contacts. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are known to affect the stability of both cell-extracellular matrix adhesions and intercellular adherens junctions (AJs). However, evidence for the role of select PTPs in regulating endothelial permeability is limited. Our investigations noted that the inhibition of PTP1B in cultured pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs), as well as in the vasculature of intact murine lungs via the transient overexpression of a catalytically inactive PTP1B, decreased the baseline resistance of cultured EC monolayers and increased the formation of edema in murine lungs, respectively. In addition, we observed that the overexpression of wild-type PTP1B enhanced basal barrier function in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of pulmonary ECs and the coimmunoprecipitation of murine lung homogenates demonstrated the association of PTP1B with the AJ proteins β-catenin, p120-catenin, and VE-cadherin both in vitro and ex vivo. Using LPS in a model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury, we showed that reactive oxygen species were generated in response to LPS, which correlated with enhanced PTP1B oxidation, inhibited phosphatase activity, and attenuation of the interactions between PTP1B and β-catenin, as well as enhanced β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, the overexpression of a cytosolic PTP1B fragment, shown to be resistant to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced oxidase-4 (Nox4)-mediated oxidation, significantly attenuated LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction and the formation of lung edema, and preserved the associations of PTP1B with AJ protein components, independent of PTP1B phosphatase activity. We conclude that PTP1B plays an important role in maintaining the pulmonary endothelial barrier, and PTP1B oxidation appears to contribute to sepsis-induced pulmonary vascular dysfunction, possibly through the disruption of AJs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Doorn, Ruben</author><author>Lopes Pinheiro, Melissa A</author><author>Kooij, Gijs</author><author>Lakeman, Kim</author><author>van het Hof, Bert</author><author>van der Pol, Susanne M A</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>van Horssen, Jack</author><author>van der Valk, Paul</author><author>van der Kam, Elizabeth</author><author>Ronken, Eric</author><author>Reijerkerk, Arie</author><author>de Vries, Helga E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5 mediates the immune quiescence of the human brain endothelial barrier.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neuroinflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neuroinflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>133</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: cytology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: immunology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cellular</keyword><keyword>Cellular: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunity</keyword><keyword>Lentivirus</keyword><keyword>Lentivirus: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: immunology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22715976</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1742-2094-9-133</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3425155&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: The sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator FTY720P (Gilenya®) potently reduces relapse rate and lesion activity in the neuroinflammatory disorder multiple sclerosis. Although most of its efficacy has been shown to be related to immunosuppression through the induction of lymphopenia, it has been suggested that a number of its beneficial effects are related to altered endothelial and blood-brain barrier (BBB) functionality. However, to date it remains unknown whether brain endothelial S1P receptors are involved in the maintenance of the function of the BBB thereby mediating immune quiescence of the brain. Here we demonstrate that the brain endothelial receptor S1P5 largely contributes to the maintenance of brain endothelial barrier function. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of S1P5 in human post-mortem tissues using immunohistochemistry. The function of S1P5 at the BBB was assessed in cultured human brain endothelial cells (ECs) using agonists and lentivirus-mediated knockdown of S1P5. Subsequent analyses of different aspects of the brain EC barrier included the formation of a tight barrier, the expression of BBB proteins and markers of inflammation and monocyte transmigration. RESULTS: We show that activation of S1P5 on cultured human brain ECs by a selective agonist elicits enhanced barrier integrity and reduced transendothelial migration of monocytes in vitro. These results were corroborated by genetically silencing S1P5 in brain ECs. Interestingly, functional studies with these cells revealed that S1P5 strongly contributes to brain EC barrier function and underlies the expression of specific BBB endothelial characteristics such as tight junctions and permeability. In addition, S1P5 maintains the immunoquiescent state of brain ECs with low expression levels of leukocyte adhesion molecules and inflammatory chemokines and cytokines through lowering the activation of the transcription factor NFκB. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that S1P5 in brain ECs contributes to optimal barrier formation and maintenance of immune quiescence of the barrier endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Harding, Keith G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-8 receptors on the migration of human keratinocytes, the role of PLC-γ and potential clinical implications.</title><secondary-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>231-236</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>3</keyword><keyword>belongs to the cxc</keyword><keyword>by the il-8 gene</keyword><keyword>chemokine family</keyword><keyword>chromosome 4q12-q21</keyword><keyword>il-8 has been shown</keyword><keyword>il-8 is a small</keyword><keyword>interleukin-8</keyword><keyword>interleukin-8 receptor</keyword><keyword>protein that is encoded</keyword><keyword>to be linked to</keyword><keyword>which is located on</keyword><keyword>wound healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22969874</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/etm.2011.402</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/etm/3/2/231</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3438606&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Wound Healing</label><abstract>Interleukin (IL)-8 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a direct effect on immune cells, including polymorphonuclear cells. Keratinocytes are a rich source of IL-8. However, there is little knowledge on the role of IL-8 in clinical wound healing and the direct biological effect of IL-8 on keratinocytes. In this study, the effect of recombinant human IL-8 (rhIL-8) on migration and adhesion was tested using HaCaT keratinocytes as a cell model. The cell functions were evaluated using impedance cell sensing. The expression of IL-8 receptor (IL-8R) transcripts in human skin and wounds (acute and chronic) was assessed using real-time transcript analysis. rhIL-8 significantly increased the migration of keratinocytes (3.5±0.3 for cells treated with IL-8 vs. 2.7±0.6 for controls; p=0.029). It is interesting to note that treatment of keratinocytes with IL-8 resulted in a marked shift in the responsive frequencies. IL-8 only resulted in a marginal increase in cell adhesion, which was particularly noticeable at high frequencies. The PLC-γ inhibitor completely eradicated the action of IL-8 on the migration of HaCaT cells. Using real time PCR, it was found that chronic wounds had significantly lower levels of the B form of the IL-8R (IL-8RB) (p=0.045) and marginally lower levels of the A form, IL-8RA, in comparison with acute wounds. Therefore, IL-8 has a direct and profound stimulatory effect on the migration of human keratinocytes, which is likely to occur via the PLC-γ pathway. Together with a reduced level of IL-8Rs in difficult-healing wounds, IL-8 has a clear prognostic and therapeutic value in wound healing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, Jung-Jhih</author><author>Lee, Yen-Hsien</author><author>Wu, Meng-Hsiu</author><author>Yang, Ming-Chien</author><author>Chien, Chiang-Ting</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrospun anti-adhesion barrier made of chitosan alginate for reducing peritoneal adhesions</title><secondary-title>Carbohydrate Polymers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carbohydrate Polymers</full-title></periodical><pages>1304-1312</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.02.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0144861712001361</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bhattacharya, Mallar</author><author>Su, George</author><author>Su, Xiao</author><author>Oses-Prieto, Juan a</author><author>Li, John T</author><author>Huang, Xiaozhu</author><author>Hernandez, Hilda</author><author>Atakilit, Amha</author><author>Burlingame, Alma L</author><author>Matthay, Michael a</author><author>Sheppard, Dean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IQGAP1 is necessary for pulmonary vascular barrier protection in murine acute lung injury and pneumonia.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Here, we used mass spectrometric sequencing of integrin complexes to isolate the novel β3-integrin binding partner IQGAP1. Like integrin β3, IQGAP1 localized to the endothelial cell-cell junction after S1P treatment, and IQGAP1 knockdown prevented cortical actin formation and barrier enhancement in response to S1P. Furthermore, knockdown of IQGAP1 prevented localization of integrin αvβ3 to the cell-cell junction. Similar to β3 null animals, IQGAP1 null mice had increased pulmonary vascular leak compared with wild type controls three days after intratracheal LPS. In an E. coli pneumonia model, IQGAP1 knockout mice had increased lung weights, lung water, and lung extravascular plasma equivalents of 125I-albumin compared with wild type controls. Taken together, these experiments indicate that IQGAP1 is necessary for S1P-mediated vascular barrier protection during acute lung injury and is required for junctional localization of the barrier protective integrin αvβ3.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ungvari, Zoltan</author><author>Tucsek, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Sosnowska, Danuta</author><author>Toth, Peter</author><author>Gautam, Tripti</author><author>Podlutsky, Andrej</author><author>Csiszar, Agnes Anna</author><author>Losonczy, Gyorgy</author><author>Valcarcel-Ares, M Noa</author><author>Sonntag, William E</author><author>Csiszar, Agnes Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aging-Induced Dysregulation of Dicer1-Dependent MicroRNA Expression Impairs Angiogenic Capacity of Rat Cerebromicrovascular Endothelial Cells.</title><secondary-title>The journals of gerontology.

To test the hypothesis that dysregulation of Dicer1 (ribonuclease III, a key enzyme of the microRNA [miRNA] machinery) impairs endothelial angiogenic capacity in aging, primary cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells (CMVECs) were isolated from young (3 months old) and aged (24 months old) Fischer 344 × Brown Norway rats. We found an age-related downregulation of Dicer1 expression both in CMVECs and in small cerebral vessels isolated from aged rats. In aged CMVECs, Dicer1 expression was increased by treatment with polyethylene glycol-catalase. Compared with young cells, aged CMVECs exhibited altered miRNA expression profile, which was associated with impaired proliferation, adhesion to vitronectin, collagen and fibronectin, cellular migration (measured by a wound-healing assay using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology), and impaired ability to form capillary-like structures. Overexpression of Dicer1 in aged CMVECs partially restored miRNA expression profile and significantly improved angiogenic processes. In young CMVECs, downregulation of Dicer1 (siRNA) resulted in altered miRNA expression profile associated with impaired proliferation, adhesion, migration, and tube formation, mimicking the aging phenotype. Collectively, we found that Dicer1 is essential for normal endothelial angiogenic processes, suggesting that age-related dysregulation of Dicer1-dependent miRNA expression may be a potential mechanism underlying impaired angiogenesis and cerebromicrovascular rarefaction in aging.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehta, Rajeshwari R</author><author>Yamada, Tohru</author><author>Taylor, Brad N</author><author>Christov, Konstantin</author><author>King, Marissa L</author><author>Majumdar, Dibyen</author><author>Lekmine, Fatima</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Shilkaitis, Anne</author><author>Bratescu, Laura</author><author>Green, Albert</author><author>Beattie, Craig W</author><author>Das Gupta, Tapas K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A cell penetrating peptide derived from azurin inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth by inhibiting phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, FAK and Akt.</title><secondary-title>Angiogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Angiogenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>355-369</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Azurin</keyword><keyword>Azurin: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Azurin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>CD31</keyword><keyword>CD31: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell-Penetrating Peptides</keyword><keyword>Cell-Penetrating Peptides: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cell-Penetrating Peptides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Nude</keyword><keyword>Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pathologic: pathology</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phase II as Topic</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas aeruginosa: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins: pathology</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2: met</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21667138</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10456-011-9220-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21667138</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>Amino acids 50-77 (p28) of azurin, a 128 aa cupredoxin isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is essentially responsible for azurin's preferential penetration of cancer cells. We now report that p28 also preferentially penetrates human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), co-localized with caveolin-1 and VEGFR-2, and inhibits VEGF- and bFGF-induced migration, capillary tube formation and neoangiogenesis in multiple xenograft models. The antiangiogenic effect of p28 in HUVEC is associated with a dose-related non-competitive inhibition of VEGFR-2 kinase activity. However, unlike other antiangiogenic agents that inhibit the VEGFR-2 kinase, p28 decreased the downstream phosphorylation of FAK and Akt that normally precedes cellular repositioning of the cytoskeletal (F-actin), focal adhesion (FAK and paxillin), and cell to cell junction protein PECAM-1, inhibiting HUVEC motility and migration. The decrease in pFAK and pAkt levels suggests that p28 induces a pFAK-mediated loss of HUVEC motility and migration and a parallel Akt-associated reduction in cell matrix attachment and survival. This novel, direct antiangiogenic effect of p28 on endothelial cells may enhance the cell cycle inhibitory and apoptotic properties of this prototype peptide on tumor cell proliferation as it enters a Phase II clinical trial.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Jiang, David G</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Harding, Keith G</author><author>Patel, Girish K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule impacts on clinical wound healing and inhibits HaCaT migration.</title><secondary-title>International wound journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International wound journal</full-title></periodical><pages>500-507</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule</keyword><keyword>Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule: biosyn</keyword><keyword>Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule: geneti</keyword><keyword>Biopsy</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA: genetics</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Varicose Ulcer</keyword><keyword>Varicose Ulcer: genetics</keyword><keyword>Varicose Ulcer: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Varicose Ulcer: pathology</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21816001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1742-481X.2011.00823.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816001</url></web-urls></urls><label>Wound Healing</label><abstract>Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that has been implicated in the processes of cell adhesion and migration. The current study examines the importance of ALCAM in regulating HaCaT cell growth and migration and its potential to impact on wound healing. ALCAM levels were examined in a range of clinical wound and normal skin samples using Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry. ALCAM expression was targeted in HaCaT keratinocyte cells using a hammerhead ribozyme transgene system. Subsequently, the impact of ALCAM suppression on HaCaT migration and growth was assessed. ALCAM protein was detected mainly in keratinocytes. ALCAM transcript levels were found to be significantly higher in the non-healed chronic wound samples compared with healed samples (P = 0·026). In addition, targeting of ALCAM in HaCaT cells brought about a substantial increase in cellular migration and growth compared with HaCaT control cells.Our results suggest that ALCAM plays an important role in the migration of HaCaT keratinocyte cells. The data also suggests that higher levels of ALCAM may impair healing in chronic wounds. The impact of ALCAM in wound healing may thus be somewhat due to its impact on cell migration and growth.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Wing-Kee</author><author>Torchalski, Blazej</author><author>Kohistani, Naschla</author><author>Thévenod, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ABCB1 protects kidney proximal tubule cells against cadmium-induced apoptosis: roles of cadmium and ceramide transport.</title><secondary-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>343-356</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan</keyword><keyword>4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan: analogs &amp; derivative</keyword><keyword>4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Benzimidazoles</keyword><keyword>Benzimidazoles: diagnostic use</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>Cadmium</keyword><keyword>Cadmium: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Ceramides</keyword><keyword>Ceramides: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclosporins</keyword><keyword>Cyclosporins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: diagnostic use</keyword><keyword>Glucosylceramides</keyword><keyword>Glucosylceramides: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Glucosyltransferases</keyword><keyword>Glucosyltransferases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>Oxadiazoles</keyword><keyword>Oxadiazoles: metabolism</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoproteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)</keyword><keyword>Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor): meta</keyword><keyword>Plasmids</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel: methods</keyword><keyword>Proximal</keyword><keyword>Proximal: cytology</keyword><keyword>Proximal: pathology</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Sphingolipids</keyword><keyword>Sphingolipids: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Transfection: methods</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21436125</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/toxsci/kfr071</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436125</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>Cadmium (Cd(2+)) damages the kidney proximal tubule (PT) by ceramide-dependent apoptosis and is also a class I carcinogen. Multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (MDR1, ABCB1) confers resistance to Cd(2+) apoptosis, and it has been hypothesized that ABCB1 can directly transport Cd(2+) as a mode of cellular protection. Our aim was to investigate the role of ABCB1 in Cd(2+) transport and ceramide apoptosis. In rat PT or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells overexpressing ABCB1, ABCB1-dependent efflux of rhodamine 123(+) (Rh123(+)) or (109)Cd(2+) were determined, and cell death was assayed with MTT, H-33342 nuclear staining, and monolayer integrity by impedance sensing (Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing [ECIS]). ABCB1 inhibitors (PSC833, UIC-2 antibody) did not affect (109)Cd(2+) efflux in PT cells though Rh123(+) transport was blocked. Furthermore, increased ABCB1 expression did not augment (109)Cd(2+) efflux but attenuated apoptosis by 10-50μM Cd(2+) or 5-25μM C(6)-ceramide, which was abolished by PSC833 (1μM). ECIS measurements of ABCB1-MDCK monolayers exhibited similar effects. Moreover, in ABCB1-MDCK cells, Cd(2+)-induced ceramide formation, determined by a diacylglycerol kinase assay, was abolished and increased extrusion of nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD)-C(6)-ceramide, and NBD-C(6)-glucosylceramide was observed compared with MDCK cells. Whereas pharmacological block of sphingomyelin synthase (0.1mM D609) or sphingosine kinase (1μM dimethylsphingosine), which increase the levels of ceramide and its metabolites, augmented Cd(2+)-induced apoptosis, Cd(2+) apoptosis was significantly decreased not only by prevention of de novo ceramide synthesis (0.1μM fumonisin B(1)) but also by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (2μM C(9)DGJ). We therefore conclude that Cd(2+) efflux is not the mechanism behind ABCB1-mediated protection from Cd(2+) apoptosis. Rather, the sphingolipid glucosylceramide may be the proapoptotic substrate extruded by ABCB1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wolfson, Rachel K</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HMGB1 induces human lung endothelial cell cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier disruption.</title><secondary-title>Microvascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microvascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>189-197</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Actin Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gap Junctions</keyword><keyword>Gap Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>HMGB1 Protein: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins</keyword><keyword>HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins: gen</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins: met</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: metabolism</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: antagonists</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21146549</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mvr.2010.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3678727&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Acute lung injury (ALI) results from loss of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity and the evolution of high-permeability pulmonary edema resulting in alveolar flooding and significant morbidity and mortality. HMGB1 is a late mediator of sepsis which uniquely participates in the evolution of sepsis and sepsis-induced ALI. The molecular events by which HMGB1 contributes to ALI remain poorly characterized. We characterized the role of HMGB1 in endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeletal rearrangement and vascular permeability, events essential to paracellular gap formation and barrier dysfunction characteristic of ALI. Initial experiments demonstrated HMGB1-mediated dose-dependent (5-20 μg/ml) decreases in transendothelial cell electrical resistance (TER) in the human pulmonary artery EC, a reflection of loss of barrier integrity. Furthermore, HMGB1 produced dose-dependent increases in paracellular gap formation in concert with loss of peripheral organized actin fibers, dissociation of cell-cell junctional cadherins, and the development of central stress fibers, a phenotypic change associated with increased contractile activity and increased EC permeability. Using siRNA strategies directed against known HMGB1 receptors (RAGE, TLR2, TLR4), we systematically determined that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is the primary receptor signaling HMGB1-induced TER decreases and paracellular gap formation via p38 MAP kinase activation and phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein, Hsp27. These studies add to the understanding of HMGB1-induced inflammatory events and vascular barrier disruption and offer the potential for clinical intervention in sepsis-induced ALI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burnside, Kellie</author><author>Lembo, Annalisa</author><author>Harrell, Maria Isabel</author><author>Gurney, Michael</author><author>Xue, Liang</author><author>BinhTran, Nguyen-Thao</author><author>Connelly, James E</author><author>Jewell, Kelsea a</author><author>Schmidt, Byron Z</author><author>de los Reyes, Melissa</author><author>Tao, Weiguo Andy</author><author>Doran, Kelly S</author><author>Rajagopal, Lakshmi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serine/threonine phosphatase Stp1 mediates post-transcriptional regulation of hemolysin, autolysis, and virulence of group B Streptococcus.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>44197-44210</pages><volume>286</volume><issue>51</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arylsulfotransferase</keyword><keyword>Arylsulfotransferase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Phosphoprotein Phosphatases</keyword><keyword>Phosphoprotein Phosphatases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Post-Transcriptional</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword><keyword>Proteomics: methods</keyword><keyword>RNA Processing</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Virulence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22081606</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M111.313486</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

Group B streptococci (GBS) are β-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria that cause invasive infections in humans. To adapt to environmental changes, GBS encodes signaling mechanisms comprising two component systems and eukaryotic-like enzymes. We have previously described the importance of the serine/threonine kinase Stk1 to GBS pathogenesis. However, how the presence or absence of the cognate serine/threonine phosphatase Stp1 affects Stk1 function and GBS virulence is not known. Here, we show that GBS deficient only in Stp1 expression are markedly reduced for their ability to cause systemic infections, exhibit decreased β-hemolysin/cytolysin activity, and show increased sensitivity to autolysis. Although transcription of genes important for β-hemolysin/cytolysin expression and export is similar to the wild type (WT), 294 genes (excluding stp1) showed altered expression in the stp1 mutant and included autolysin genes. Furthermore, phosphopeptide enrichment analysis identified that 35 serine/threonine phosphopeptides, corresponding to 27 proteins, were unique to the stp1 mutant. This included phosphorylation of ATP synthase, DNA and RNA helicases, and proteins important for cell division and protein synthesis. Collectively, our results indicate that Stp1 is important for appropriate regulation of Stk1 function, hemolysin activity, autolysis, and GBS virulence.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maingat, Ferdinand</author><author>Halloran, Brendan</author><author>Acharjee, Shaona</author><author>van Marle, Guido</author><author>Church, Deirdre</author><author>Gill, M John</author><author>Uwiera, Richard R E</author><author>Cohen, Eric a</author><author>Meddings, Jon</author><author>Madsen, Karen</author><author>Power, Christopher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inflammation and epithelial cell injury in AIDS enteropathy: involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</title><secondary-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2211-2220</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>cd4 ϩ t lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>disease</keyword><keyword>er stress</keyword><keyword>fiv</keyword><keyword>gut</keyword><keyword>hiv</keyword><keyword>lentivirus</keyword><keyword>lym-</keyword><keyword>occurs in the gut-associated</keyword><keyword>of this population of</keyword><keyword>phoid tissues</keyword><keyword>proximal to the mucosa</keyword><keyword>t cells may contribute</keyword><keyword>the loss</keyword><keyword>to mucosal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21427211</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.10-175992</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3114526&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Immunosuppressive lentivirus infections, including human, simian, and feline immunodeficiency viruses (HIV, SIV, and FIV, respectively), cause the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), frequently associated with AIDS enteropathy. Herein, we investigated the extent to which lentivirus infections affected mucosal integrity and intestinal permeability in conjunction with immune responses and activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Duodenal biopsies from individuals with HIV/AIDS exhibited induction of IL-1β, CD3ε, HLA-DRA, spliced XBP-1(Xbp-1s), and CHOP expression compared to uninfected persons (P&lt;0.05). Gut epithelial cells exposed to HIV-1 Vpr demonstrated elevated TNF-α, IL-1β, spliced Xbp-1s, and CHOP expression (P&lt;0.05) together with calcium activation and disruption of epithelial cell monolayer permeability. In addition to reduced blood CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels, viral loads in the gut and plasma were high in FIV-infected animals (P&lt;0.05). FIV-infected animals also exhibited a failure to gain weight and increased lactulose/mannitol ratios compared with uninfected animals (P&lt;0.05). Proinflammatory and ER stress gene expression were activated in the ileum of FIV-infected animals (P&lt;0.05), accompanied by intestinal epithelial damage with loss of epithelial cells and leukocyte infiltration of the lamina propria.

Furthermore, silencing of IQGAP1 abrogated the barrier enhancement effect of angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) and abolished the barrier-stabilizing effect of Angpt-1 on thrombin-stimulated cells. Coimmunoprecipitation detected binding of endogenous IQGAP1 with Rac1 at baseline that was stronger when Rac1 was activated and weaker when it was deactivated. Measurement of GTP-bound Rac1 revealed that Angpt-1 failed to activate Rac1 not only if IQGAP1 was silenced but also if cells were transfected with a mutant disabled in Rac1 binding (T1050AX2). Furthermore, a dominant-active Rac1 was sufficient to completely reverse the morphological and functional changes induced by reduction in IQGAP1. CONCLUSION: These experiments are the first demonstration of IQGAP1 regulating barrier function in any cell type. Further, our data show that Angpt-1 requires IQGAP1 as an indispensable activator of Rac1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stolwijk, Judith A</author><author>Hartmann, Christoph</author><author>Balani, Poonam</author><author>Albermann, Silke</author><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of adherent cells after in situ electroporation: non-invasive monitoring during intracellular manipulations.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>4720-4727</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Bleomycin</keyword><keyword>Bleomycin: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electroporation</keyword><keyword>Electroporation: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21684144</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2011.05.033</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Impedance analysis of adherent cells after in situ electroporation: non-invasive monitoring during intracellular manipulations. - Stolwijk, Judith A; Hartmann, Christoph; Balani, Poonam; Albermann, Silke; Keese, Charles R; Giaever, Ivar; Wegener, Joachim)

The impedance of the cell-covered electrode was measured at designated frequencies to monitor the behavior of the cells with time. This approach is referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing or short ECIS in the literature. The gold-film electrodes were also used to deliver well-defined AC voltage pulses of several volts amplitude and several hundred milliseconds duration to the adherent cells in order to achieve reversible membrane electroporation (in situ electroporation=ISE). Electroporation-assisted introduction of membrane impermeable molecules into the cytoplasm was studied by using FITC-labeled dextran molecules of different molecular weights. Probes as big as 2MDa were successfully loaded into the cells residing on the electrode surface. Time-resolved impedance measurements before and immediately after the electroporation pulse revealed the kinetics of membrane resealing as well as subsequent changes in cell morphology. Cells recovered from the electroporation pulse within less than 90 min. When membrane-impermeable, bioactive compounds like N(3)(-) or bleomycin were introduced into the cells by in situ electroporation, concomitant ECIS readings sensitively reported on the associated response of the cells to these toxins as a function of time (ISE-ECIS).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hatanaka, Kunihiko</author><author>Simons, Michael</author><author>Murakami, Masahiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin controls endothelial phenotypes via p120-catenin coupling and Rac1 activation.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

To this end, we introduced either wild-type VE-cadherin or Y658 phosphomimetic (Y658E) or dephosphomimetic (Y658F) VE-cadherin mutant constructs into an endothelial cell line (rat fat pad endothelial cells) lacking endogenous VE-cadherin. Remarkably, neither wild-type- nor Y658E VE-cadherin was retained at cell-cell contacts because of p120-catenin preferential binding to N-cadherin, resulting in the targeting of N-cadherin to cell-cell junctions and the exclusion of VE-cadherin. However, Y658F VE-cadherin was able to bind p120-catenin and to localize at adherence junctions displacing N-cadherin. This resulted in an enhanced barrier function and a complete abrogation of Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation, thereby inhibiting cell migration. These findings demonstrate that VE-cadherin, through the regulation of Y658 phosphorylation, competes for junctional localization with N-cadherin and controls vascular permeability and endothelial cell migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halterman, Julia A</author><author>Kwon, H Moo</author><author>Zargham, Ramin</author><author>Bortz, Pamela D Schoppee</author><author>Wamhoff, Brian R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation.</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2287-2296</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Angiotensin II</keyword><keyword>Angiotensin II: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E: genetics</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: genetics</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>Carotid Artery Injuries</keyword><keyword>Carotid Artery Injuries: genetics</keyword><keyword>Carotid Artery Injuries: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Carotid Artery Injuries: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hyperplasia</keyword><keyword>Introns</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Muscle</keyword><keyword>Myocytes</keyword><keyword>NFATC Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>NFATC Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>NFATC Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Reporter</keyword><keyword>Smooth</keyword><keyword>Smooth Muscle</keyword><keyword>Smooth Muscle: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Smooth Muscle: pathology</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Tunica Intima</keyword><keyword>Tunica Intima: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tunica Intima: pathology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21757659</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.232165</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3188807&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The tonicity-responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5/tonicity enhancer binding protein [TonEBP]), has been well characterized in numerous cell types; however, NFAT5 function in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is unknown.

The molecular effects of obesity on carcinogenesis are mediated by the autocrine and paracrine effects of the adipocytokine leptin. Leptin participates in the tumor progression and metastasis of human breast. We show that leptin induces clonogenicity and increases the migration potential of breast cancer cells. We found that survivin expression is induced in response to leptin. In this study, we examine the role and leptin-mediated regulation of survivin. Leptin treatment leads to survivin upregulation, due in part to the activation of Notch1 and the release of a transcriptionally active Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that NICD gets recruited to the survivin promoter at the CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jk, Su(H), Lag-1) binding site in response to leptin treatment. Inhibition of Notch1 activity inhibits leptin-induced survivin upregulation. Leptin-induced transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in leptin-mediated Notch1 and survivin upregulation, demonstrating a novel upstream role of leptin-EGFR-Notch1 axis. We further show that leptin-induced migration of breast cancer cells requires survivin, as overexpression of survivin further increases, whereas silencing survivin abrogates leptin-induced migration. Using a pharmacological approach to inhibit survivin, we show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin, can effectively inhibit leptin-induced survivin expression and migration. Importantly, leptin increased breast tumor growth in nude mice. These data show a novel role for survivin in leptin-induced migration and put forth pharmacological survivin inhibition as a potential novel therapeutic strategy. This conclusion is supported by in vivo data showing the overexpression of leptin and survivin in epithelial cells of high-grade ductal carcinomas in situ and in high-grade invasive carcinomas.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Fan</author><author>Liu, Shuo</author><author>Wang, Shur-jen</author><author>Yu, Chuanhui</author><author>Fisher, Mark J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cellular Physiology Biochemistry and Biochemistr y Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Barrier Properties of Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells</title><secondary-title>Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>631-638</pages><volume>92868</volume><keywords><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>fibrinolysis</keyword><keyword>microvasculature</keyword><keyword>stroke</keyword><keyword>tissue plasminogen activator</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><urls/><label>ECIS TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doherty, Gary J</author><author>Åhlund, Monika K</author><author>Howes, Mark T</author><author>Morén, Björn</author><author>Parton, Robert G</author><author>McMahon, Harvey T</author><author>Lundmark, Richard</author><author>Ahlund, Monika K</author><author>Howes, Mark T</author><author>Morén, Björn</author><author>Parton, Robert G</author><author>McMahon, Harvey T</author><author>Lundmark, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The endocytic protein GRAF1 is directed to cell-matrix adhesion sites and regulates cell spreading.</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology of the cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology of the cell</full-title></periodical><pages>4380-4389</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Clathrin</keyword><keyword>Clathrin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>GTPase-Activating Proteins</keyword><keyword>GTPase-Activating Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipids</keyword><keyword>Membrane Microdomains</keyword><keyword>Membrane Microdomains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Tertiary</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21965292</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E10-12-0936</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (The endocytic protein GRAF1 is directed to cell-matrix adhesion sites and regulates cell spreading. - Doherty, Gary J; Åhlund, Monika K; Howes, Mark T; Morén, Björn; Parton, Robert G; McMahon, Harvey T; Lundmark, Richard)

However, the cell biological functions of this highly prevalent endocytic pathway are unclear. In this article, we present biochemical and cell biological evidence that GRAF1 interacted with a network of endocytic and adhesion proteins and was found enriched at podosome-like adhesions and src-induced podosomes. We further demonstrate that these sites comprise microdomains of highly ordered lipid enriched in GRAF1 endocytic cargo. GRAF1 activity was upregulated in spreading cells and uptake via CLICs was concentrated at the leading edge of migrating cells. Depletion of GRAF1, which inhibits CLIC generation, resulted in profound defects in cell spreading and migration. We propose that GRAF1 remodels membrane microdomains at adhesion sites into endocytic carriers, facilitating membrane turnover during cell morphological changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarrab, Ramadan M</author><author>Lennon, Rachel</author><author>Ni, Lan</author><author>Wherlock, Matthew D</author><author>Welsh, Gavin I</author><author>Saleem, Moin A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Establishment of conditionally immortalized human glomerular mesangial cells in culture, with unique migratory properties.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Mesangial cells were isolated from glomerular outgrowths from a normal human kidney, then retrovirally transfected with a temperature-sensitive SV40T antigen+human telomerase (hTERT). Mesangial cells exhibited features of compact cells with small bodies in a confluent monolayer at 33°C, but the cell shape changed to flat and stellate after 5 days in growth-restrictive conditions (37°C). Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that podocyte markers (nephrin, CD2AP, podocin, Wilms' tumor-1) and an endothelial-specific molecule (VE-cadherin) were not detectable in this cell line, whereas markers characteristic of mesangial cells (α-SMA, fibronectin, and PDGFβ-R) were strongly expressed. In migration assays, a significant reduction in wound surface was observed in podocyte and endothelial cells as soon as 12 h (75 and 62%, respectively) and complete wound closure after 24 h. In contrast, no significant change was observed in mesangial cells after 12 h, and even after 48 h the wounds were not completely closed. Until now, conditionally immortalized podocyte and endothelial cell lines derived from mice and humans have been described, and this has greatly boosted research on glomerular physiology and pathology. We have established the first conditionally immortalized human glomerular mesangial cell line, which will be an important adjunct in studies of representative glomerular cells, as well as in coculture studies. Unexpectedly, mesangial cells' ability to migrate seems to be slower than for other glomerular cells, suggesting this line will demonstrate functional properties distinct from previously available mesangial cell cultures. This conditionally immortalized human mesangial cell line represents a new tool for the study of human mesangial cell biology in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schäfer, Edith</author><author>Westendorf, Christian</author><author>Bodenschatz, Eberhard</author><author>Beta, Carsten</author><author>Geil, Burkhard</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shape oscillations of Dictyostelium discoideum cells on ultramicroelectrodes monitored by impedance analysis.</title><secondary-title>Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</full-title></periodical><pages>723-726</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium: cytology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Microelectrodes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21425455</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201001955</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425455</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Time-resolved analysis employing electric cell–substrate impedance sensing reveals periodic impedance changes of small ensembles of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae oscillating synchronously upon deprivation of food.

One characteristic of malignant cancerous cells is their ability to invade tissue. Cell adhesion and cytoskeletal activity have served as valuable indicators for understanding the cancer cell behaviours, such as proliferation, migration and invasion. This review focuses on bio-impedance based measurement for monitoring the behaviours in real time and without using labels. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) provides rich information about cell-substrate interactions, cell-cell communication and cell adhesion. High sensitivity of the ECIS method allows for observing events down to single-cell level and achieving nanoscale resolution of cell-substrate distances. Recently, its miniaturization and integration with fluorescent detection techniques have been highlighted as a new tool to deliver a high-content platform for anticancer drug development.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rangasamy, Sampathkumar</author><author>Srinivasan, Ramprasad</author><author>Maestas, Joann</author><author>McGuire, Paul G</author><author>Das, Arup</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A potential role for angiopoietin 2 in the regulation of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetic retinopathy.</title><secondary-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</full-title></periodical><pages>3784-3791</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Angiopoietin-1</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-2</keyword><keyword>Angiopoietin-2: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Blood-Retinal Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Retinal Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy</keyword><keyword>Diabetic Retinopathy: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Experimental</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Glucose</keyword><keyword>Glucose: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hyperglycemia</keyword><keyword>Hyperglycemia: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Indirect</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Tyrosine</keyword><keyword>Tyrosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21310918</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.10-6386</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (A potential role for angiopoietin 2 in the regulation of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetic retinopathy. - Rangasamy, Sampathkumar; Srinivasan, Ramprasad; Maestas, Joann; McGuire, Paul G; Das, Arup)

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as second messengers during endothelial migration. Multiple intracellular sources of ROS are regulated by cellular context, external stimulus, and the microenvironment. However, the predominant source of ROS during endothelial cell (EC) migration and the mechanisms by which ROS regulate cell migration are incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondria-derived ROS (mtROS) regulate EC migration. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, VEGF increased mitochondrial metabolism, promoted mtROS production, and induced cell migration. Either the targeted mitochondrial delivery of the antioxidant, vitamin E (Mito-Vit-E), or the depletion of mitochondrial DNA abrogated VEGF-mediated mtROS production. Overexpression of mitochondrial catalase also inhibited VEGF-induced mitochondrial metabolism, Rac activation, and cell migration. Furthermore, these interventions suppressed VEGF-stimulated EC migration and blocked Rac1 activation in endothelial cells. Constitutively active Rac1 reversed Mito-Vit-E-induced inhibition of EC migration. Mito-Vit-E also attenuated carotid artery reendothelialization in vivo. These results provide strong evidence that mtROS regulate EC migration through Rac-1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amatschek, S</author><author>Lucas, R</author><author>Eger, A</author><author>Pflueger, M</author><author>Hundsberger, H</author><author>Knoll, C</author><author>Grosse-Kracht, S</author><author>Schuett, W</author><author>Koszik, F</author><author>Maurer, D</author><author>Wiesner, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CXCL9 induces chemotaxis, chemorepulsion and endothelial barrier disruption through CXCR3-mediated activation of melanoma cells.</title><secondary-title>British journal of cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British journal of cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>469-479</pages><volume>104</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CXCR3</keyword><keyword>CXCR3: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CXCL9</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CXCL9: secretion</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Melanoma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration</keyword><keyword>Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration: im</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21179030</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/sj.bjc.6606056</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3049560&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Metastasis is associated with poor prognosis for melanoma. The formation of metastases is a multi-step process, in which cancer cells can subsequently acquire the potential to intravasate into the blood or lymph vessels, disseminate through the circulation, extravasate through the endothelium and invade the connective tissue. There is increasing evidence that chemokines have a pivotal role in the dissemination and establishment of melanoma metastasis. METHODS: We isolated melanoma cells from melanoma metastasis and performed different migration assays and transendothelial resistance measurements of endothelial monolayers co-cultured with melanoma cells, in order to monitor barrier function and diapedesis and confirmed these results by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: We observed that tumour endothelial cells (ECs) secrete high levels of CXCL9 in all, and CXCL10 in most melanoma metastases. Migration studies revealed that low concentrations of these chemokines induce chemotaxis, whereas high concentrations induce spontaneous migration of melanoma cells (chemokinesis/chemorepulsion) and the disruption of the endothelial barrier, resulting in an accelerated transendothelial migration (TEM). Addition of anti-CXCL9 or anti-CXCR3 antibodies to the co-cultures delayed the TEM of melanoma cells. CONCLUSION: Our data represent novel mechanisms by which tumour cells in melanoma metastases might use the chemokine-expressing endothelium to leave the tumour and eventually to form additional metastases at distinct sites.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Hyo Eun</author><author>Kim, Donghee</author><author>Koh, Hyun Sook</author><author>Cho, Sungbo</author><author>Sung, Jung-Suk</author><author>Kim, Jae Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time monitoring of neural differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</title><secondary-title>Journal of biomedicine &amp; biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of biomedicine &amp; biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>485173</pages><volume>2011</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21716652</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2011/485173</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Real-time monitoring of neural differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. - Park, Hyo Eun; Kim, Donghee; Koh, Hyun Sook; Cho, Sungbo; Sung, Jung-Suk; Kim, Jae Young)

Stem cell differentiation must be monitored thoroughly and precisely prior to transplantation. In this study we evaluated the usefulness of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) for in vitro real-time monitoring of neural differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We cultured hMSCs in neural differentiation media (NDM) for 6 days and examined the time-course of impedance changes with an ECIS array. We also monitored the expression of markers for neural differentiation, total cell count, and cell cycle profiles. Cellular expression of neuron and oligodendrocyte markers increased. The resistance value of cells cultured in NDM was automatically measured in real-time and found to increase much more slowly over time compared to cells cultured in non-differentiation media. The relatively slow resistance changes observed in differentiating MSCs were determined to be due to their lower growth capacity achieved by induction of cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. Overall results suggest that the relatively slow change in resistance values measured by ECIS method can be used as a parameter for slowly growing neural-differentiating cells. However, to enhance the competence of ECIS for in vitro real-time monitoring of neural differentiation of MSCs, more elaborate studies are needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ablin, Richard J</author><author>Kynaston, Howard G</author><author>Mason, Malcolm D</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4) antagonizes the anti-tumour action of MDA-7/IL-24 in prostate cancer.</title><secondary-title>Journal of translational medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of translational medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>49</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interleukins</keyword><keyword>Interleukins: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Interleukins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central Ltd</publisher><accession-num>21524313</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1479-5876-9-49</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4) antagonizes the anti-tumour action of MDA-7/IL-24 in prostate cancer. - Ablin, Richard J; Kynaston, Howard G; Mason, Malcolm D; Jiang, Wen G)

We have previously reported an association between the GTPase R-Ras and repeat 3 of Filamin A (FLNa). Loss of FLNa has been linked to increased vascular permeability. We sought to determine whether FLNa's association with R-Ras affects endothelial barrier function. We report that in endothelial cells endogenous R-Ras interacts with endogenous FLNa as determined by co-immunoprecipitations and pulldowns with the FLNa-GST fusion protein repeats 1-10. Deletion of FLNa repeat 3 (FLNaΔ3) abrogated this interaction. In these cells FLNa and R-Ras co-localize at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of R-Ras and/or FLNa by siRNA promotes vascular permeability, as determined by TransEndothelial Electrical Resistance and FITC-dextran transwell assays. Re-expression of FLNa restored endothelial barrier function in cells lacking FLNa whereas re-expression of FLNaΔ3 did not. Immunostaining for VE-Cadherin in cells with knocked down R-Ras and FLNa demonstrated a disorganization of VE-Cadherin at adherens junctions. Loss of R-Ras and FLNa or blocking R-Ras function via GGTI-2133, a selective R-Ras inhibitor, induced vascular permeability and increased phosphorylation of VE-Cadherin (Y731) and Src (Y416). Expression of dominant negative R-Ras promoted vascular permeability that was blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2. These findings demonstrate that maintaining endothelial barrier function is dependent upon active R-Ras and association between R-Ras and FLNa and that loss of this interaction promotes VE-Cadherin phosphorylation and changes in downstream effectors that lead to endothelial leakiness.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>David, Sascha</author><author>Ghosh, Chandra C</author><author>Kümpers, Philipp</author><author>Shushakova, Nelli</author><author>Van Slyke, Paul</author><author>Khankin, Eliyahu V</author><author>Karumanchi, S Ananth</author><author>Dumont, Dan</author><author>Parikh, Samir M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of a synthetic PEG-ylated Tie-2 agonist peptide on endotoxemic lung injury and mortality.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

A polyethylene-oxide clustered version of this peptide, termed vasculotide (VT), was reported to activate Tie-2 and promote angiogenesis in a mouse model of diabetic ulcer. We hypothesized that VT administration would defend endothelial barrier function against sepsis-associated mediators of permeability, prevent lung vascular leakage arising in endotoxemia, and improve mortality in endotoxemic mice. In confluent human microvascular endothelial cells, VT prevented endotoxin-induced (lipopolysaccharides, LPS O111:B4) gap formation, loss of monolayer resistance, and translocation of labeled albumin. In 8-wk-old male C57Bl6/J mice given a ∼70% lethal dose of endotoxin (15 mg/kg ip), VT prevented lung vascular leakage and reversed the attenuation of lung vascular endothelial cadherin induced by endotoxemia. These protective effects of VT were associated with activation of Tie-2 and its downstream mediator, Akt. Echocardiographic studies showed only a nonsignificant trend toward improved myocardial performance associated with VT. Finally, we evaluated survival in this mouse model. Pretreatment with VT improved survival by 41.4% (n = 15/group, P = 0.02) and post-LPS administration of VT improved survival by 33.3% (n = 15/group, P = 0.051). VT-mediated protection from LPS lethality was lost in Tie-2 heterozygous mice, in agreement with VT's proposed receptor specificity. We conclude that this synthetic Tie-2 agonist, completely unrelated to endogenous Tie-2 ligands, is sufficient to activate the receptor and its downstream pathways in vivo and that the Tie-2 receptor may be an important target for therapeutic evaluation in conditions of pathological vascular leakage.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inoshima, Ichiro</author><author>Inoshima, Naoko</author><author>Wilke, Georgia a</author><author>Powers, Michael E</author><author>Frank, Karen M</author><author>Wang, Yang</author><author>Bubeck Wardenburg, Juliane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Staphylococcus aureus pore-forming toxin subverts the activity of ADAM10 to cause lethal infection in mice.</title><secondary-title>Nature medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1310-1314</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases</keyword><keyword>Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: poisoning</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: physiology</keyword><keyword>Bronchoalveolar Lavage</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Epithelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hemolysin Proteins: poisoning</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia: genetics</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus aureus</keyword><keyword>Staphylococcus aureus: chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21926978</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nm.2451</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3192248&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of human disease, responsible for half a million infections and approximately 20,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. This pathogen secretes α-hemolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin that contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia. α-hemolysin injures epithelial cells in vitro by interacting with its receptor, the zinc-dependent metalloprotease ADAM10 (ref. 6). We show here that mice harboring a conditional disruption of the Adam10 gene in lung epithelium are resistant to lethal pneumonia. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of toxin-receptor function revealed that α-hemolysin upregulates ADAM10 metalloprotease activity in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in cleavage of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Cleavage is associated with disruption of epithelial barrier function, contributing to the pathogenesis of lethal acute lung injury. A metalloprotease inhibitor of ADAM10 prevents E-cadherin cleavage in response to Hla; similarly, toxin-dependent E-cadherin proteolysis and barrier disruption is attenuated in ADAM10-knockout mice. Together, these data attest to the function of ADAM10 as the cellular receptor for α-hemolysin. The observation that α-hemolysin can usurp the metalloprotease activity of its receptor reveals a previously unknown mechanism of pore-forming cytotoxin action in which pathologic insults are not solely the result of irreversible membrane injury and defines ADAM10 inhibition as a strategy to attenuate α-hemolysin-induced disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Tracey A</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Claudin-16/paracellin-1, cloning, expression, and its role in tight junction functions in cancer and endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</full-title></periodical><pages>383-407</pages><volume>762</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Claudins</keyword><keyword>Cloning</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers: genetics</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique: methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry: methods</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Molecular</keyword><keyword>Molecular: methods</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel: methods</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction: m</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>Western: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21717372</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-1-61779-185-7_28</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.springerlink.com/index/R342J880876WMM85.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21717372</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>Metastatic spread of cancer is the major reason for patient mortality in human breast cancer. We examined expression of claudin-16 in human breast cells and tissues to identify a possible link between expression and aggressiveness in cells and between claudin-16 levels and patient prognosis. Forced expression of claudin-16 in breast cancer cells resulted in a less aggressive phenotype and reduced in vivo tumour volume. Claudin-16 expression was reduced in human breast cancer, particularly in patients with aggressive tumours and high mortality (Martin et al. J Cell Biochem 105:41-52,2008). This suggests that claudin-16 plays a role beyond that of an initial metastasis repressor in this cancer type.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stokman, Geurt</author><author>Qin, Yu</author><author>Genieser, Hans-Gottfried</author><author>Schwede, Frank</author><author>de Heer, Emile</author><author>Bos, Johannes L</author><author>Bajema, Ingeborg M</author><author>van de Water, Bob</author><author>Price, Leo S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epac-Rap signaling reduces cellular stress and ischemia-induced kidney failure.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</full-title></periodical><pages>859-872</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Hypoxia</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: physiology</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Ischemia</keyword><keyword>Ischemia: complications</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>Kidney: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Physiological</keyword><keyword>Proximal</keyword><keyword>Proximal: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Renal Insufficiency</keyword><keyword>Renal Insufficiency: etiology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Stress</keyword><keyword>rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21493776</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1681/ASN.2010040423</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3083308&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with the loss of tubular epithelial cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions which contribute to renal failure. The Epac-Rap signaling pathway is a potent regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. The cyclic AMP analogue 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP has been shown to selectively activate Epac, whereas the addition of an acetoxymethyl (AM) ester to 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP enhanced in vitro cellular uptake. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of Epac-Rap signaling using acetoxymethyl-8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP preserves cell adhesions during hypoxia in vitro, maintaining the barrier function of the epithelial monolayer. Intrarenal administration in vivo of 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP also reduced renal failure in a mouse model for ischemia-reperfusion injury. This was accompanied by decreased expression of the tubular cell stress marker clusterin-α, and lateral expression of β-catenin after ischemia indicative of sustained tubular barrier function. Our study emphasizes the undervalued importance of maintaining tubular epithelial cell adhesion in renal ischemia and demonstrates the potential of pharmacological modulation of cell adhesion as a new therapeutic strategy to reduce the extent of injury in kidney disease and transplantation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Muñoz, Nilda M</author><author>Desai, Anjali</author><author>Osan, Christopher M</author><author>Meliton, Angelo Y</author><author>Leff, Alan R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Group V phospholipase A2 mediates barrier disruption of human pulmonary endothelial cells caused by LPS in vitro.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>361-368</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dextrans</keyword><keyword>Dextrans: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence: methods</keyword><keyword>Group V Phospholipases A2</keyword><keyword>Group V Phospholipases A2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Monoclonal: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20448053</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2009-0446OC</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Group V phospholipase A2 mediates barrier disruption of human pulmonary endothelial cells caused by LPS in vitro. - Dudek, Steven M; Muñoz, Nilda M; Desai, Anjali; Osan, Christopher M; Meliton, Angelo Y; Leff, Alan R)

Expression of gVPLA(2) was elicited by 20 ng/ml LPS as demonstrated by increased (1) mRNA, (2) protein content, and (3) cell surface expression of gVPLA(2) within 4 hours. The effect of LPS on EC barrier function was measured by transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance (TER). LPS increased permeability across EC monolayers at 2-3 hours, and was sustained for 10 hours or more. Blockade of gVPLA(2) with mouse monoclonal 3G1 (MCL-3G1) monoclonal antibody directed against gVPLA(2) inhibited EC barrier dysfunction elicited by LPS in a time- and concentration-dependent manner; control IgG had no effect on TER. Like LPS, exogenous gVPLA(2) caused increased EC permeability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner; neither gIIaPLA(2), a close homolog of gVPLA(2), nor W31A, an inactive mutant of gVPLA(2), caused a decrease in EC TER. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed comparable F-actin stress fiber and intercellular gap formation for ECs treated with either gVPLA(2) or LPS. Treatment with gVPLA(2) disrupted vascular endothelial-cadherin junctional complexes on ECs. Coincubation of ECs with MCL-3G1 substantially attenuated the structural changes caused by gVPLA(2) or LPS. We demonstrate that (1) gVPLA(2) is constitutively expressed in ECs and is up-regulated after LPS activation, (2) endogenously secreted gVPLA(2) from ECs after LPS increases EC permeability through F-actin and junctional complex rearrangement, and (3) inhibition of endogenous gVPLA(2) from ECs is sufficient to block disruption of the EC barrier function after LPS in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bogatcheva, Natalia V</author><author>Zemskova, Marina A</author><author>Gorshkov, Boris A</author><author>Kim, Kyung Mi</author><author>Daglis, Gregory A</author><author>Poirier, Christophe</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ezrin, radixin, and moesin are phosphorylated in response to 2-methoxyestradiol and modulate endothelial hyperpermeability.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1185-1194</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Estradiol</keyword><keyword>Estradiol: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Estradiol: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Indoles</keyword><keyword>Indoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Maleimides</keyword><keyword>Maleimides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Paclitaxel</keyword><keyword>Paclitaxel: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pyrroles</keyword><keyword>Pyrroles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tubulin Modulators</keyword><keyword>Tubulin Modulators: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21659656</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2011-0092OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21659656</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3262663&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>We showed previously that microtubule disruptor 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) induces hyperpermeability of the endothelial monolayer via mechanisms that include the activation of p38 and Rho kinase (ROCK) and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Using the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors Ro-31-7549 and Ro-32-0432, we show in vitro and in vivo that 2ME-induced barrier dysfunction is also PKC-dependent. The known PKC substrates ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) were recently implicated in the regulation of endothelial permeability. This study tested the hypotheses that ERM proteins are phosphorylated in response to 2ME, and that this phosphorylation is involved in 2ME-induced barrier dysfunction. We show that the application of 2ME leads to a dramatic increase in the level of ERM phosphorylation. This increase is attenuated in cells pretreated with the microtubule stabilizer taxol. In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), the phosphorylation of ERM occurs in a p38-dependent and PKC-dependent manner. The activation of p38 appears to occur upstream from the activation of PKC, in response to 2ME. Phosphorylated ERM are localized at the cell periphery during the early phase of response to 2ME (15 minutes), and colocalize with F-actin branching points during the later phase of response (60 minutes). Using the short interfering RNA approach, we also showed that individual ERM depletion significantly attenuates 2ME-induced hyperpermeability. HPAEC monolayers, depleted of ERM proteins and monolayers, overexpressing phosphorylation-deficient ERM mutants, exhibit less attenuation of 2ME-induced barrier disruption in response to the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-7549. These results suggest a critical role of PKC activation in response to microtubule-disrupting agents, and implicate the phosphorylation of ERM in the barrier dysfunction induced by 2ME.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sidhaye, Venkataramana K</author><author>Chau, Eric</author><author>Breysse, Patrick N</author><author>King, Landon S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Septin-2 mediates airway epithelial barrier function in physiologic and pathologic conditions.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>120-126</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: pathology</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: pathology</keyword><keyword>Septins</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20870893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2010-0235OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3145065&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Epithelial cells have the ability to regulate paracellular permeability dynamically in response to extracellular stimuli. With every respiratory effort, airway epithelial cells are exposed to both physiologic as well as pathologic stimuli, and regulation of the epithelial barrier in response to these stimuli is crucial to respiratory function. We report that increased membrane septin-2 localization mediates decreases in paracellular permeability by altering cortical actin arrangement in human airway epithelial cells. This phenomenon occurs in response to both physiologic levels of shear stress and a pathologic stimulus, particular matter exposure. The resulting changes in barrier function in response to septin-2 redistribution have a significant impact on the ability of the apical ligand, epidermal growth factor, to interact with its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, which is segregated to the basolateral side in airway epithelial cells. This suggests that the dynamic regulation of the epithelial barrier function is essential in regulating signaling responses to extracellular stimuli. These findings indicate that septin-2 plays a fundamental role in regulating barrier function by altering cortical actin expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Kreuk, Bart-Jan</author><author>Nethe, Micha</author><author>Fernandez-Borja, Mar</author><author>Anthony, Eloise C</author><author>Hensbergen, Paul J</author><author>Deelder, Andre M</author><author>Plomann, Markus</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2 associates with Rac1 and regulates cell spreading and migration.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>2375-2388</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>Pt 14</issue><keywords><keyword>f-bar</keyword><keyword>gtpase</keyword><keyword>pacsin2</keyword><keyword>rac1</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21693584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.080630</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (The F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2 associates with Rac1 and regulates cell spreading and migration. - de Kreuk, Bart-Jan; Nethe, Micha; Fernandez-Borja, Mar; Anthony, Eloise C; Hensbergen, Paul J; Deelder, Andre M; Plomann, Markus; Hordijk, Peter L)

We previously identified a series of regulatory proteins that associate with Rac1 through its hypervariable C-terminal domain, including the Rac1 activator β-Pix (also known as Rho guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor 7) and the membrane adapter caveolin-1. Here, we show that Rac1 associates, through its C-terminus, with the F-BAR domain protein PACSIN2, an inducer of membrane tubulation and a regulator of endocytosis. We show that Rac1 localizes with PACSIN2 at intracellular tubular structures and on early endosomes. Active Rac1 induces a loss of PACSIN2-positive tubular structures. By contrast, Rac1 inhibition results in an accumulation of PACSIN2-positive tubules. In addition, PACSIN2 appears to regulate Rac1 signaling; siRNA-mediated loss of PACSIN2 increases the levels of Rac1-GTP and promotes cell spreading and migration in a wound healing assay. Moreover, ectopic expression of PACSIN2 reduces Rac1-GTP levels in a fashion that is dependent on the PACSIN2-Rac1 interaction, on the membrane-tubulating capacity of PACSIN2 and on dynamin. These data identify the BAR-domain protein PACSIN2 as a Rac1 interactor that regulates Rac1-mediated cell spreading and migration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Starosta, Vitaliy</author><author>Wu, Tinghuai</author><author>Zimman, Alejandro</author><author>Pham, Donald</author><author>Tian, Xinyong</author><author>Oskolkova, Olga</author><author>Bochkov, Valery</author><author>Berliner, Judith A</author><author>Birukova, Anna A</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Regulation of Endothelial Cell Permeability by High and low Doses of OxPAPC.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21997484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2011-0153OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997484</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Generation of phospholipid oxidation products in atherosclerosis, sepsis and lung pathologies affects endothelial barrier function which has significant consequences on disease outcome in general. Our group has shown that OxPAPC at low concentrations increases endothelial cell (EC) barrier function but decreases it at higher concentrations. In this study we determined the mechanisms responsible for the pulmonary endothelial cell barrier dysfunction induced by high OxPAPC concentrations. OxPAPC in the 5-20 µg/ml range enhanced EC barrier monitored by increased ransendothelial electrical resistance. In contrast, higher OxPAPC concentrations (50-100 µg/ml) rapidly increased EC permeability, which was accompanied by increased total cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation at Tyr-418 and activation of Src kinase, and phosphorylation of adherens junction (AJ) protein VE-cadherin at Tyr-731 and Tyr-658, which was not observed in EC stimulated with low OxPAPC doses. Early tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was linked to dissociation of VE-cadherin - p120-catenin/β-catenin complexes and VE-cadherin internalization, while low OxPAPC doses promoted VE-cadherin - p120-catenin/β-catenin complex formation. High, but not low OxPAPC doses increased ROS production and protein oxidation. Inhibition of Src by PP2 and ROS production by NAC inhibited disassembly of VE-cadherin - p120-catenin complexes and attenuated high OxPAPC-induced EC barrier disruption. These results show differential effects of OxPAPC doses on VE-cadherin - p120-catenin complex assembly and EC barrier function. These data suggest that rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and other potential targets mediated by Src and ROS-dependent mechanisms plays a key role in dissociation of AJ complexes and EC barrier dysfunction induced by high OxPAPC doses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Young, Erik F</author><author>Smilenov, Lubomir B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance-Based Surveillance of Transient Permeability Changes in Coronary Endothelial Monolayers after Exposure to Ionizing Radiation</title><secondary-title>Radiation Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiation Research</full-title></periodical><pages>415-424</pages><volume>424</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1667/RR2665.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Impedance-Based Surveillance of Transient Permeability Changes in Coronary Endothelial Monolayers after Exposure to Ionizing Radiation - Young, Erik F; Smilenov, Lubomir B)

However, standardized quality control assays monitoring differentiation that are non-invasive and continuous over time are lacking. METHODS: We employed a non-invasive assay, using two different systems, to discriminate osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSC by monitoring impedance. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes served as non-specific controls. Impedance profiles were recorded comparing MSC from bone marrow and adipose tissue, either non-induced or induced for osteogenesis or adipogenesis, for 5-14 days, and correlated with differentiation markers assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Additionally, differentiation modulating effects of extracellular matrix components were analyzed. RESULTS: Adhesion and growth-related impedance profiles of non-induced MSC roughly resembled those of fibroblasts, whereas keratinocytes differed significantly. Distinct from that, osteogenic induction of MSC revealed initially rapid and continuously rising impedance, corresponding to mineralized calcium matrix formation. Conversely, adipogenic induction caused shallower initial slopes and eventually declining profiles, corresponding to more compact, adipocyte-like cells with numerous lipid vacuoles. Pre-coating with either collagen type I or IV apparently favored osteogenesis and fibronectin adipogenesis. Impedance recordings correlated well with the extent of differentiation evaluated by histochemical staining and protein and gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate that impedance profiling offers a basis for standardized real-time, non-invasive high-throughput screening of MSC properties. It enables further testing of the influence of diffusible factors or extracellular matrix composites on MSC differentiation or maintenance of stemness, thus substantiating therapeutic application.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneider, David</author><author>Tarantola, Marco</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamics of TGF-β induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition monitored by Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing.</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</full-title></periodical><pages>2099-2107</pages><volume>1813</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Detrended fluctuation analysis</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>Variance</keyword><keyword>electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>21839117</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.07.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839117</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Differentiation;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a program of cellular development associated with loss of cell-cell contacts, a decreased cell adhesion and substantial morphological changes. Besides its importance for numerous developmental processes, EMT has also been held responsible for the development and progression of tumors and formation of metastases. The influence of the cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) induced EMT on structure, migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and long-term correlations of the mammalian epithelial cell lines NMuMG, A549 and MDA-MB231 was investigated with time-resolved impedance analysis. The three cell lines show important differences in concentration dependency, cellular morphology and dynamics upon their response to TGF-β1. A549 cells and the non-tumor mouse epithelial cell line NMuMG show a substantial change in morphology mirrored in stepwise changes of their phenotype upon cytokine treatment. Impedance based measurements of micromotility reveal a complex dynamic response to TGF-β1 exposure which leads to a transient increase in fluctuation amplitude and long-term correlation. These changes in fluctuation amplitude are also detectable for MDA-MB231 cells, whereas the long-term correlation remains unvaried. We were able to distinguish three time domains during EMT. Initially, all cell lines display an increase in micromotion lasting 4 to 9h termed transitional state I. This regime is followed by transitional state II lasting approximately 20h, where cellular dynamics are diminished and, in case of the NMuMG cell line, a loss of cell-cell contacts occurs. Finally, the transformation into the mesenchymal-like phenotype occurs 24-30h after exposure to TGF-β1.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Müller, Jakob</author><author>Thirion, Christian</author><author>Pfaffl, Michael W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) based real-time measurement of titer dependent cytotoxicity induced by adenoviral vectors in an IPI-2I cell culture model.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>2000-2005</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoviridae</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae: genetics</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Conductometry</keyword><keyword>Conductometry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: virology</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20875729</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2010.08.075</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875729</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS Cytotoxicity;Virology</label><abstract>Recombinant viral vectors are widespread tools for transfer of genetic material in various modern biotechnological applications like for example RNA interference (RNAi). However, an accurate and reproducible titer assignment represents the basic step for most downstream applications regarding a precise multiplicity of infection (MOI) adjustment. As necessary scaffold for the studies described in this work we introduce a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) based approach for viral particle measurement. Still an implicated problem concerning physiological effects is that the appliance of viral vectors is often attended by toxic effects on the individual target. To determine the critical viral dose leading to cell death we developed an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) based assay. With ECIS technology the impedance change of a current flow through the cell culture medium in an array plate is measured in a non-invasive manner, visualizing effects like cell attachment, cell-cell contacts or proliferation. Here we describe the potential of this online measurement technique in an in vitro model using the porcine ileal epithelial cell line IPI-2I in combination with an adenoviral transfection vector (Ad5-derivate). This approach shows a clear dose-depending toxic effect, as the amount of applied virus highly correlates (p&lt;0.001) with the level of cell death. Thus this assay offers the possibility to discriminate the minimal non-toxic dose of the individual transfection method. In addition this work suggests that the ECIS-device bears the feasibility to transfer this assay to multiple other cytotoxicological questions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Privratsky, Jamie R</author><author>Paddock, Cathy M</author><author>Florey, Oliver</author><author>Newman, Debra K</author><author>Muller, William A</author><author>Newman, Peter J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relative contribution of PECAM-1 adhesion and signaling to the maintenance of vascular integrity.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>1477-1485</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>Pt 9</issue><keywords><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD31</keyword><keyword>CD31: genetics</keyword><keyword>CD31: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: genetics</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: genetics</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21486942</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.082271</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3078814&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>PECAM-1 (CD31) is a cellular adhesion and signaling receptor that is highly expressed at endothelial cell-cell junctions in confluent vascular beds. Previous studies have implicated PECAM-1 in the maintenance of vascular barrier integrity; however, the mechanisms behind PECAM-1-mediated barrier protection are still poorly understood. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to examine the pertinent biological properties of PECAM-1 (i.e. adhesion and/or signaling) that allow it to support barrier integrity. We found that, compared with PECAM-1-deficient endothelial cells, PECAM-1-expressing endothelial cell monolayers exhibit increased steady-state barrier function, as well as more rapid restoration of barrier integrity following thrombin-induced perturbation of the endothelial cell monolayer. The majority of PECAM-1-mediated barrier protection was found to be due to the ability of PECAM-1 to interact homophilically and become localized to cell-cell junctions, because a homophilic binding-crippled mutant form of PECAM-1 was unable to support efficient barrier function when re-expressed in cells. By contrast, cells expressing PECAM-1 variants lacking residues known to be involved in PECAM-1-mediated signal transduction exhibited normal to near-normal barrier integrity. Taken together, these studies suggest that PECAM-1-PECAM-1 homophilic interactions are more important than its signaling function for maintaining the integrity of endothelial cell junctions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bevan, Heather S</author><author>Slater, Sadie C</author><author>Clarke, Hayley</author><author>Cahill, Paul A</author><author>Mathieson, Peter W</author><author>Welsh, Gavin I</author><author>Satchell, Simon C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute laminar shear stress reversibly increases human glomerular endothelial cell permeability via activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We confirmed eNOS expression by glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) in tissue sections and examined effects of acute exposure (up to 24 h) to physiologically relevant levels of laminar shear stress (10-20 dyn/cm(2)) in conditionally immortalized human GEnC. Laminar shear stress caused an orientation of GEnC and stress fibers parallel to the direction of flow and induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation along with NO production. Inhibition of the phophatidylinositol (PI)3-kinase/Akt pathway attenuated laminar shear stress-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Laminar shear stress of 10 dyn/cm(2) had a dramatic effect on GEnC permeability, reversibly decreasing the electrical resistance across GEnC monolayers. Finally, the laminar shear stress-induced reduction in electrical resistance was attenuated by the NOS inhibitors l-N(G)-monomethyl arginine (l-NMMA) and l-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and also by inhibition of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Hence we have shown for GEnC in vitro that acute permeability responses to laminar shear stress are dependent on NO, produced via activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and increased eNOS phosphorylation. These results suggest the importance of laminar shear stress and NO in regulating the contribution of GEnC to the permeability properties of the glomerular capillary wall.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schlegel, Nicolas</author><author>Meir, Michael</author><author>Spindler, Volker</author><author>Germer, Christoph-Thomas</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential role of Rho GTPases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cellular physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cellular physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1196-1203</pages><volume>226</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>ADP Ribose Transferases</keyword><keyword>ADP Ribose Transferases: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Amides</keyword><keyword>Amides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Botulinum Toxins</keyword><keyword>Botulinum Toxins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Caco-2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Dextrans</keyword><keyword>Dextrans: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Proteins</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: analogs &amp; derivative</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pyridines</keyword><keyword>Pyridines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>20945370</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcp.22446</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Differential role of Rho GTPases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro. - Schlegel, Nicolas; Meir, Michael; Spindler, Volker; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Waschke, Jens)

GTPases of the Rho-family such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are known to be critically involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. However, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these GTPases exerts barrier protection or not. We tested the effects of Rho GTPase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF-1), toxin B, C3 transferase (C3 TF), and lethal toxin (LT) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Incubation of cell monolayers with CNF-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of RhoA whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were unchanged. As revealed by FITC-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. Inhibition of Rho kinase via Y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of CNF-1 after 3 h. In contrast, after 24 h of incubation with CNF-1 only Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA were activated which resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. Toxin B to inactivate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as well as Rac1 inhibitor LT increased intestinal epithelial permeability. Similar effects were observed after inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling by C3 TF or Y27632. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of RhoA signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Chongxiu</author><author>Wu, Mack H</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nonmuscle myosin light-chain kinase deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice via reduced endothelial barrier dysfunction and monocyte migration.</title><secondary-title>Circulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation</full-title></periodical><pages>48-57</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aorta</keyword><keyword>Aorta: pathology</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E: genetics</keyword><keyword>Apolipoproteins E: physiology</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Atherosclerosis: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Collagen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Lipid Metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lipid Metabolism: physiology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: pathology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: physiology</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase: physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tunica Intima</keyword><keyword>Tunica Intima: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: pathology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21670231</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.988915</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3136817&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Endothelial dysfunction and monocyte migration are key events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

The vasculature of the brain is tightly sealed, with blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties developing coincident with neural vascularization. G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124) (tumor endothelial marker 5, TEM5), an orphan member of the adhesion family of G protein-coupled receptors, was previously identified on the basis of its overexpression in tumor vasculature. Here, we show that global deletion or endothelial-specific deletion of GPR124 in mice results in embryonic lethality associated with abnormal angiogenesis of the forebrain and spinal cord. Expression of GPR124 was found to be required for invasion and migration of blood vessels into neuroepithelium, establishment of BBB properties, and expansion of the cerebral cortex. Thus, GPR124 is an important regulator of neurovasculature development and a potential drug target for cerebrovascular diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Xianming</author><author>Tan, Fulong</author><author>Brovkovych, Viktor</author><author>Zhang, Yongkang</author><author>Skidgel, Randal a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-talk between carboxypeptidase M and the kinin B1 receptor mediates a new mode of G protein-coupled receptor signaling.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>18547-18561</pages><volume>286</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Substitution</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin B1</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin B1: agonists</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin B1: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin B1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>GPI-Linked Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kallidin</keyword><keyword>Kallidin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Kallidin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Lung: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Metalloendopeptidases</keyword><keyword>Metalloendopeptidases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Metalloendopeptidases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Missense</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Protein Multimerization</keyword><keyword>Protein Multimerization: physiology</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>3129969179</isbn><accession-num>21454694</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M110.214940</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3099671&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is affected by formation of GPCR homo- or heterodimers, but GPCR regulation by other cell surface proteins is not well understood. We reported that the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) heterodimerizes with membrane carboxypeptidase M (CPM), facilitating receptor signaling via CPM-mediated conversion of bradykinin or kallidin to des-Arg kinin B1R agonists. Here, we found that a catalytically inactive CPM mutant that still binds substrate (CPM-E264Q) also facilitates efficient B1R signaling by B2 receptor agonists bradykinin or kallidin. This response required co-expression of B1R and CPM-E264Q in the same cell, was disrupted by antibody that dissociates CPM from B1R, and was not found with a CPM-E264Q-B1R fusion protein. An additional mutation that reduced the affinity of CPM for C-terminal Arg and increased the affinity for C-terminal Lys inhibited the B1R response to bradykinin (with C-terminal Arg) but generated a response to Lys(9)-bradykinin. CPM-E264Q-mediated activation of B1Rs by bradykinin resulted in increased intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a B1R FRET construct, similar to that generated directly by a B1R agonist. In cytokine-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells, disruption of B1R-CPM heterodimers inhibited B1R-dependent NO production stimulated by bradykinin and blocked the increased endothelial permeability caused by treatment with bradykinin and pyrogallol (a superoxide generator). Thus, CPM and B1Rs on cell membranes form a critical complex that potentiates B1R signaling.

The epithelial di/tripeptide membrane transporter PepT1 is expressed in highly differentiated cells (the villous tip) but not in undifferentiated cells (the crypt) of the small intestine. Here, we investigated the regulation of PepT1 expression by miRNAs and its functional consequences. We observed a reverse correlation between the expression levels of PepT1 and mature miRNA-92b (miR-92b) during the differentiation of intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells, suggesting a miR-92b-mediated regulation of PepT1 expression. We demonstrate that miR-92b suppressed PepT1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, with subsequent reduced PepT1 transport activity, in Caco2-BBE cells by directly targeting the PepT1 3'-untranslated region. In addition, miR-92b suppresses bacterial peptide-induced proinflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells by inhibiting PepT1 expression. Altogether, our study provides for the first time evidence for the regulation of PepT1 expression at a posttranscriptional level by miRNAs in intestinal epithelial cells during pathophysiological states.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Peng</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Ruge, Fiona</author><author>Yang, Yong</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metastasis suppressor-1, MTSS1, acts as a putative tumour suppressor in human bladder cancer.</title><secondary-title>Anticancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>3205-3212</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Tumor Suppressor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Tumor Suppressor Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms: pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21965727</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

The temperature response of poly(2-hydroxymethacrylate) [p(HEMA)]-based hydrogel networks prepared with poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) for enhanced biocompatibility and with N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl] acrylamide (HMMA) was studied. Hydrogels were cross-linked with tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA) and synthesized by UV initiation (2M% DMPA photoinitiator). The p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA) based hydrogels were fabricated as discrete gel pads (D=2.5 mm, H=2 mm and V=9.82 μL) on top of 250 μm diameter cysteamine modified and acryloyl (polyethylene glycol)(110) N-hydroxy succinamide ester (acryloyl-PEG-NHS) derivatized gold microelectrodes set within 8-well (8W1E) cell culture biochips. Gel pads were fabricated with cross-link densities corresponding to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 M% TEGDA and were studied by frequency dependent 3-electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (1 mHz to 100 kHz; 50 mV p-t-p) and by temporal 2-electrode impedimetry (64 kHz; 50 mV p-t-p) over the temperature range 30-45°C at 90% RH or in aqueous 0.1 M Tris/KCl at pH 7.2 buffer. The p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA) hydrogels showed an increase in the real component of impedance with increasing cross-link density and demonstrated activation energies for impedimetric transport that ranged from 15 kJ/mol (3 M%) to 20 kJ/mol (12 M%) confirming the dominance of proton migration in the impedance of the hydrogels.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baumer, Yvonne</author><author>Scholz, Beate</author><author>Ivanov, Svetlana</author><author>Schlosshauer, Burkhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Telomerase-based immortalization modifies the angiogenic/inflammatory responses of human coronary artery endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)</full-title></periodical><pages>692-700</pages><volume>236</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>LDL</keyword><keyword>LDL: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Physiologic</keyword><keyword>Telomerase</keyword><keyword>Telomerase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Telomerase: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21558092</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1258/ebm.2011.010300</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Telomerase-based immortalization modifies the angiogenic/inflammatory responses of human coronary artery endothelial cells. - Baumer, Yvonne; Scholz, Beate; Ivanov, Svetlana; Schlosshauer, Burkhard)

To address the question whether the enhancement of the proliferative potential hampers cell differentiation, we generated TERT-over-expressing endothelial cells (ECs) and analyzed in vitro their (1) barrier function; (2) low-density lipoprotein uptake; (3) expression pattern of six selected marker proteins; (4) angiogenic potential in four assays; and (5) inflammatory responses. In contrast to investigations with focus on other cell parameters, we demonstrate that immortalization of ECs by over-expression of TERT resulted in different angiogenic and inflammatory behavior in comparison to cells with low native telomerase levels.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarantola, Marco</author><author>Pietuch, Anna</author><author>Schneider, David</author><author>Rother, Jan</author><author>Sunnick, Eva</author><author>Rosman, Christina</author><author>Pierrat, Sebastien</author><author>Sönnichsen, Carsten</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toxicity of gold-nanoparticles: synergistic effects of shape and surface functionalization on micromotility of epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Nanotoxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanotoxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>254-268</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cetrimonium Compounds</keyword><keyword>Cetrimonium Compounds: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Gold: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Particle Size</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Surface Properties</keyword><keyword>Surface-Active Agents</keyword><keyword>Surface-Active Agents: chemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21050076</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/17435390.2010.528847</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21050076</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Nanoparticle exposure is monitored by a combination of two label-free and non-invasive biosensor devices which detect cellular shape and viscoelasticity (quartz crystal microbalance), cell motility and the dynamics of epithelial cell-cell contacts (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing). With these tools we have studied the impact of nanoparticle shape on cellular physiology. Gold (Au) nanoparticles coated with CTAB were synthesized and studied in two distinct shapes: Spheres with a diameter of (43 ± 4) nm and rods with a size of (38 ± 7) nm × (17 ± 3) nm. Dose-response experiments were accompanied by conventional cytotoxicity tests as well as fluorescence and dark-field microscopy to visualize the intracellular particle distribution. We found that spherical gold nanoparticles with identical surface functionalization are generally more toxic and more efficiently ingested than rod-shaped particles. We largely attribute the higher toxicity of CTAB-coated spheres as compared to rod-shaped particles to a higher release of toxic CTAB upon intracellular aggregation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alvarez, Jorge Ivan</author><author>Dodelet-Devillers, Aurore</author><author>Kebir, Hania</author><author>Ifergan, Igal</author><author>Fabre, Pierre J</author><author>Terouz, Simone</author><author>Sabbagh, Mike</author><author>Wosik, Karolina</author><author>Bourbonniere, L.</author><author>Bernard, Monique</author><author>van Horssen, Jack</author><author>de Vries, Helga E</author><author>Charron, Frédéric</author><author>Prat, Alexandre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Hedgehog Pathway Promotes Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity and CNS Immune Quiescence</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1727-1731</pages><volume>334</volume><issue>6063</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Astrocytes</keyword><keyword>Astrocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: cytology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: immunology</keyword><keyword>Brain: physiology</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chemokines</keyword><keyword>Chemokines: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Encephalomyelitis</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Experimental</keyword><keyword>Experimental: immun</keyword><keyword>Experimental: immunology</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metab</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Hedgehog Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Multiple Sclerosis</keyword><keyword>Multiple Sclerosis: immunology</keyword><keyword>Multiple Sclerosis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Veratrum Alkaloids</keyword><keyword>Veratrum Alkaloids: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22144466</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1206936</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (The Hedgehog pathway promotes blood-brain barrier integrity and CNS immune quiescence. - Alvarez, Jorge Ivan; Dodelet-Devillers, Aurore; Kebir, Hania; Ifergan, Igal; Fabre, Pierre J; Terouz, Simone; Sabbagh, Mike; Wosik, Karolina; Bourbonnière, Lyne; Bernard, Monique; van Horssen, Jack; de Vries, Helga E; Charron, Frédéric; Prat, Alexandre)

Here, we show that astrocytes secrete Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and that BBB-ECs express Hh receptors, which together promote BBB formation and integrity during embryonic development and adulthood. Using pharmacological inhibition and genetic inactivation of the Hh signaling pathway in ECs, we also demonstrate a critical role of the Hh pathway in promoting immune quiescence of BBB-ECs by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory mediators and the adhesion and migration of leukocytes, in vivo and in vitro. Overall, the Hh pathway provides a barrier-promoting effect and an endogenous anti-inflammatory balance to CNS-directed immune attacks, as occurs in multiple sclerosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xue, Meilang</author><author>Chow, Shu-Oi</author><author>Dervish, Suat</author><author>Chan, Yee-Ka Agnes</author><author>Julovi, Sohel M</author><author>Jackson, Christopher J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activated protein C enhances human keratinocyte barrier integrity via sequential activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and Tie2.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>6742-6750</pages><volume>286</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: physiology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: cytology</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: genetics</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Peptides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein C</keyword><keyword>Protein C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>TIE-2</keyword><keyword>TIE-2: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21173154</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M110.181388</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3057790&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Keratinocytes play a critical role in maintaining epidermal barrier function. Activated protein C (APC), a natural anticoagulant with anti-inflammatory and endothelial barrier protective properties, significantly increased the barrier impedance of keratinocyte monolayers, measured by electric cell substrate impedance sensing and FITC-dextran flux. In response to APC, Tie2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, was rapidly activated within 30 min, and relocated to cell-cell contacts. APC also increased junction proteins zona occludens, claudin-1 and VE-cadherin. Inhibition of Tie2 by its peptide inhibitor or small interfering RNA abolished the barrier protective effect of APC. Interestingly, APC did not activate Tie2 through its major ligand, angiopoietin-1, but instead acted by binding to endothelial protein C receptor, cleaving protease-activated receptor-1 and transactivating EGF receptor. Furthermore, when activation of Akt, but not ERK, was inhibited, the barrier protective effect of APC on keratinocytes was abolished. Thus, APC activates Tie2, via a mechanism requiring, in sequential order, the receptors, endothelial protein C receptor, protease-activated receptor-1, and EGF receptor, which selectively enhances the PI3K/Akt signaling to enhance junctional complexes and reduce keratinocyte permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kakiashvili, Eli</author><author>Dan, Qinghong</author><author>Vandermeer, Matthew</author><author>Zhang, Yuqian</author><author>Waheed, Faiza</author><author>Pham, Monica</author><author>Szászi, Katalin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The epidermal growth factor receptor mediates tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced activation of the ERK/GEF-H1/RhoA pathway in tubular epithelium.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>9268-9279</pages><volume>286</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: genetics</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: geneti</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: metabo</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Proximal</keyword><keyword>Proximal: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: genetics</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Urothelium</keyword><keyword>Urothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21212278</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M110.179903</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3059019&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induces cytoskeleton and intercellular junction remodeling in tubular epithelial cells; the underlying mechanisms, however, are incompletely explored. We have previously shown that ERK-mediated stimulation of the RhoA GDP/GTP exchange factor GEF-H1/Lfc is critical for TNF-α-induced RhoA stimulation. Here we investigated the upstream mechanisms of ERK/GEF-H1 activation. Surprisingly, TNF-α-induced ERK and RhoA stimulation in tubular cells were prevented by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition or silencing. TNF-α also enhanced phosphorylation of the EGFR. EGF treatment mimicked the effects of TNF-α, as it elicited potent, ERK-dependent GEF-H1 and RhoA activation. Moreover, EGF-induced RhoA activation was prevented by GEF-H1 silencing, indicating that GEF-H1 is a key downstream effector of the EGFR. The TNF-α-elicited EGFR, ERK, and RhoA stimulation were mediated by the TNF-α convertase enzyme (TACE) that can release EGFR ligands. Further, EGFR transactivation also required the tyrosine kinase Src, as Src inhibition prevented TNF-α-induced activation of the EGFR/ERK/GEF-H1/RhoA pathway. Importantly, a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and electric cell substrate impedance-sensing (ECIS) measurements revealed that TNF-α stimulated cell growth in an EGFR-dependent manner. In contrast, TNF-α-induced NFκB activation was not prevented by EGFR or Src inhibition, suggesting that TNF-α exerts both EGFR-dependent and -independent effects. In summary, in the present study we show that the TNF-α-induced activation of the ERK/GEF-H1/RhoA pathway in tubular cells is mediated through Src- and TACE-dependent EGFR activation. Such a mechanism could couple inflammatory and proliferative stimuli and, thus, may play a key role in the regulation of wound healing and fibrogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bagnaninchi, Pierre O</author><author>Drummond, Nicola</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time label-free monitoring of adipose-derived stem cell differentiation with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>6462-6467</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Adipose Tissue</keyword><keyword>Adipose Tissue: cytology</keyword><keyword>Adipose Tissue: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Osteogenesis</keyword><keyword>Osteogenesis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Stem Cells</keyword><keyword>Stem Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Stem Cells: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21464296</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1018260108</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Real-time label-free monitoring of adipose-derived stem cell differentiation with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. - Bagnaninchi, Pierre O; Drummond, Nicola)

We cultured adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on top of multielectrode arrays and measured variations in the complex impedance Z* throughout induction of ADSCs toward osteoblasts and adipocytes. Z* was measured up to 17 d, every 180 s, over a 62.5-64 kHz frequency range with an ECIS Z instrument. We found that osteogenesis and adipogenesis were characterized by distinct Z* time-courses. Significant differences were found (P = 0.007) as soon as 12 h post induction. An increase in the barrier resistance (Rb) up to 1.7 ohm·cm(2) was associated with early osteo-induction, whereas Rb peaked at 0.63 ohm·cm(2) for adipo-induced cells before falling to zero at t = 129 h. Dissimilarities in Z* throughout early induction (&lt;24 h) were essentially attributed to variations in the cell-substrate parameter α. Four days after induction, cell membrane capacitance (Cm) of osteo-induced cells (Cm = 1.72 ± 0.10 μF/cm(2)) was significantly different from that of adipo-induced cells (Cm = 2.25 ± 0.27 μF/cm(2)), indicating that Cm could be used as an early marker of differentiation. Finally, we demonstrated long-term monitoring and measured a shift in the complex plane in the middle frequency range (1 kHz to 8 kHz) between early (t = 100 h) and late induction (t = 380 h). This study demonstrated that the osteoblast and adipocyte lineages have distinct dielectric properties and that such differences can be used to perform real-time label-free quantitative monitoring of adult stem cell differentiation with impedance sensing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarantola, Marco</author><author>Sunnick, Eva</author><author>Schneider, David</author><author>Marel, Anna-Kristina</author><author>Kunze, Angelika</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic changes of acoustic load and complex impedance as reporters for the cytotoxicity of small molecule inhibitors.</title><secondary-title>Chemical research in toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical research in toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>1494-1506</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21815656</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/tx200115q</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Dynamic changes of acoustic load and complex impedance as reporters for the cytotoxicity of small molecule inhibitors. - Tarantola, Marco; Sunnick, Eva; Schneider, David; Marel, Anna-Kristina; Kunze, Angelika; Janshoff, Andreas)

We studied the response of epithelial FaDu monolayers cultured on gold electrodes of an acoustic resonator (quartz crystal microbalance, QCM) and impedance sensor (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, ECIS) to externally applied chemical stimuli interfering with cytoskeleton organization. Epithelial cell motility of confluent monolayers is characterized by subtle cell shape changes and variations in the cell-substrate as well as cell-cell distance without net directionality of individual cells. The impact of small molecules such as cytochalasin D, phalloidin, and blebbistatin as well as paclitaxel, nocodazol, and colchicin on actin and microtubules organization was quantified by conventional sensors' readouts and by comparing the noise pattern of the signals which is attributed to cellular dynamics. The responsiveness of noninvasive and label-free techniques relying on cellular dynamics is compared to classical viability assays and changes of the overall impedance of ultrasmall electrodes or acoustic loads of a thickness shear mode resonator. Depending on the agent used, a distinct sensor response was found, which can be used as a fingerprint of the cellular response. Cytoskeletal rearrangements and nuclear integrity were corroborated by fluorescence microscopy and correlated to the readouts of QCM and ECIS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herron, Crystal R</author><author>Lowery, Anthony M</author><author>Hollister, Patricia R</author><author>Reynolds, Albert B</author><author>Vincent, Peter a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p120 regulates endothelial permeability independently of its NH2 terminus and Rho binding.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

To distinguish whether decreased TEER was due to a loss of p120 and not to the decrease in VE-cadherin, we established a system in which p120 was depleted by short hairpin RNA delivered by lentivirus and VE-cadherin was restored via expression of VE-cadherin fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Loss of p120 resulted in decreased TEER, which was associated with decreased expression of VE-cadherin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, and α-catenin. Decreased TEER was rescued by restoration of p120 but not by the expression of VE-cadherin-GFP, despite localization of VE-cadherin-GFP at cell-cell borders. Expression of VE-cadherin-GFP restored levels of β-catenin and α-catenin but not plakoglobin, indicating that p120 may be important for recruitment of plakoglobin to the VE-cadherin complex. To evaluate the role of p120 interaction with Rho GTPase in regulating endothelial permeability, we expressed a recombinant form of p120, lacking the NH(2) terminus and containing alanine substitutions, that eliminates binding of Rho to p120. Expression of this isoform restored expression of the adherens junction complex and rescued permeability as measured by TEER. These results demonstrate that p120 is required for maintaining VE-cadherin expression and TEER independently of its NH(2) terminus and its role in regulating Rho.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebrahimi, Celia M</author><author>Sheen, Tamsin R</author><author>Renken, Christian W</author><author>Gottlieb, Roberta a</author><author>Doran, Kelly S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contribution of lethal toxin and edema toxin to the pathogenesis of anthrax meningitis.</title><secondary-title>Infection and immunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection and immunity</full-title></periodical><pages>2510-2518</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Anthrax</keyword><keyword>Anthrax: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Anthrax: mortality</keyword><keyword>Anthrax: pathology</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Autophagy</keyword><keyword>Bacillus anthracis</keyword><keyword>Bacillus anthracis: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacillus anthracis: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: mortality</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: pathology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: pathology</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Brain: pathology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Meningitis</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: pathology</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21518787</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/IAI.00006-11</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3191953&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS Invasion;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax disease in humans and animals. Systemic infection is characterized by septicemia, toxemia, and meningitis, the main neurological complication associated with high mortality. We have shown previously that B. anthracis Sterne is capable of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, establishing the classic signs of meningitis, and that infection is dependent on the expression of both major anthrax toxins, lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET). Here we further investigate the contribution of the individual toxins to BBB disruption using isogenic toxin mutants deficient in lethal factor, ΔLF, and edema factor, ΔEF. Acute infection with B. anthracis Sterne and the ΔLF mutant resulted in disruption of human brain microvascular endothelial cell (hBMEC) monolayer integrity and tight junction protein zona occludens-1, while the result for cells infected with the ΔEF mutant was similar to that for the noninfected control. A significant decrease in bacterial invasion of BBB endothelium in vitro was observed during infection with the ΔLF strain, suggesting a prominent role for LT in promoting BBB interaction. Further, treatment of hBMECs with purified LT or chemicals that mimic LT action on host signaling pathways rescued the hypoinvasive phenotype of the ΔLF mutant and resulted in increased bacterial uptake. We also observed that toxin expression reduced bacterial intracellular survival by inducing the bulk degradative autophagy pathway in host cells. Finally, in a murine model of anthrax meningitis, mice infected with the ΔLF mutant exhibited no mortality, brain bacterial load, or evidence of meningitis compared to mice infected with the parental or ΔEF strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raufman, Jean-Pierre</author><author>Cheng, Kunrong</author><author>Saxena, Neeraj</author><author>Chahdi, Ahmed</author><author>Belo, Angelica</author><author>Khurana, Sandeep</author><author>Xie, Guofeng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Muscarinic receptor agonists stimulate matrix metalloproteinase 1-dependent invasion of human colon cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</full-title></periodical><pages>319-324</pages><volume>415</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetylcholine</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>HT29 Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 1</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 1: genetics</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Muscarinic</keyword><keyword>Muscarinic Agonists</keyword><keyword>Muscarinic Agonists: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Muscarinic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Taurodeoxycholic Acid</keyword><keyword>Taurodeoxycholic Acid: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>22027145</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.052</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3221914&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mammalian matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which degrade extracellular matrix facilitate colon cancer cell invasion into the bloodstream and extra-colonic tissues; in particular, MMP1 expression correlates strongly with advanced colon cancer stage, hematogenous metastasis and poor prognosis. Likewise, muscarinic receptor signaling plays an important role in colon cancer; muscarinic receptors are over-expressed in colon cancer compared to normal colon epithelial cells. Muscarinic receptor activation stimulates proliferation, migration and invasion of human colon cancer cells. In mouse intestinal neoplasia models genetic ablation of muscarinic receptors attenuates carcinogenesis. In the present work, we sought to link these observations by showing that MMP1 expression and activation plays a mechanistic role in muscarinic receptor agonist-induced colon cancer cell invasion. We show that acetylcholine, which robustly increases MMP1 expression, stimulates invasion of HT29 and H508 human colon cancer cells into human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers - this was abolished by pre-incubation with atropine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor inhibitor, and by pre-incubation with anti-MMP1 neutralizing antibody. Similar results were obtained using a Matrigel chamber assay and deoxycholyltaurine (DCT), an amidated dihydroxy bile acid associated with colon neoplasia in animal models and humans, and previously shown to interact functionally with muscarinic receptors. DCT treatment of human colon cancer cells resulted in time-dependent, 10-fold increased MMP1 expression, and DCT-induced cell invasion was also blocked by pre-treatment with anti-MMP1 antibody. This study contributes to understanding mechanisms underlying muscarinic receptor agonist-induced promotion of colon cancer and, more importantly, indicates that blocking MMP1 expression and activation has therapeutic promise to stop or retard colon cancer invasion and dissemination.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, a</author><author>Fridén, V</author><author>Dasgupta, I</author><author>Foster, R R</author><author>Welsh, G I</author><author>Tooke, J E</author><author>Haraldsson, B</author><author>Mathieson, P W</author><author>Satchell, S C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High glucose causes dysfunction of the human glomerular endothelial glycocalyx.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

The glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) glycocalyx is composed of proteoglycan core proteins, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, and sialoglycoproteins and has been shown to contribute to the selective sieving action of the glomerular capillary wall. Damage to the systemic endothelial glycocalyx has recently been associated with the onset of albuminuria in diabetics. In this study, we analyze the effects of high glucose on the biochemical structure of the GEnC glycocalyx and quantify functional changes in its protein-restrictive action. We used conditionally immortalized human GEnC. Proteoglycans were analyzed by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence. Biosynthesis of GAG was analyzed by radiolabeling and quantified by anion exchange chromatography. FITC-albumin was used to analyze macromolecular passage across GEnC monolayers using an established in vitro model. We observed a marked reduction in the biosynthesis of GAG by the GEnC under high-glucose conditions. Further analysis confirmed specific reduction in heparan sulfate GAG. Expression of proteoglycan core proteins remained unchanged. There was also a significant increase in the passage of albumin across GEnC monolayers under high-glucose conditions without affecting interendothelial junctions. These results reproduce changes in GEnC barrier properties caused by enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate from the GEnC glycocalyx. They provide direct evidence of high glucose-induced alterations in the GEnC glycocalyx and demonstrate changes to its function as a protein-restrictive layer, thus implicating glycocalyx damage in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in diabetes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

Migration;Signal Transduction;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Molecular effects of obesity, a well-established risk factor for breast cancer progression, are mediated by adipocytokine leptin. Given the important role of leptin in breast cancer growth and metastasis, novel strategies to antagonize biological effects of this adipocytokine are much desired. We showed previously that benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables (e.g. garden cress), confers significant protection against mammary carcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model. The present study provides first evidence for the efficacy of BITC against oncogenic effects of leptin. The BITC treatment circumvented leptin-induced clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Leptin-stimulated migration and invasion of these cells was also inhibited in the presence of BITC. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that BITC treatment suppressed leptin-induced Stat3 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 transactivation. The BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth correlated with a modest yet significant decrease in levels of Tyr705 phosphorylated Stat3. The BITC treatment efficiently inhibited Stat3 and SRC1 recruitment to cyclin D1 promoter in a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active Stat3 imparted significant protection against BITC-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transactivation, whereas RNA interference of Stat3 resulted in a significant increase in BITC-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transactivation in the presence of leptin. These results indicate that Stat3 plays an important role in BITC-mediated inhibition of leptin-induced cyclin D1 transactivation. In conclusion, BITC could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma in obese patients with high leptin levels.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>von Wedel-Parlow, Magdalena</author><author>Schrot, Sebastian</author><author>Lemmen, Julia</author><author>Treeratanapiboon, Lertyot</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Galla, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neutrophils cross the BBB primarily on transcellular pathways: an in vitro study.</title><secondary-title>Brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain research</full-title></periodical><pages>62-76</pages><volume>1367</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Atomic Force</keyword><keyword>Atomic Force: methods</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electron</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Fluoresceins</keyword><keyword>Fluoresceins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: physiology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Scanning</keyword><keyword>Scanning: methods</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Transcytosis</keyword><keyword>Transcytosis: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>20875807</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.brainres.2010.09.076</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875807</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>The cerebral microcapillary endothelium forms a highly important barrier between the blood and the interstitial fluid of the brain (blood-brain barrier) that controls the passage of molecules and cells in and out of the CNS. Several CNS diseases include leukocyte extravasation through the endothelium via two mechanistically distinct routes, the paracellular and the transcellular pathway. We established a new in vitro model of the inflamed blood-brain barrier consisting of primary cultured porcine brain capillary endothelial cells which express a tight endothelial barrier even under inflammatory conditions. By means of this specialized blood-brain barrier model we extensively studied the transmigration of neutrophils. Electron and scanning force microscopy as well as immunofluorescence imaging captured the penetrating neutrophil on the endothelial cellular body in between the junctions clearly suggesting a transcellular migration pathway. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing and transendothelial electrical resistance measurements in combination with expression analysis of tight junction proteins demonstrate that the neutrophil-endothelial interaction does not disrupt the barrier. In conclusion, this study, based on an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier under inflammatory conditions, evidently implicates that neutrophils preferentially migrate across the BBB via the transcellular route without impairing endothelial barrier function whereas paracellular transmigration plays only a minor role if the barrier is strongly expressed.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGuire, Paul G</author><author>Rangasamy, Sampathkumar</author><author>Maestas, Joann</author><author>Das, Arup</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pericyte-derived sphinogosine 1-phosphate induces the expression of adhesion proteins and modulates the retinal endothelial cell barrier.</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e107-15</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21940944</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.235408</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3225006&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The mechanisms that regulate the physical interaction of pericytes and endothelial cells and the effects of these interactions on interendothelial cell junctions are not well understood.

However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate these events are not clearly defined. Herein, we identify a previously unexpected role for adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) repair. PMVECs selectively express the AMPKα1 catalytic subunit, pharmacological and short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of which attenuates Ca(2+) entry in these cells induced by the inflammatory Ca(2+)-signaling mimetic thapsigargin. We find that AMPKα1 activity is required for the formation of PMVEC cell-cell networks in a prorepair environment and for monolayer resealing after wounding. Decreasing AMPKα1 expression reduces barrier resistance in PMVEC monolayers, results consistent with a role for AMPKα1 in cell-cell adhesion. AMPKα1 colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with the adherens junction protein N-cadherin and cofractionates with proteins selectively expressed in caveolar membranes. Assessment of permeability, by measuring the filtration coefficient (K(f)) in isolated perfused lungs, confirmed that AMPK activation contributes to barrier repair in vivo. Our findings thus provide novel evidence for AMPKα1 in Ca(2+) influx-mediated signaling and wound repair in the endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Minshall, Richard D</author><author>Vandenbroucke, Emily E</author><author>Holinstat, Michael</author><author>Place, Aaron T</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Vogel, Stephen M</author><author>van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten P</author><author>Mehta, Dolly</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of protein kinase Czeta in thrombin-induced RhoA activation and inter-endothelial gap formation of human dermal microvessel endothelial cell monolayers.</title><secondary-title>Microvascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microvascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>240-249</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Benzophenanthridines</keyword><keyword>Benzophenanthridines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling: physiology</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cytosol</keyword><keyword>Cytosol: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cytosol: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dermis</keyword><keyword>Dermis: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Dermis: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Gene Silencing</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microfilaments</keyword><keyword>Microfilaments: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microfilaments: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: cytology</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microvessels: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: biosynthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>20417648</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mvr.2010.04.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Role of protein kinase Czeta in thrombin-induced RhoA activation and inter-endothelial gap formation of human dermal microvessel endothelial cell monolayers. - Minshall, Richard D; Vandenbroucke, Emily E; Holinstat, Michael; Place, Aaron T; Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy; Vogel, Stephen M; van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten P; Mehta, Dolly; Malik, Asrar B)

Studies were done using human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HMEC), which we showed constitutively expressed PKCzeta. We quantified the patency of inter-endothelial junctions (IEJs) and endothelial barrier function by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) in confluent HMEC monolayers. In control monolayers, thrombin decreased TER by approximately 50%, indicating thrombin-dependent opening of IEJs. Thrombin also elicited increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](i), actin stress fiber formation, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Pan-PKC inhibitors, calphostin C and chelerythrine, abrogated these responses. Thrombin also decreased TER after depletion of conventional and novel Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isoforms using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In these PMA-treated cells, thrombin induced inter-endothelial gap formation, MLC phosphorylation, and actin stress fiber formation, but failed to increase [Ca(2+)](i). Inhibition of PKCzeta activation using the PKCzeta pseudosubstrate peptide (PSI), depletion of PKCzeta protein with siRNA, and competitive inhibition of PKCzeta activity using dominant-negative (dn) PKCzeta mutant all prevented the thrombin-induced decrease in TER and MLC phosphorylation. Expression of dn-PKCzeta also inhibited thrombin-induced RhoA activation. These findings reveal a novel Ca(2+)-independent, PKCzeta-dependent mechanism of thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability. The results raise the possibility that inhibition of PKCzeta may be a novel drug target for thrombin-induced inflammatory hyperpermeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramirez, Servio H</author><author>Fan, Shongshan</author><author>Zhang, Ming</author><author>Papugani, Anil</author><author>Reichenbach, Nancy</author><author>Dykstra, Holly</author><author>Mercer, Aaron J</author><author>Tuma, Ronald F</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) decreases inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>881-892</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>AIDS Dementia Complex</keyword><keyword>AIDS Dementia Complex: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>AIDS Dementia Complex: metabolism</keyword><keyword>AIDS Dementia Complex: pathology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: pathology</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Brain: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Brain: pathology</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Drug Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Encephalitis: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: immunology</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3: antagonists &amp; inhibito</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators</keyword><keyword>Inflammation Mediators: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Preclinical</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Thiadiazoles</keyword><keyword>Thiadiazoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thiadiazoles: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Thiazoles</keyword><keyword>Thiazoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thiazoles: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Urea</keyword><keyword>Urea: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Urea: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Urea: therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20056834</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2353/ajpath.2010.090671</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2808093&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Immune mediators and leukocyte engagement of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) contribute to blood-brain barrier impairment during neuroinflammation.

Here we evaluated the effect of GSK3beta inhibition on the regulation of inflammatory responses in BMVECs. A focused PCR gene array of 84 genes was performed to identify the cytokine and chemokine gene expression profile in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-stimulated BMVECs after GSK3beta inactivation by specific inhibitors. Fifteen of 39 genes induced by TNFalpha stimulation were down-regulated after GSK3beta inhibition. Genes known to contribute to neuroinflammation that were most negatively affected by GSK3beta inactivation included IP-10/CXCL10, MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, RANTES/CCL5, and Groalpha/CXCL1. GSK3beta suppression resulted in diminished secretion of these proinflammatory mediators by inflamed BMVECs detected by ELISA. GSK3beta inhibition in BMVECs reduced adhesion molecule expression as well as monocyte adhesion to and migration across cytokine stimulated BMVEC monolayers. Interactions of monocytes with TNFalpha-activated BMVECs led to barrier disruption, and GSK3beta suppression in the endothelium restored barrier integrity. GSK3beta inhibition in vivo substantially decreased leukocyte adhesion to brain endothelium under inflammatory conditions. In summary, inhibition of GSK3beta emerges as an important target for stabilization of the blood-brain barrier in neuroinflammation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zhen</author><author>Ginnan, Roman</author><author>Abdullaev, Iskandar F</author><author>Trebak, Mohamed</author><author>Vincent, Peter a</author><author>Singer, Harold a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 6 (CaMKIIdelta6) and RhoA involvement in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>21303-21312</pages><volume>285</volume><issue>28</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: pathology</keyword><keyword>Enzymologic</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: metabo</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Protein Isoforms</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0040420000</isbn><accession-num>20442409</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M110.120790</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 6 (CaMKIIdelta6) and RhoA involvement in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. - Wang, Zhen; Ginnan, Roman; Abdullaev, Iskandar F; Trebak, Mohamed; Vincent, Peter a; Singer, Harold a)

In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) as a mediator of thrombin-stimulated increases in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer permeability. For the first time, we identified the CaMKIIdelta(6) isoform as the predominant CaMKII isoform expressed in endothelium. As little as 2.5 nM thrombin maximally increased CaMKIIdelta(6) activation assessed by Thr(287) autophosphorylation. Electroporation of siRNA targeting endogenous CaMKIIdelta (siCaMKIIdelta) suppressed expression of the kinase by &gt;80% and significantly inhibited 2.5 nM thrombin-induced increases in monolayer permeability assessed by electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). siCaMKIIdelta inhibited 2.5 nM thrombin-induced activation of RhoA, but had no effect on thrombin-induced ERK1/2 activation. Although Rho kinase inhibition strongly suppressed thrombin-induced HUVEC hyperpermeability, inhibiting ERK1/2 activation had no effect. In contrast to previous reports, these results indicate that thrombin-induced ERK1/2 activation in endothelial cells is not mediated by CaMKII and is not involved in endothelial barrier hyperpermeability. Instead, CaMKIIdelta(6) mediates thrombin-induced HUVEC barrier dysfunction through RhoA/Rho kinase as downstream intermediates. Moreover, the relative contribution of the CaMKIIdelta(6)/RhoA pathway(s) diminished with increasing thrombin stimulation, indicating recruitment of alternative signaling pathways mediating endothelial barrier dysfunction, dependent upon thrombin concentration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patani, Neill</author><author>Douglas-Jones, Anthony</author><author>Mansel, Robert</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Mokbel, Kefah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tumour suppressor function of MDA-7/IL-24 in human breast cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell international</full-title></periodical><pages>29</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20735832</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1475-2867-10-29</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

This study attempted to explore effects of different negative pressures on epithelial migration in the wound-healing process. The electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technique was used to create a 5 x 10(-4) cm(2) wound in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. The wounded cells were cultured in a negative pressure incubator at ambient pressure (AP) and negative pressures of 75 mmHg (NP(75)), 125 mmHg (NP(125)), and 175 mmHg (NP(175)). The effective time (ET), complete wound healing time (T(max)), healing rate (R(heal)), cell diameter, and wound area over time at different pressures were evaluated. Traditional wound-healing assays were prepared for fluorescent staining of cells viability, cell junction proteins, including ZO-1 and E-cadherin, and actins. Amount of cell junction proteins at AP and NP(125) was also quantified. In MDCK cells, the ET (1.25 +/- 0.27 h), T(max) (1.76 +/- 0.32 h), and R(heal) (2.94 +/- 0.62 x 10(-4) cm(2)/h) at NP(125) were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different from those at three other pressure conditions. In HaCaT cells, the T(max) (7.34 +/- 0.29 h) and R(heal) (6.82 +/- 0.26 x 10(-5) cm(2)/h) at NP(125) were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different from those at NP(75). Prominent cell migration features were identified in cells at the specific negative pressure. Cell migration activities at different pressures can be documented with the real-time wound-healing measurement system. Negative pressure of 125 mmHg can help disassemble the cell junction to enhance epithelial migration and subsequently result in quick wound closure.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Dipali</author><author>Wang, Jason</author><author>Fu, Ping P</author><author>Sharma, Shvetank</author><author>Nagalingam, Arumugam</author><author>Mells, Jamie</author><author>Handy, Jeffrey</author><author>Page, Andrew J</author><author>Cohen, Cynthia</author><author>Anania, Frank A</author><author>Saxena, Neeraj K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adiponectin antagonizes the oncogenic actions of leptin in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1713-1722</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adiponectin</keyword><keyword>Adiponectin: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: genetics</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: pathology</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Heterologous</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>In Situ Nick-End Labeling</keyword><keyword>Leptin</keyword><keyword>Leptin: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Leptin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm: analysis</keyword><keyword>Nude</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Obesity: complications</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Transplantation</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20941777</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hep.23892</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2967627&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>UNLABELLED: Obesity is rapidly becoming a pandemic and is associated with increased carcinogenesis. Obese populations have higher circulating levels of leptin in contrast to low concentrations of adiponectin. Hence, it is important to evaluate the dynamic role between adiponectin and leptin in obesity-related carcinogenesis. Recently, we reported the oncogenic role of leptin including its potential to increase tumor invasiveness and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the present study we investigated whether adiponectin could antagonize the oncogenic actions of leptin in HCC. We employed HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh7, the nude mice-xenograft model of HCC, and immunohistochemistry data from tissue-microarray to demonstrate the antagonistic role of adiponectin on the oncogenic actions of leptin. Adiponectin treatment inhibited leptin-induced cell proliferation of HCC cells. Using scratch-migration and electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing-based migration assays, we found that adiponectin inhibited leptin-induced migration of HCC cells. Adiponectin treatment effectively blocked leptin-induced invasion of HCC cells in Matrigel invasion assays. Although leptin inhibited apoptosis in HCC cells, we found that adiponectin treatment induced apoptosis even in the presence of leptin. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that adiponectin treatment reduced leptin-induced Stat3 and Akt phosphorylation. Adiponectin also increased suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3), a physiologic negative regulator of leptin signal transduction. Importantly, adiponectin significantly reduced leptin-induced tumor burden in nude mice. In HCC samples, leptin expression significantly correlated with HCC proliferation as evaluated by Ki-67, whereas adiponectin expression correlated significantly with increased disease-free survival and inversely with tumor size and local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data demonstrate that adiponectin has the molecular potential to inhibit the oncogenic actions of leptin by blocking downstream effector molecules.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahmoud, Khaled A</author><author>Mena, Jimmy A</author><author>Male, Keith B</author><author>Hrapovic, Sabahudin</author><author>Kamen, Amine</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of surface charge on the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of fluorescent labeled cellulose nanocrystals.</title><secondary-title>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</full-title></periodical><pages>2924-2932</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cellulose</keyword><keyword>Cellulose: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cellulose: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>HEK293 Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Rhodamines</keyword><keyword>Rhodamines: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Rhodamines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Spodoptera</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20919683</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/am1006222</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20919683</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Probing of cellular uptake and cytotoxicity was conducted for two fluorescent cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs): CNC-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and newly synthesized CNC-rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC). The positively charged CNC-RBITC was uptaken by human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells without affecting the cell membrane integrity. The cell viability assay and cell-based impedance spectroscopy revealed no noticeably cytotoxic effect of the CNC-RBITC conjugate. However, no significant internalization of negatively charged CNC-FITC was observed at physiological pH. Indeed, the effector cells were surrounded by CNC-FITC, leading to eventual cell rupture. As the surface charge of CNC played an important role in cellular uptake and cytotoxicity, facile surface functionalization together with observed noncytotoxicity rendered modified CNC as a promising candidate for bioimaging and drug delivery systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, Seok</author><author>Sudo, Ryo</author><author>Vickerman, Vernella</author><author>Zervantonakis, Ioannis K</author><author>Kamm, Roger D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microfluidic Platforms for Studies of Angiogenesis, Cell Migration, and Cell–Cell Interactions</title><secondary-title>Annals of Biomedical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Biomedical Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1164-1177</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Cell culture</keyword><keyword>Liver</keyword><keyword>Tissue engineering</keyword><keyword>Vascular networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10439-010-9899-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10439-010-9899-3</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recent advances in microfluidic technologies have opened the door for creating more realistic in vitro cell culture methods that replicate many aspects of the true in vivo microenvironment.

Listeriolysin (LLO), the main virulence factor of Listeria monocytogenes, induces a dose-dependent hyperpermeability in monolayers of human lung microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. The permeability increasing activity of LLO, which is accompanied by an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, RhoA activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, can be completely inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) alpha/beta inhibitor GO6976, indicating a crucial role for PKC in the induction of barrier dysfunction. The TNF-derived TIP peptide, which mimics the lectin-like domain of the cytokine, blunts LLO-induced hyperpermeability in vitro, upon inhibiting LLO-induced protein kinase C-alpha activation, ROS generation and MLC phosphorylation and upon restoring the RhoA/Rac 1 balance. These results indicate that the lectin-like domain of TNF has a potential therapeutic value in protecting from LLO-induced pulmonary endothelial hyperpermeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Jinling</author><author>Duh, Elia J</author><author>Caldwell, Ruth B</author><author>Behzadian, M Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antipermeability function of PEDF involves blockade of the MAP kinase/GSK/beta-catenin signaling pathway and uPAR expression.</title><secondary-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science</full-title></periodical><pages>3273-3280</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Dextrans</keyword><keyword>Dextrans: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins</keyword><keyword>Eye Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: analogs &amp; derivative</keyword><keyword>Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3: antagonists &amp; inhibito</keyword><keyword>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: antagonists &amp; i</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nerve Growth Factors</keyword><keyword>Nerve Growth Factors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels</keyword><keyword>Retinal Vessels: cytology</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Serpins</keyword><keyword>Serpins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Urokinase Plasminogen Activator</keyword><keyword>Urokinase Plasminogen Activator: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20089873</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1167/iovs.08-2878</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2891479&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial permeability.

Besides the remarkable progress in molecular genomics- or proteomics-based diagnostics, there is a great demand for in vitro biosensor devices that allow rapid and selective detection of the invasive properties of tumor cells. Here, the classical cancer cell motility in vitro assays for migration and invasion relying on Boyden chambers are compared to a real-time biosensor that analyzes the dynamic properties of adherent cells electro-acoustically with a time resolution on the order of seconds. The sensor relies on the well-established quartz crystal microbalance technique (QCM) that measures the shift in resonance frequency and damping of an oscillating quartz crystal when adsorption, desorption or changes in material properties close to the quartz surface occur. In addition, the QCM is capable of detecting the rather subtle fluctuations of the cell bodies as an indicator for their micromotility. QCM-based micromotility readings of three different cancer cell lines (HT-29, HSC-4, FaDu) are compared with the well-known electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) revealing collective stochastic motion that corresponds to the malignancy of the cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Hang Thi Thu</author><author>Dalmasso, Guillaume</author><author>Yan, Yutao</author><author>Laroui, Hamed</author><author>Dahan, Stephanie</author><author>Mayer, Lloyd</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi V</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNA-7 modulates CD98 expression during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1479-1489</pages><volume>285</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>3' Untranslated Regions</keyword><keyword>3' Untranslated Regions: genetics</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD98</keyword><keyword>CD98: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>CD98: genetics</keyword><keyword>Caco-2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Polarity</keyword><keyword>Cell Polarity: genetics</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease: genetics</keyword><keyword>Crohn Disease: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: genetics</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: genetics</keyword><keyword>Inflammation: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1beta</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1beta: genetics</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1beta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Jejunum</keyword><keyword>Jejunum: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Laminin</keyword><keyword>Laminin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Laminin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: genetics</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19892711</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M109.057141</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (MicroRNA-7 modulates CD98 expression during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. - Nguyen, Hang Thi Thu; Dalmasso, Guillaume; Yan, Yutao; Laroui, Hamed; Dahan, Stephanie; Mayer, Lloyd; Sitaraman, Shanthi V; Merlin, Didier)

MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, thereby functioning as modulators of numerous cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we investigated if microRNAs regulate CD98 expression during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and inflammation. We found that microRNA-7 repressed CD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of human CD98 mRNA. Expression of CD98 was decreased, whereas that of microRNA-7 was increased in well-differentiated Caco2-BBE cells compared with undifferentiated cells. Undifferentiated crypt cells isolated from mouse jejunum showed higher CD98 levels and lower levels of mmu-microRNA-706, a murine original microRNA candidate for CD98, than well-differentiated villus cells. Importantly, microRNA-7 decreased Caco2-BBE cell attachment on laminin-1, and CD98 overexpression recovered this inhibition, suggesting that microRNA-7 modulates epithelial cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, which in turn could affect proliferation and differentiation during the migration of enterocytes across the crypt-villus axis, by regulating CD98 expression. In a pathological context, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-beta increased CD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells by decreasing microRNA-7 levels. Consistent with the in vitro findings, microRNA-7 levels were decreased in actively inflamed Crohn disease colonic tissues, where CD98 expression was up-regulated, compared with normal tissues. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism underlying regulation of CD98 expression during patho-physiological states. This study raises microRNAs as a promising target for therapeutic modulations of CD98 expression in intestinal inflammatory disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davies, Simon</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ALCAM , Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule Influences the Aggressive Nature of Breast Cancer Cells , a Potential Connection to Bone Metastasis</title><secondary-title>Anticancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anticancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>3-9</pages><volume>30</volume><keywords><keyword>alcam</keyword><keyword>bone metastasis</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>cd166</keyword><keyword>cell</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><notes>From Duplicate 1 (I Epidemiological ALCAM , Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule Influences the Aggressive Nature of Breast Cancer Cells , a Potential Connection to Bone Metastasis - Davies, Simon; Jiang, Wen G)

We have recently described ANP-protective effects against thrombin-induced barrier dysfunction in pulmonary endothelial cells (EC). The current study examined involvement of the Rac effector p21-activated kinase (PAK1) in ANP-protective effects in the model of lung vascular permeability induced by bacterial wall LPS. C57BL/6J mice or ANP knockout mice (Nppa(-/-)) were treated with LPS (0.63 mg/kg intratracheal) with or without ANP (2 μg/kg iv). Lung injury was monitored by measurements of bronchoalveolar lavage protein content, cell count, Evans blue extravasation, and lung histology. Endothelial barrier properties were assessed by morphological analysis and measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance. ANP treatment stimulated Rac-dependent PAK1 phosphorylation, attenuated endothelial permeability caused by LPS, TNF-α, and IL-6, decreased LPS-induced cell and protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and suppressed Evans blue extravasation in the murine model of acute lung injury. More severe LPS-induced lung injury and vascular leak were observed in ANP knockout mice. In rescue experiments, ANP injection significantly reduced lung injury in Nppa(-/-) mice caused by LPS. Molecular inhibition of PAK1 suppressed the protective effects of ANP treatment against LPS-induced lung injury and endothelial barrier dysfunction. This study shows that the protective effects of ANP against LPS-induced vascular leak are mediated at least in part by PAK1-dependent signaling leading to EC barrier enhancement. Our data suggest a direct role for ANP in endothelial barrier regulation via modulation of small GTPase signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schlegel, Nicolas</author><author>Meir, Michael</author><author>Heupel, Wolfgang-Moritz</author><author>Holthöfer, Bastian</author><author>Leube, Rudolf E</author><author>Waschke, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Desmoglein 2-mediated adhesion is required for intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Whereas specific roles of tight and adherens junctions are well known, the contribution of desmosomal adhesion for maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier has not been specifically addressed. For the present study, we generated a desmoglein 2 antibody directed against the extracellular domain (Dsg2 ED) to test whether impaired Dsg2-mediated adhesion affects intestinal epithelial barrier functions in vitro. This antibody was able to specifically block Dsg2 interaction in cell-free atomic-force microscopy experiments. For in vitro studies of the intestinal barrier we used Caco2 cells following differentiation into tight enterocyte-like epithelial monolayers. Application of Dsg2 ED to Caco2 monolayers resulted in increased cell dissociation compared with controls in a dispase-based enterocyte dissociation assay. Under similar conditions, Dsg2 antibody significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased FITC-dextran flux, indicating that Dsg2 interaction is critically involved in the maintenance of epithelial intestinal barrier functions. As revealed by immunostaining, this was due to Dsg2 ED antibody-induced rupture of tight junctions because tight junction proteins claudins 1, 4, and 5, occludin, and tight junction-associated protein zonula occludens-1 were partially removed from cell borders by Dsg2 ED treatment. Similar results were obtained by application of a commercial monoclonal antibody directed against the ED of Dsg2. Antibody-induced effects were blocked by absorption experiments using Dsg2-Fc-coated beads. Our data indicate that Dsg2-mediated adhesion affects tight junction integrity and is required to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier properties.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heijink, I H</author><author>Brandenburg, S M</author><author>Noordhoek, J a</author><author>Postma, D S</author><author>Slebos, D-J</author><author>van Oosterhout, a J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterisation of cell adhesion in airway epithelial cell types using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</title><secondary-title>The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>894-903</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Mucosa: cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19741028</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1183/09031936.00065809</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Characterisation of cell adhesion in airway epithelial cell types using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. - Heijink, I H; Brandenburg, S M; Noordhoek, J a; Postma, D S; Slebos, D-J; van Oosterhout, a J M)

The novel electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technique was used to monitor cell adhesion/spreading, barrier function and wound healing. Primary bronchial epithelium was compared with airway epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o-, BEAS-2B, NCI-H292 and A549. BEAS-2B, A549 and primary cells form a confluent monolayer more rapidly than do 16HBE14o- cells. In contrast, 16HBE14o- cells form stronger intercellular contacts, with a 10-fold higher resistance than BEAS-2B, A549 and NCI-H292 cells and a five-fold increase over primary cells. Accordingly, expression of the adhesion molecules zona occludens-1 and E-cadherin was highest in 16HBE14o- cells. These molecules were localised in intercellular junctions in both 16HBE14o- and primary cells. Finally, restoration of barrier function upon injury was impaired in BEAS-2B compared to 16HBE14o- cells. In conclusion, epithelial cell types display remarkable phenotypic differences and should, accordingly, be used to address specific research questions. 16HBE14o- cells appear most suitable for studies on barrier formation, whereas resemblance in attachment of primary and BEAS-2B and A549 cells makes the latter more important for translational research on cell-matrix contact.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Duijn, Trynette J</author><author>Anthony, Eloise C</author><author>Hensbergen, Paul J</author><author>Deelder, André M</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rac1 recruits the adapter protein CMS/CD2AP to cell-cell contacts.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>20137-20146</pages><volume>285</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites: genetics</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>CapZ Actin Capping Protein</keyword><keyword>CapZ Actin Capping Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>CapZ Actin Capping Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cortactin</keyword><keyword>Cortactin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cortactin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Interaction Mapping</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transducing</keyword><keyword>Signal Transducing: genetics</keyword><keyword>Signal Transducing: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: genetics</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src Homology Domains</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20404345</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M109.099481</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2888426&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which regulate cell adhesion and migration through their control of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho-GTPases are structurally very similar, with the exception of a hypervariable domain in the C terminus. Using peptide-based pulldown assays in combination with mass spectrometry, we previously showed that the hypervariable domain in Rac1 mediates specific protein-protein interactions. Most recently, we found that the Rac1 C terminus associates to the ubiquitously expressed adapter protein CMS/CD2AP. CD2AP is critical for the formation and maintenance of a specialized cell-cell contact between kidney podocyte foot processes, the slit diaphragm. Here, CD2AP links the cell adhesion protein nephrin to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, CMS/CD2AP binds actin-regulating proteins, such as CAPZ and cortactin, and has been implicated in the internalization of growth factor receptors. We found that CD2AP specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of Rac1 but not with that of other Rho family members. Efficient interaction between Rac1 and CD2AP requires both the proline-rich domain and the poly-basic region in the Rac1 C terminus, and at least two of the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP. CD2AP co-localizes with Rac1 to membrane ruffles, and small interfering RNA-based experiments showed that CD2AP links Rac1 to CAPZ and cortactin. Finally, expression of constitutive active Rac1 recruits CD2AP to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells, where we found CD2AP to participate in the control of the epithelial barrier function. These data identify CD2AP as a novel Rac1-associated adapter protein that participates in the regulation of epithelial cell-cell contact.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Qing</author><author>Harrington, Elizabeth O</author><author>Newton, Julie</author><author>Casserly, Brian</author><author>Radin, Gregory</author><author>Warburton, Rod</author><author>Zhou, Yang</author><author>Blackburn, Michael R</author><author>Rounds, Sharon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adenosine protected against pulmonary edema through transporter- and receptor A2-mediated endothelial barrier enhancement.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

In the current study, we tested the effect of elevated adenosine on pulmonary endothelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. We noted that adenosine alone dose dependently enhanced endothelial barrier function. While adenosine receptor A(1) or A(3) antagonists were ineffective, an adenosine transporter inhibitor, NBTI, or a combination of DPMX and MRS1754, antagonists for adenosine receptors A(2A) and A(2B), respectively, partially attenuated the barrier-enhancing effect of adenosine. Similarly, inhibition of both A(2A) and A(2B) receptors with siRNA also blunted the effect of adenosine on barrier function. Interestingly, inhibition of both transporters and A(2A)/A(2B) receptors completely abolished adenosine-induced endothelial barrier enhancement. The adenosine receptor A(2A) and A(2B) agonist, NECA, also significantly enhanced endothelial barrier function. These data suggest that both adenosine transporters and A(2A) and A(2B) receptors are necessary for exerting maximal effect of adenosine on barrier enhancement. We also found that adenosine enhanced Rac1 GTPase activity and overexpression of dominant negative Rac1 attenuated adenosine-induced increases in focal adhesion complexes. We further demonstrated that elevation of cellular adenosine by inhibition of adenosine deaminase with Pentostatin significantly enhanced endothelial basal barrier function, an effect that was also associated with enhanced Rac1 GTPase activity and with increased focal adhesion complexes and adherens junctions. Finally, using a non-inflammatory acute lung injury (ALI) model induced by alpha-naphthylthiourea, we found that administration of Pentostatin, which elevated lung adenosine level by 10-fold, not only attenuated the development of edema before ALI but also partially reversed edema after ALI. The data suggest that adenosine deaminase inhibition may be useful in treatment of pulmonary edema in settings of ALI.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yun, YeoHeung</author><author>Dong, Zhongyun</author><author>Tan, Zongqing</author><author>Schulz, Mark J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of an electrode cell impedance method to measure osteoblast cell activity in magnesium-conditioned media.</title><secondary-title>Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>3009-3015</pages><volume>396</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Conditioned</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemical Techniques</keyword><keyword>Electrochemical Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnesium</keyword><keyword>Magnesium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20213174</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00216-010-3521-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20213174</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Magnesium (Mg) as a biodegradable metal has potential advantages as an implant material. This paper studies the effect of magnesium ions on osteoblast (U2-OS) behavior since magnesium implants mainly dissolve as divalent magnesium ions (Mg(2+)). A real-time monitoring technique based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used for measuring cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and cytotoxicity in magnesium-conditioned media. The impedance results show that U2-OS proliferation and adhesion were inhibited in not only a magnesium-free medium but also in a medium with a high concentration of magnesium. The impedance method produced more sensitive results than the output of an MTT assay. Other standard bioanalytical tests were conducted for comparison with the ECIS method. Immunochemistry was carried out to study cell adhesion in magnesium-conditioned media by staining using F-actin and alpha-tubulin and correlated cell density on the electrode with impedance. Bone tissue formation was studied using von Kossa staining and indicated the mineralization level of cells in magnesium-conditioned media decreased with the increase of magnesium ion concentration. Real-time PCR provided gene expression indicators of cell growth, apoptosis, inflammation, and migration. Compared to the bioanalytical methods of immunochemistry and MTT assays, which need preparation time and post-washing step, ECIS was able to measure cell activity in real time without any cell culture modification. In summary, ECIS might be an effective way to study biodegradable magnesium implants.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kandasamy, Karthikeyan</author><author>Choi, Cheol Soo</author><author>Kim, Sanghyo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficient analysis of nanomaterial cytotoxicity based on bioimpedance.</title><secondary-title>Nanotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>375501</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>37</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biophysics</keyword><keyword>Biophysics: methods</keyword><keyword>Carbon</keyword><keyword>Carbon: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Carbon: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cercopithecus aethiops</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxins</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxins: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Gold: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: adverse effects</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Nanotubes</keyword><keyword>Vero Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20714049</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/0957-4484/21/37/375501</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20714049</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the emerging nanotechnology field, there is an urgent need for the development of a significant and sensitive method that can be used to analyse and compare the cytotoxicities of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), since such materials can be applied as contrast agents or drug delivery carriers. The bioimpedance system possesses great potential in many medical research fields including nanotechnology. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a particular bioimpedance system that offers a real-time, non-invasive, and quantitative measurement method for the cytotoxicity of various materials. The present work compared the cytotoxicity of AuNPs to that of purchased single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The size-controlled and monodispersed AuNPs were synthesized under autoclaved conditions and reduced by ascorbic acid (AA) whereas the purchased SWCNTs were used without any surface modifications. Bioimpedance results were validated by conventional WST-1 and trypan blue assays, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were performed to examine nanomaterials inside the VERO cells. This research evaluates the ability of the ECIS system compared to those of conventional methods in analyzing the cytotoxicity of AuNPs and SWCNTs with higher sensitivity under real-time conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Lei</author><author>Yin, Hongying</author><author>Xing, Wanli</author><author>Yu, Zhongyao</author><author>Guo, Min</author><author>Cheng, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time, label-free monitoring of the cell cycle with a cellular impedance sensing chip.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>990-995</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle: physiology</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19818595</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2009.09.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818595</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The cell cycle plays a crucial role in many cellular physiological processes and has drawn an increasing interest in past decades. In the current study, we have developed a bioelectronic chip-based system capable of performing real-time dynamic analysis of the cell cycle in live cells via non-invasive cellular impedance sensing. The cells were cultured on the cellular impedance sensing chip comprising microfabricated interdigitated electrode structures. HeLa cells were synchronized with double thymidine block and the cellular impedances were monitored in a time resolution of minutes during the whole 5 days' experiment. Our results show that real-time impedance sensing can clearly mirror the progression of the cell cycle-in G(1) phase and S phase, the cellular impedance increased with time, while in G(2) phase and M phase, the cellular impedance decreased. Correspondingly, the time-course impedance curves for the synchronized cells have marked &quot;M-valleys&quot; corresponding to the periods of mitosis of the cells. The cell cycle information revealed by the cellular impedance data was confirmed using flow cytometry and microscopy. This paper presents the first step towards in situ and label-free monitoring of the cell cycle of mammalian cells on chip in a real-time, non-invasive manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author><author>Kunze, Angelika</author><author>Michaelis, Stefanie</author><author>Heitmann, V</author><author>Reiss, B</author><author>Wegener, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell Adhesion Monitoring Using Substrate-Integrated Sensors</title><secondary-title>Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>2079-2104</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>13-14</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Adsorption</keyword><keyword>Biomedical engineering</keyword><keyword>Cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)</keyword><keyword>Electric cells</keyword><keyword>Liposomes</keyword><keyword>Mammals</keyword><keyword>Phospholipids</keyword><keyword>Piezoelectric devices</keyword><keyword>Quartz</keyword><keyword>Quartz crystal microbalances</keyword><keyword>Substrates</keyword><keyword>adhesion of animal cells</keyword><keyword>cell</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>cell spreading</keyword><keyword>cell-matrix interactions</keyword><keyword>cell-surface junction</keyword><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>electric cell</keyword><keyword>liposome adsorption</keyword><keyword>qcm</keyword><keyword>quartz crystal microbalance</keyword><keyword>quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)</keyword><keyword>spreading</keyword><keyword>substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>surface junction</keyword><keyword>to in vitro surfaces</keyword><keyword>why bother</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0169-4243</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1163/016942410X507939</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Cell Adhesion Monitoring Using Substrate-Integrated Sensors - Janshoff, Andreas; Kunze, Angelika; Michaelis, Stefanie)

One important issue in the context of cell-surface adhesion is the time course of attachment and spreading upon surfaces that are decorated with proteins to make them cytocompatible. This article reviews two emerging non-microscopic techniques capable of monitoring the adhesion process label-free and in real-time. Both approaches, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), are based on substrate-integrated transducers that transduce cellular adhesion into an electrical signal. A short introduction of both techniques is followed by a set of examples that illustrate the performance of these sensors, their individual merits and limitations. In order to analyze the integral and complex signals of both sensors in contact with mammalian cells in more detail, we also studied their individual readouts during the adsorption of liposomes with well-defined structure and chemical composition.

We observed that addition of BMPCs to endothelial monolayers at a fixed ratio prevented the thrombin-induced decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance, a measure of AJ integrity, and increased mouse pulmonary microvessel filtration coefficient, a measure of transvascular liquid permeability. The barrier protection was coupled to increased vascular endothelial cadherin expression and increased Cdc42 activity in ECs. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to deplete Cdc42 in ECs, we demonstrated a key role of Cdc42 in signaling the BMPC-induced endothelial barrier protection. Endothelial integrity induced by BMPCs was also secondary to inhibition of MLC phosphorylation in ECs. Thus BMPCs interacting with ECs prevent thrombin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability by a mechanism involving AJ barrier annealing, inhibition of MLC phosphorylation, and activation of Cdc42.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Renken, Christian</author><author>Keese, Charles</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated assays for quantifying cell migration</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>844</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2144/000113554</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biotechniques.com/article/000113554</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Xiangjian</author><author>Xu, Chong</author><author>Di Lorenzo, Annarita</author><author>Kleaveland, Benjamin</author><author>Zou, Zhiying</author><author>Seiler, Christoph</author><author>Chen, Mei</author><author>Cheng, Lan</author><author>Xiao, Jiping</author><author>He, Jie</author><author>Pack, Michael A</author><author>Sessa, William C</author><author>Kahn, Mark L</author><author>Lorenzo, Annarita Di</author><author>Kleaveland, Benjamin</author><author>Zou, Zhiying</author><author>Seiler, Christoph</author><author>Chen, Mei</author><author>Cheng, Lan</author><author>Xiao, Jiping</author><author>He, Jie</author><author>Pack, Michael A</author><author>Sessa, William C</author><author>Kahn, Mark L</author><author>Di Lorenzo, Annarita</author><author>Kleaveland, Benjamin</author><author>Zou, Zhiying</author><author>Seiler, Christoph</author><author>Chen, Mei</author><author>Cheng, Lan</author><author>Xiao, Jiping</author><author>He, Jie</author><author>Pack, Michael A</author><author>Sessa, William C</author><author>Kahn, Mark L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CCM3 signaling through sterile 20 – like kinases plays an essential role during zebrafish cardiovascular development and cerebral cavernous malformations</title><secondary-title>Zebrafish</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zebrafish</full-title></periodical><pages>2795-2804</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular System</keyword><keyword>Cardiovascular System: embryology</keyword><keyword>Cavernous</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System: etiology</keyword><keyword>Conserved Sequence</keyword><keyword>Hemangioma</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins: phy</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microtubule-Associated Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microtubule-Associated Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Zebrafish</keyword><keyword>Zebrafish Proteins</keyword><keyword>Zebrafish Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Zebrafish Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Zebrafish Proteins: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20592472</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/JCI39679</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (CCM3 signaling through sterile 20 – like kinases plays an essential role during zebrafish cardiovascular development and cerebral cavernous malformations - Zheng, Xiangjian;

CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 interact biochemically in a pathway required in endothelial cells during cardiovascular development in mice and zebrafish. The downstream effectors by which this signaling pathway regulates endothelial function have not yet been identified. Here we have shown in zebrafish that expression of mutant ccm3 proteins (ccm3Delta) known to cause cerebral cavernous malformation in humans confers cardiovascular phenotypes identical to those associated with loss of ccm1 and ccm2. CCM3Delta proteins interacted with CCM1 and CCM2, but not with other proteins known to bind wild-type CCM3, serine/threonine protein kinase MST4 (MST4), sterile 20-like serine/threonine kinase 24 (STK24), and STK25, all of which have poorly defined biological functions. Cardiovascular phenotypes characteristic of CCM deficiency arose due to stk deficiency and combined low-level deficiency of stks and ccm3 in zebrafish embryos. In cultured human endothelial cells, CCM3 and STK25 regulated barrier function in a manner similar to CCM2, and STKs negatively regulated Rho by directly activating moesin. These studies identify STKs as essential downstream effectors of CCM signaling in development and disease that may regulate both endothelial and epithelial cell junctions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>Luong, John H T</author><author>Xiaoa, Caide</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A simple mathematical model for electric cell-substrate impedance sensing with extended applications.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>1774-1780</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics resistance</keyword><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Physiological Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Physiological Phenomena: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Physiological Phenomena: radiation effec</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Computer-Aided Design</keyword><keyword>Conductometry</keyword><keyword>Conductometry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Conductometry: methods</keyword><keyword>Doubling time</keyword><keyword>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>Electromagnetic Fields</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Ferri/ferrocyanide</keyword><keyword>Impedance</keyword><keyword>Impedance: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>L-Cysteine</keyword><keyword>Mathematical model</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Plethysmography</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>20096558</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2009.12.025</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (A simple mathematical model for electric cell-substrate impedance sensing with extended applications - Xiaoa, Caide; Luong, John H T)

With this model, the equivalent resistance (R) and capacitance (C) of biological samples adhered on gold surfaces could be more precisely measured at 4 kHz. ECIS applications were extended for real-time monitoring of living bacteria cultivated in Luria Bertani (LB) culture medium by two different approaches. In the former, we used a ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple in LB medium as an indicator for bacterial multiplication. Because the redox couple was toxic to some bacteria, we developed a second approach, in which l-cysteine self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on gold electrodes were used to detect living bacteria. The l-cysteine SAM could also be detected by ECIS. Unlike traditional impedance microbiological methods which need special culture media with low ions, our procedures significantly enhanced signal/noise ratios so bacteria could be detected in general purpose culture media. It was easy and convenient to obtain bacterial doubling times and evaluate the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics from ECIS spectra.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adam, Alejandro P</author><author>Sharenko, Amy L</author><author>Pumiglia, Kevin</author><author>Vincent, Peter A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is not sufficient to decrease barrier function of endothelial monolayers.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>7045-7055</pages><volume>285</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenoviridae</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae: genetics</keyword><keyword>Adenoviridae: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: genetics</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tyrosine</keyword><keyword>Tyrosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>p120 GTPase Activating Protein</keyword><keyword>p120 GTPase Activating Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20048167</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M109.079277</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2844154&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Activation of Src family kinases (SFK) and the subsequent phosphorylation of VE-cadherin have been proposed as major regulatory steps leading to increases in vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators and growth factors. To investigate Src signaling in the absence of parallel signaling pathways initiated by growth factors or inflammatory mediators, we activated Src and SFKs by expression of dominant negative Csk, expression of constitutively active Src, or knockdown of Csk. Activation of SFK by overexpression of dominant negative Csk induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at tyrosines 658, 685, and 731. However, dominant negative Csk expression was unable to induce changes in the monolayer permeability. In contrast, expression of constitutively active Src decreased barrier function and promoted VE-cadherin phosphorylation on tyrosines 658 and 731, although the increase in VE-cadherin phosphorylation preceded the increase in permeability by 4-6 h. Csk knockdown induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at sites 658 and 731 but did not induce a loss in barrier function. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies suggest that phosphorylation of those sites did not impair VE-cadherin ability to bind p120 and beta-catenin or the ability of these proteins to localize at the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data show that Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is not sufficient to promote an increase in endothelial cell monolayer permeability and suggest that signaling leading to changes in vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators or growth factors may require VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation concurrently with other signaling pathways to promote loss of barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scott, Clay W</author><author>Peters, Matthew F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Label-free whole-cell assays: expanding the scope of GPCR screening.</title><secondary-title>Drug discovery today</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug discovery today</full-title></periodical><pages>704-716</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>17-18</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Drug Discovery</keyword><keyword>Drug Discovery: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Drug Discovery: methods</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20601093</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.drudis.2010.06.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601093</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A new class of instruments offers an unprecedented combination of label-free detection with exquisite sensitivity to live-cell responses. These instruments can quantify G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling through G(s), G(i) and G(q) pathways and in some cases distinguish G-protein coupling, with sensitivity high enough to detect endogenous receptors. Here, we review emerging data evaluating impedance- and optical-based label-free instruments for GPCR drug discovery. In comparison with traditional GPCR assays, we highlight strengths, weaknesses and future opportunities for label-free biosensors. The ability to qualitatively distinguish G-protein coupling has groundbreaking potential for assessing functional selectivity, a concept that is changing the way GPCR pharmacology is defined and screening strategies are designed.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Catravas, John D</author><author>Snead, Connie</author><author>Dimitropoulou, Christiana</author><author>Chang, Albert S Y</author><author>Lucas, Rudolf</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Black, Stephen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Harvesting, identification and barrier function of human lung microvascular endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Vascular pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vascular pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>175-181</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>5-6</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Lung Injury</keyword><keyword>Acute Lung Injury: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Adult: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Microvessels</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Distress Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand Factor</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand Factor: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>20060932</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.vph.2009.12.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Harvesting, identification and barrier function of human lung microvascular endothelial cells. - Catravas, John D; Snead, Connie; Dimitropoulou, Christiana; Chang, Albert S Y; Lucas, Rudolf; Verin, Alexander D; Black, Stephen M)

Even though approaches that target the prevention and repair of endothelial barrier dysfunction are clearly needed, our understanding of the molecular regulation of pulmonary microvascular endothelial permeability remains incomplete. Cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells represent an attractive paradigm for the study of barrier function. Here, we describe a method for the harvest, identification and culture of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). HLMVEC thus obtained, grow as a monolayer, exhibit contact inhibition and have the typical cobblestone appearance. They express endothelial proteins, such as von Willebrand factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and take up an acetylated LDL. Furthermore, HLMVEC respond predictably and with superior sensitivity to the barrier disruptive effects of Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial products, thrombin, vascular endothelial growth factor and microtubule disrupting agents. These HLMVEC present an in-house-derived alternative to commercially available human cells for the study of mechanisms contributing to ALI and ARDS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernas, Michael J</author><author>Cardoso, Filipa L</author><author>Daley, Sarah K</author><author>Weinand, Martin E</author><author>Campos, Alexandre R</author><author>Ferreira, António J Gonçalves</author><author>Hoying, James B</author><author>Witte, Marlys H</author><author>Brites, Dora</author><author>Persidsky, Yuri</author><author>Ramirez, Servio H</author><author>Brito, Maria a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Establishment of primary cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial cells to provide an in vitro cellular model of the blood-brain barrier.</title><secondary-title>Nature protocols</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature protocols</full-title></periodical><pages>1265-1272</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: cytology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type I</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Glucose Transporter Type 1</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus</keyword><keyword>Hippocampus: cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoprotein</keyword><keyword>Pericytes</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe</keyword><keyword>Temporal Lobe: cytology</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>von Willebrand Factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>20595955</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nprot.2010.76</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Establishment of primary cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial cells to provide an in vitro cellular model of the blood-brain barrier. - Bernas, Michael J; Cardoso, Filipa L; Daley, Sarah K; Weinand, Martin E; Campos, Alexandre R; Ferreira, António J Gonçalves; Hoying, James B; Witte, Marlys H; Brites, Dora; Persidsky, Yuri; Ramirez, Servio H; Brito, Maria a)

HBMVECs are derived from microvessels isolated from temporal tissue removed during operative treatment of epilepsy. The tissue is mechanically fragmented and size filtered using polyester meshes. The resulting microvessel fragments are placed onto type I collagen-coated flasks to allow HBMVECs to migrate and proliferate. The overall process takes less than 3 h and does not require specialized equipment or enzymatic processes. HBMVECs are typically cultured for approximately 1 month until confluent. Cultures are highly pure ( approximately 97% endothelial cells; approximately 3% pericytes), are reproducible, and show characteristic brain endothelial markers (von Willebrand factor, glucose transporter-1) and robust expression of tight and adherens junction proteins as well as caveolin-1 and efflux protein P-glycoprotein. Monolayers of HBMVECs show characteristically high transendothelial electric resistance and have proven useful in multiple functional studies for in vitro modeling of the human blood-brain barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nethe, Micha</author><author>Anthony, Eloise C</author><author>Fernandez-Borja, Mar</author><author>Dee, Rob</author><author>Geerts, Dirk</author><author>Hensbergen, Paul J</author><author>Deelder, André M</author><author>Schmidt, Gudula</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Focal-adhesion targeting links caveolin-1 to a Rac1-degradation pathway.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>1948-1958</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>Pt 11</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1: genetics</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface Extensions</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface Extensions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface Extensions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Feedback</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: pathology</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hela Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Physiological</keyword><keyword>Pyrones</keyword><keyword>Pyrones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Quinolines</keyword><keyword>Quinolines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20460433</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/jcs.062919</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460433</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Directional cell migration is crucially dependent on the spatiotemporal control of intracellular signalling events. These events regulate polarized actin dynamics, resulting in protrusion at the front of the cell and contraction at the rear. The actin cytoskeleton is regulated through signalling by Rho-like GTPases, such as RhoA, which stimulates myosin-based contractility, and CDC42 and Rac1, which promote actin polymerization and protrusion. Here, we show that Rac1 binds the adapter protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) and that Rac1 activity promotes Cav1 accumulation at Rac1-positive peripheral adhesions. Using Cav1-deficient mouse fibroblasts and depletion of Cav1 expression in human epithelial and endothelial cells mediated by small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA, we show that loss of Cav1 induces an increase in Rac1 protein and its activated, GTP-bound form. Cav1 controls Rac1 protein levels by regulating ubiquitylation and degradation of activated Rac1 in an adhesion-dependent fashion. Finally, we show that Rac1 ubiquitylation is not required for effector binding, but regulates the dynamics of Rac1 at the periphery of the cell. These data extend the canonical model of Rac1 inactivation and uncover Cav1-regulated polyubiquitylation as an additional mechanism to control Rac1 signalling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dalmasso, Guillaume</author><author>Nguyen, Hang Thi Thu</author><author>Yan, Yutao</author><author>Laroui, Hamed</author><author>Srinivasan, Shanthi</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi V</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNAs determine human intestinal epithelial cell fate.</title><secondary-title>Differentiation; research in biological diversity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Differentiation; research in biological diversity</full-title></periodical><pages>147-154</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Lineage</keyword><keyword>Cell Lineage: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: cytology</keyword><keyword>Intestines</keyword><keyword>Intestines: cytology</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs: physiology</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20638171</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.diff.2010.06.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2943016&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Evidence has shown that miRNAs play important roles in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. The intestinal epithelium is regenerated throughout life, and enterocytes undergo differentiation during migration along the crypt/villus axis. Our study aimed at establishing the expression profiles of miRNAs during intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) differentiation and determining a miRNA &quot;signature&quot; that distinguishes between small and large IECs. MiRNA arrays were employed to profile miRNA expression in two IEC models: the enterocyte-like Caco2-BBE and the colonocyte-like HT29-Cl.19A cell lines. Microarray data showed that in both cell lineages, the differentiated stage exhibited a different miRNA expression profile from undifferentiated stage. Interestingly, Caco2-BBE cells were distinguished from HT29-Cl.19A cells by their unique miRNA expression profile. Notably, HT29-Cl.19A cells exhibited down-regulation of miR-1269 and up-regulation of miR-99b and miR-125a-5p compared with Caco2-BBE cells. Most importantly, transfection of Caco2-BBE cells with mature miR-99b, mature miR-125a-5p and antisense of mature miR-1269 decreased growth rate and trans-epithelial resistance of the cells, indicating their shift toward HT29-Cl.19A cell phenotype. In conclusion, our study shows that miRNAs might play a role in determining the unique physiological characteristics of IECs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsapara, Anna</author><author>Luthert, Phillip</author><author>Greenwood, John</author><author>Hill, Caroline S</author><author>Matter, Karl</author><author>Balda, Maria S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The RhoA Activator GEF-H1 / Lfc Is a Transforming Growth Factor- ␤ Target Gene and Effector That Regulates ␣ -Smooth Muscle Actin Expression and Cell Migration</title><secondary-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>860-870</pages><volume>21</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1091/mbc.E09</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECIS Migration</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez-Fraticelli, Alejo E</author><author>Vergarajauregui, Silvia</author><author>Eastburn, Dennis J</author><author>Datta, Anirban</author><author>Alonso, Miguel a</author><author>Mostov, Keith</author><author>Martín-Belmonte, Fernando</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cdc42 GEF Intersectin 2 controls mitotic spindle orientation to form the lumen during epithelial morphogenesis.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>725-738</pages><volume>189</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitotic Spindle Apparatus</keyword><keyword>Mitotic Spindle Apparatus: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitotic Spindle Apparatus: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Morphogenesis</keyword><keyword>Morphogenesis: physiology</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Tubulin</keyword><keyword>Tubulin: analysis</keyword><keyword>Vesicular Transport</keyword><keyword>Vesicular Transport: metabolism</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20479469</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.201002047</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2872911&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Epithelial organs are made of tubes and cavities lined by a monolayer of polarized cells that enclose the central lumen. Lumen formation is a crucial step in the formation of epithelial organs. The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc42, which is a master regulator of cell polarity, regulates the formation of the central lumen in epithelial morphogenesis. However, how Cdc42 is regulated during this process is still poorly understood. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) control the activation of small GTPases. Using the three-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney model, we have identified a Cdc42-specific GEF, Intersectin 2 (ITSN2), which localizes to the centrosomes and regulates Cdc42 activation during epithelial morphogenesis. Silencing of either Cdc42 or ITSN2 disrupts the correct orientation of the mitotic spindle and normal lumen formation, suggesting a direct relationship between these processes. Furthermore, we demonstrated this direct relationship using LGN, a component of the machinery for mitotic spindle positioning, whose disruption also results in lumen formation defects.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cain, Robert J</author><author>Vanhaesebroeck, Bart</author><author>Ridley, Anne J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The PI3K p110alpha isoform regulates endothelial adherens junctions via Pyk2 and Rac1.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>863-876</pages><volume>188</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherens Junctions</keyword><keyword>Adherens Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 2</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20308428</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1083/jcb.200907135</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (The PI3K p110alpha isoform regulates endothelial adherens junctions via Pyk2 and Rac1. - Cain, Robert J; Vanhaesebroeck, Bart; Ridley, Anne J)

Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) increase endothelial barrier function, but the roles of different PI3K isoforms have not been addressed. In this study, we determine the contribution of each of the four class I PI3K isoforms (p110alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta) to endothelial permeability and leukocyte TEM. We find that depletion of p110alpha but not other p110 isoforms decreases TNF-induced endothelial permeability, Tyr phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), and leukocyte TEM. p110alpha selectively mediates activation of the Tyr kinase Pyk2 and GTPase Rac1 to regulate barrier function. Additionally, p110alpha mediates the association of VE-cadherin with Pyk2, the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam-1 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. We propose that p110alpha regulates endothelial barrier function by inducing the formation of a VE-cadherin-associated protein complex that coordinates changes to adherens junctions with the actin cytoskeleton.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Chongxiu</author><author>Wu, Mack H</author><author>Guo, Mingzhang</author><author>Day, Mark L</author><author>Lee, Eugene S</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAM15 regulates endothelial permeability and neutrophil migration via Src/ERK1/2 signalling.</title><secondary-title>Cardiovascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cardiovascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>348-355</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Albumins</keyword><keyword>Albumins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte Rolling</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte Rolling: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1: antagonists &amp;</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3: antagonists &amp;</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>src-Family Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20189953</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cvr/cvq060</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2895539&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Endothelial barrier dysfunction is a key event in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases associated with inflammation.

We aimed to discern the involvement of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in allergen-induced epithelial barrier impairment, as we previously observed that house dust mite (HDM) signals through EGFR. We investigated the junctional integrity of human bronchial epithelial cells using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing and immunofluorescent staining. HDM induced a rapid, transient fall in epithelial resistance, concomitant with delocalisation of E-cadherin and zona occludens (ZO)-1, and proteolytic cleavage of the latter. EGFR inhibition by AG1478 reduced the HDM-triggered decrease in epithelial resistance and improved restoration of epithelial junctions. Similarly, AG1478 increased epithelial barrier recovery upon electroporation-induced injury, although it delayed the migration phase of the wound healing response. HDM-promoted redistribution of E-cadherin was mediated via EGFR-dependent activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2, while the concomitant ZO-1 degradation was PAR-2/EGFR-independent. Importantly, the fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β prolonged HDM-induced EGFR phosphorylation and inhibited ligand-induced EGFR internalisation/degradation, which resulted in sustained E-cadherin and ZO-1 redistribution. Thus, allergen-induced, PAR-2/EGFR-mediated signalling decreases epithelial resistance and promotes junction disassembly. The TGF-β-enhanced EGFR signalling may be an important contributor to barrier dysfunction and increased epithelial vulnerability in response to HDM.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cai, Wei</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Sun, Jiabang</author><author>Mansel, Robert E</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expression of MLN64 influences cellular matrix adhesion of breast cancer cells, the role for focal adhesion kinase.</title><secondary-title>International journal of molecular medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of molecular medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>573-580</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: antagonis</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolis</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockdown Techniques</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Survival Analysis</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20198306</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijmm_00000379</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijmm/25/4/573</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20198306</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64) gene was initially identified as highly expressed in the metastatic lymph node from breast cancer. It is localized in q12-q21 of the human chromosome 17 and is often co-amplified with erbB-2. However, the role played by MLN64 in breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of MLN64 was examined in a breast cancer cohort using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. It demonstrated that MLN64 was highly expressed in breast tumours compared to corresponding background tissues at both transcript level and protein level. The elevated level of MLN64 transcripts was correlated with the poor prognosis and overall survival of the patients. A panel of breast cancer cell sublines was subsequently developed by knockdown of MLN64 expression. Loss of MLN64 expression in MCF-7 cells resulted in a significant reduction of cell growth (absorbance for MCF-7DeltaMLN64 being 0.87+/-0.07, P&lt;0.01 vs. wild-type control (MCF-7WT 1.13+/-0.06) and transfection control (MCF-7pEF 1.27+/-0.05). In cell-matrix adhesion assay, MDA-MB-231DeltaMLN64 cells showed a significant increase in adhesion (86+/-14), p&lt;0.01 compared with both MDA-MB-231WT (61+/-20) and MDA-MB-231pEF (45+/-27). Further investigations demonstrated an increase in protein level of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in MDA-MB-231DeltaMLN64 cells using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining of FAK. Moreover, addition of FAK inhibitor to these cells diminished the effect of MLN64 on cell-matrix adhesion, suggesting that FAK contributed to the increased adhesion in MDA-MB-231DeltaMLN64 cells. In conclusion, MLN64 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and its level correlates with poor prognosis and patient survival. MLN64 contributes to the development and progression of breast cancer through the regulation of cell proliferation and adhesive capacity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grinnell, K L</author><author>Casserly, B</author><author>Harrington, E O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in barrier function of pulmonary endothelium.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) have been shown to affect both cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell junctions. The SH2 domain-containing nonreceptor PTP, SHP2, is involved in intercellular signaling through direct interaction with adherens junction proteins. In this study, we examined the role of SHP2 in pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Inhibition of SHP2 promoted edema formation in rat lungs and increased monolayer permeability in cultured lung endothelial cells. In addition, pulmonary endothelial cells demonstrated a decreased level of p190RhoGAP activity following inhibition of SHP2, events that were accompanied by a concomitant increase in RhoA activity. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed enhanced actin stress fiber formation and diminished interendothelial staining of adherens junction complex-associated proteins upon SHP2 inhibition. Finally, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, beta-catenin, and p190RhoGAP proteins, as well as decreased association between p120-catenin and VE-cadherin proteins. Our findings suggest that SHP2 supports basal pulmonary endothelial barrier function by coordinating the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of VE-cadherin, beta-catenin, and p190RhoGAP and the activity of RhoA, signaling molecules important in adherens junction complex integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lembo, Annalisa</author><author>Gurney, Michael a</author><author>Burnside, Kellie</author><author>Banerjee, Anirban</author><author>de los Reyes, Melissa</author><author>Connelly, James E</author><author>Lin, Wan-Jung</author><author>Jewell, Kelsea a</author><author>Vo, Anthony</author><author>Renken, Christian W</author><author>Doran, Kelly S</author><author>Rajagopal, Lakshmi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of CovR expression in Group B Streptococcus impacts blood-brain barrier penetration.</title><secondary-title>Molecular microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>431-443</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: genetics</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>Post-Translational</keyword><keyword>Protein Processing</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>Sepsis: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections</keyword><keyword>Streptococcal Infections: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae: genetics</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus agalactiae: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Virulence Factors</keyword><keyword>Virulence Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Virulence Factors: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20497331</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07215.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Regulation of CovR expression in Group B Streptococcus impacts blood-brain barrier penetration. - Lembo, Annalisa; Gurney, Michael a; Burnside, Kellie; Banerjee, Anirban; de los Reyes, Melissa; Connelly, James E; Lin, Wan-Jung; Jewell, Kelsea a; Vo, Anthony; Renken, Christian W; Doran, Kelly S; Rajagopal, Lakshmi)

The pathogen encodes a number of virulence factors including the pluripotent beta-haemolysin/cytolysin (beta-H/C). As GBS has the disposition of both a commensal organism and an invasive pathogen, it is important for the organism to appropriately regulate beta-H/C and other virulence factors in response to the environment. GBS can repress transcription of beta-H/C using the two-component system, CovR/CovS. Recently, we described that the serine/threonine kinase Stk1 can phosphorylate CovR at threonine 65 to relieve repression of beta-H/C. In this study, we show that infection with CovR-deficient GBS strains resulted in increased sepsis. Although CovR-deficient GBS showed decreased ability to invade the brain endothelium in vitro, they were more proficient in induction of permeability and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in brain endothelium and penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Microarray analysis revealed that CovR positively regulates its own expression and regulates the expression of 153 genes. Collectively, our results suggest that the positive feedback loop which regulates CovR transcription modulates host cell interaction and immune defence and may facilitate the transition of GBS from a commensal organism to a virulent meningeal pathogen.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lv, Shan</author><author>Wu, Lin</author><author>Cheng, Peng</author><author>Yu, Jing</author><author>Zhang, Aisen</author><author>Zha, Juanmin</author><author>Liu, Juan</author><author>Wang, Long</author><author>DI, Wenjuan</author><author>Hu, Miao</author><author>Qi, Hanmei</author><author>Li, Yujie</author><author>Ding, Guoxian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correlation of obesity and osteoporosis: Effect of free fatty acids on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.</title><secondary-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>603-610</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>3</keyword><keyword>belongs to the cxc</keyword><keyword>by the il-8 gene</keyword><keyword>chemokine family</keyword><keyword>chromosome 4q12-q21</keyword><keyword>il-8 has been shown</keyword><keyword>il-8 is a small</keyword><keyword>interleukin-8</keyword><keyword>interleukin-8 receptor</keyword><keyword>protein that is encoded</keyword><keyword>to be linked to</keyword><keyword>which is located on</keyword><keyword>wound healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>22993583</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/etm_00000095</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3445940&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Wound Healing</label><abstract>Studies on the relationship between obesity and bone have recently become widespread. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of obesity on bone, utilizing a diet-induced obese mouse model, and to explore the role of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the osteogenesis/adipogenesis of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). An obese mouse model was established by a high-fat diet (HFD). Proximal femurs were collected at sacrifice, and bone mineral density (BMD) in the proximal femurs was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone histomorphometry was performed using undecalcified sections of the proximal femurs. The effect of obesity on the differentiation of mouse BMSCs was assessed by colony formation assays and gene expression analysis. In vitro, various osteogenic and adipogenic genes were determined by real-time quantitative PCR in mouse BMSCs after exposure to conditioned medium (CM) from FFA-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Western blotting was further performed to analyze the representative protein expression of PPARγ and Runx2. BMD and trabecular thickness were significantly greater in the HFD mice than in the control mice. CFU-osteo assay showed significantly increased osteogenesis of BMSCs. The mRNA level of Runx2 was significantly higher, while PPARγ and Pref-1 were significantly lower in BMSCs from the HFD mice compared to the control mice. In mouse BMSCs, the Sox9 and Runx2 genes were significantly up-regulated after exposure to CM from FFA-treated adipocytes, while PPARγ and CEBP-α were significantly down-regulated. Osteogenesis was significantly increased, while adipogenesis was significantly decreased. In conclusion, HFD-induced obesity may play a protective role in bone formation by concomitantly promoting osteogenic and suppressing adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs through factors secreted by FFA-treated adipocytes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chakraborty, Prabir K</author><author>Lee, Wing-Kee</author><author>Molitor, Malte</author><author>Wolff, Natascha A</author><author>Thévenod, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cadmium induces Wnt signaling to upregulate proliferation and survival genes in sub-confluent kidney proximal tubule cells.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>102</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcriptio</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadmium</keyword><keyword>Cadmium: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Transformation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Confocal</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoblotting</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Kidney Tubules</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proximal</keyword><keyword>Proximal: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Proximal: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Wnt Proteins</keyword><keyword>Wnt Proteins: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Wnt Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Wnt Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: drug effects</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: genetics</keyword><keyword>beta Catenin: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20459685</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1476-4598-9-102</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2873433&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: The class 1 carcinogen cadmium (Cd2+) disrupts the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex of epithelial adherens junctions (AJs) and causes renal cancer. Deregulation of E-cadherin adhesion and changes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are known to contribute to carcinogenesis. RESULTS: We investigated Wnt signaling after Cd2+-induced E-cadherin disruption in sub-confluent cultured kidney proximal tubule cells (PTC). Cd2+ (25 microM, 3-9 h) caused nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and triggered a Wnt response measured by TOPflash reporter assays. Cd2+ reduced the interaction of beta-catenin with AJ components (E-cadherin, alpha-catenin) and increased binding to the transcription factor TCF4 of the Wnt pathway, which was upregulated and translocated to the nucleus. While Wnt target genes (c-Myc, cyclin D1 and ABCB1) were up-regulated by Cd2+, electromobility shift assays showed increased TCF4 binding to cyclin D1 and ABCB1 promoter sequences with Cd2+. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant TCF4 confirmed Cd2+-induced Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling elicited by Cd2+ was not observed in confluent non-proliferating cells, which showed increased E-cadherin expression. Overexpression of E-cadherin reduced Wnt signaling, PTC proliferation and Cd2+ toxicity. Cd2+ also induced reactive oxygen species dependent expression of the pro-apoptotic ER stress marker and Wnt suppressor CHOP/GADD153 which, however, did not abolish Wnt response and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Cd2+ induces Wnt signaling in PTC. Hence, Cd2+ may facilitate carcinogenesis of PTC by promoting Wnt pathway-mediated proliferation and survival of pre-neoplastic cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cavet, M E</author><author>VanDerMeid, K R</author><author>Harrington, K L</author><author>Tchao, R</author><author>Ward, K W</author><author>Zhang, J-Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of a novel multipurpose contact lens solution on human corneal epithelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>Contact lens &amp; anterior eye : the journal of the British Contact Lens Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contact lens &amp; anterior eye : the journal of the British Contact Lens Association</full-title></periodical><pages>S18-23</pages><volume>33 Suppl 1</volume><keywords><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Contact Lens Solutions</keyword><keyword>Contact Lens Solutions: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Corneal</keyword><keyword>Corneal: cytology</keyword><keyword>Corneal: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Corneal: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: ultrastructure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>21051274</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.clae.2010.06.012</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Effect of a novel multipurpose contact lens solution on human corneal epithelial barrier function. - Cavet, M E; VanDerMeid, K R; Harrington, K L; Tchao, R; Ward, K W; Zhang, J-Z)

Measurements of wound repair were performed using continuous impedance sensing to determine the time course for wound closure. Control experiments showed that the increase in impedance corresponding to cell migration into the wound was blocked by treatment with the actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D. Time lapse imaging revealed that NHBE and Calu-3 cell wound closure was dependent on cell migration, and that movement occurred as a collective sheet of cells. Selective inhibition of CFTR activity with CFTR(inh)-172 or short hairpin RNA silencing of CFTR expression produced a significant delay in wound repair. The CF cell line UNCCF1T also exhibited significantly slower migration than comparable normal airway epithelial cells. Inhibition of CFTR-dependent anion transport by treatment with CFTR(inh)-172 slowed wound closure to the same extent as silencing CFTR protein expression, indicating that ion transport by CFTR plays a critical role in migration. Moreover, morphologic analysis of migrating cells revealed that CFTR inhibition or silencing significantly reduced lamellipodia protrusion. These findings support the conclusion that CFTR participates in airway epithelial wound repair by a mechanism involving anion transport that is coupled to the regulation of lamellipodia protrusion at the leading edge of the cell.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sansom, Sarah E</author><author>Nuovo, Gerard J</author><author>Martin, Mickey M</author><author>Kotha, Sainath R</author><author>Parinandi, Narasimham L</author><author>Elton, Terry S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-802 regulates human angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression in intestinal epithelial C2BBe1 cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Ang II is also a proinflammatory mediator that participates in inflammatory responses such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling; accumulating evidence suggests that this hormone may be involved in gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and carcinogenesis. Ang II binds to two distinct G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, the AT(1)R and AT(2)R, which are widely expressed in the GI system. Together these studies suggest that Ang II-AT(1)R/-AT(2)R actions may play an important role in GI tract physiology and pathophysiology. Currently it is not known whether miRNAs can regulate the expression of the human AT(1)R (hAT(1)R) in the GI system. PCR and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that miR-802 was abundantly expressed in human colon and intestine. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-802 could directly interact with the bioinformatics-predicted target site harbored within the 3'-untranslated region of the hAT(1)R mRNA. To validate that the levels of miR-802 were physiologically relevant in the GI system, we demonstrated that miR-802 &quot;loss-of-function&quot; experiments resulted in augmented hAT(1)R levels and enhanced Ang II-induced signaling in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. These results suggest that miR-802 can modulate the expression of the hAT(1)R in the GI tract and ultimately play a role in regulating the biological efficacy of Ang II in this system.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Male, Keith B</author><author>Crowley, Stephan M</author><author>Collins, Stuart G</author><author>Tzeng, Yew-Min</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-based impedance spectroscopy for probing inhibitory effects of steroids and ergostane/lanosta-related compounds</title><secondary-title>Analytical Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>870</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c0ay00105h</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c0ay00105h</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Electric cell–substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used for probing inhibitory effects on Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells exposed to five synthesized steroid compounds. The results were compared to the levels obtained using three ergostane-related steroids and five lanosta-related triterpenes purified from the fruiting bodies of Antrodia camphorata. The half-inhibition concentration (ECIS50), the level of 50% inhibition of the resistance response, was determined from the response function to establish inhibitory effects of the different compounds. Significant effects on inhibition as probed by impedance spectroscopy were noticed because of slight changes in chemical structure. Only two of the synthesized compounds, 24(R,S)-5α-lanost-8-ene-3,24,25-triol and 5α-lanost-8-ene-3,7,11-trione, showed inhibitory effects which were much less significant compared to the A. camphorata steroids. The ECIS50 values were 150–250 µM, similar to the value for the least inhibitory lanosta-related triterpene. This noninvasive measurement in combination with Sf9 insect cells has been proven as a simple and reliable tool for screening inhibition/cytotoxicity and designing steroid-related compounds.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hynes, Anne</author><author>Mohanraj, Bhavana</author><author>Schiele, Nate</author><author>Corr, David T</author><author>Plopper, George E</author><author>Dinu, Cerasela Zoica</author><author>Chrisey, Douglas B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-Based Detection of Bacillus Cereus Anthrax Simulant Using Cell Impedance Sensing</title><secondary-title>Sensor Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensor Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>528-533</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1166/sl.2010.1306</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=1546-198X&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=528</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Min</author><author>Zhao, Jinshun</author><author>Bowman, Linda</author><author>Lu, Yongju</author><author>Shi, Xianglin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of AP-1 and MAPK signaling and activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway by quercitrin.</title><secondary-title>International journal of oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-67</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antioxidants</keyword><keyword>Antioxidants: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens</keyword><keyword>Comet Assay</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2</keyword><keyword>NF-E2-Related Factor 2: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Quercetin</keyword><keyword>Quercetin: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Quercetin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Response Elements</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factor AP-1</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factor AP-1: antagonists &amp; inhibitor</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation</keyword><keyword>Transgenic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19956833</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijo_00000475</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/36/1/59</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19956833</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quercitrin, glycosylated form of flavonoid compounds, is widely distributed in nature. Extensive studies have demonstrated that quercitrin exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic activities. However, the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. The present study examines the effects of quercitrin on tumor promotion in mouse JB6 cells, a validated model for screening cancer chemopreventive agents and elucidating the molecular mechanisms. Quercitrin blocked TPA-induced neoplastic transformation in JB6 P+ cells. Pretreatment of JB6 cells with quercitrin down-regulated transactivation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB induced by UVB or TPA. In the skin of AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice, topical treatment of the mouse with quercitrin markedly blocked the TPA-induced AP-1 transactivation. Further studies indicated that these inhibitory actions appear to be mediated through the inhibition of MAPKs phosphorylation, including ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs. In addition, quercitrin stimulated the activation of NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) and GST ARE-luciferase activity. Comet assays showed that quercitrin could block DNA damage induced by UVB. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that quercitrin contributes to the inhibition of neoplastic transformation by blocking activation of the MAPK pathway and stimulation of cellular protection signaling. Moreover, to our knowledge, these findings provide the first molecular basis for the anti-carcinogenic action of quercitrin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Patel, Girish</author><author>Harding, Keith G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expression of WAVEs, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family of verprolin homologous proteins in human wound tissues and the biological influence on human keratinocytes.</title><secondary-title>Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society</full-title></periodical><pages>594-604</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Skin</keyword><keyword>Skin: injuries</keyword><keyword>Skin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Staining and Labeling</keyword><keyword>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family</keyword><keyword>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family: metabolis</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: physiology</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20946142</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00630.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20946142</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>WAVEs (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homologs) regulate actin polymerization and influence cellular motility. Here, we investigated the pattern of expression of WAVE-1, WAVE-2, and WAVE-3, in a cohort of human wound tissues together with normal skins and evaluated the role of these molecules in the reepithelialization and migration of keratinocytes. It was shown that there was a significant reduction of the WAVE-3 transcripts in chronic wound tissues, when compared with normal skin and acute wound tissue (p=0.002). Marginal reduction of the WAVE-1 and WAVE-2 transcripts in chronic wounds were also seen. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant reduction of all three WAVE proteins in chronic wound tissues in comparison with the acute. We created in vitro cell models using keratinocytes in which we overexpressed WAVE-2, and knocked down the expression of WAVE-1 and WAVE-3. Using ECIS assay, it was shown that knocking down WAVE-3 had a significant effect on the migration and reepithelialization of keratinocytes and that overexpression of WAVE-2 also increased the migration of keratinocytes. We further demonstrated that the impact of WAVE on cell migration was independent upon the PLCg and ERK pathways, but in the downstream requires PI3K pathway and ROCK pathways. In conclusion, the WAVE family proteins are essential for the reepithelialization of keratinocytes. Aberrant expression of WAVEs is linked to the healing process of clinical wounds and loss of WAVE-3 is a particular indicator of an abnormally healing wound. The WAVE proteins have a significant predicative and therapeutic value in wound healing.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huppert, Jula</author><author>Closhen, Dorothea</author><author>Croxford, Andrew</author><author>White, Robin</author><author>Kulig, Paulina</author><author>Pietrowski, Eweline</author><author>Bechmann, Ingo</author><author>Becher, Burkhard</author><author>Luhmann, Heiko J</author><author>Waisman, Ari</author><author>Kuhlmann, Christoph R W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cellular mechanisms of IL-17-induced blood-brain barrier disruption.</title><secondary-title>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1023-1034</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Autoimmune</keyword><keyword>Azepines</keyword><keyword>Azepines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: immunology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation: immunology</keyword><keyword>Encephalomyelitis</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: immunology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Experimental</keyword><keyword>Experimental: immun</keyword><keyword>Experimental: immunology</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metab</keyword><keyword>Experimental: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Experimental: patho</keyword><keyword>Experimental: pathology</keyword><keyword>Helper-Inducer</keyword><keyword>Helper-Inducer: immunology</keyword><keyword>Helper-Inducer: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Helper-Inducer: pathology</keyword><keyword>Inbred BALB C</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-17</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-17: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-17: immunology</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-17: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-17: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: immunology</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: immunology</keyword><keyword>NADPH Oxidase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neutralizing</keyword><keyword>Neutralizing: immunology</keyword><keyword>Neutralizing: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Occludin</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress: immunology</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: immunology</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>Transformed</keyword><keyword>Xanthine Oxidase</keyword><keyword>Xanthine Oxidase: immunology</keyword><keyword>Xanthine Oxidase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>multiple sclerosis</keyword><keyword>neuroinflammation</keyword><keyword>reactive</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>19940258</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.09-141978</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Cellular mechanisms of IL-17-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. - Huppert, Jula; Closhen, Dorothea; Croxford, Andrew; White, Robin; Kulig, Paulina; Pietrowski, Eweline; Bechmann, Ingo; Becher, Burkhard; Luhmann, Heiko J; Waisman, Ari; Kuhlmann, Christoph R W)

The aim of the present study was to examine the mechanisms that underlie IL-17A-induced BBB breakdown. Barrier integrity was analyzed in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 by measuring the electrical resistance values using electrical call impedance sensing technology. Furthermore, in-cell Western blots, fluorescence imaging, and monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration assays were performed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice. IL-17A induced NADPH oxidase- or xanthine oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The resulting oxidative stress activated the endothelial contractile machinery, which was accompanied by a down-regulation of the tight junction molecule occludin. Blocking either ROS formation or myosin light chain phosphorylation or applying IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies prevented IL-17A-induced BBB disruption. Treatment of mice with EAE using ML-7, an inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase, resulted in less BBB disruption at the spinal cord and less infiltration of lymphocytes via the BBB and subsequently reduced the clinical characteristics of EAE. These observations indicate that IL-17A accounts for a crucial step in the development of EAE by impairing the integrity of the BBB, involving augmented production of ROS.-Huppert, J., Closhen, D., Croxford, A., White, R., Kulig, P., Pietrowski, E., Bechmann, I., Becher, B., Luhmann, H.

This study has investigated effects of TNF-alpha, which is implicated in corneal allograft rejection, on microtubules and barrier integrity in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells. Exposure to TNF-alpha led to disassembly of the microtubules, and also caused disruption of the perijunctional actomyosin ring (PAMR). As a measure of barrier integrity, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TER) was determined based on electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing in realtime. Exposure to TNF-alpha caused a slow decline in TER for &gt; 20 h, and a similar exposure to cells grown on porous culture inserts led to a significant increase in permeability to FITC dextran. These changes, indicating a loss of barrier integrity, were also reflected by dislocation of ZO-1 at the cell border and disassembly of cadherins. These effects of TNF-alpha were inhibited upon stabilization of microtubules by pre-treatment with paclitaxel or epothilone B. Microtubule stabilization may be a useful strategy to overcome (TNF-alpha)-induced loss of the barrier integrity of corneal endothelium during inflammation associated with transplant rejection and uveitis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lovelady, Douglas C</author><author>Friedman, Jennifer</author><author>Patel, Sonali</author><author>Rabson, David a</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detecting effects of low levels of cytochalasin B in 3T3 fibroblast cultures by analysis of electrical noise obtained from cellular micromotion.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>2250-2254</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>3T3 Cells</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Artifacts</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B: analysis</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: methods</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Motion</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19026529</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2008.09.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2673106&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>We performed micromotion experiments using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) on a confluent layer of 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to different low levels of the toxin cytochalasin B. This toxin is know to affect actin polymerization and to disrupt cytoskeletal structure and function in cells, changing the morphology of confluent cell cultures and altering the nature of the cellular micromotion, which is measured by ECIS as changes in impedance. By looking at several measures to characterize the long- and short-term correlations in the noise of the impedance time series, we are able to detect the effects of the toxin at concentrations down to 1 microM; there are intriguing hints that the effects may be discernible at levels as low as 0.1 microM. These measures include the power spectrum, the Hurst and detrended-fluctuation-analysis exponents, and the first zero and first 1/e crossings of the autocorrelation function. While most published work with ECIS uses only average impedance values, we demonstrate that noise analysis provides a more sensitive probe.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, Abdur Rub Abdur</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Bhansali, Shekhar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A detailed model for high-frequency impedance characterization of ovarian cancer epithelial cell layer using ECIS electrodes.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>485-492</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19272881</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TBME.2008.2008488</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19272881</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS Theory</label><abstract>We report on the electrical impedance spectroscopy characterization of OVCA429 ovarian cancer cells. A commercially available eight-well cell culture impedance array (ECIS-8W1E), commonly used in electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), was used for OVCA429 characterization. Impedances of ECIS-8W1E array were recorded with cell culture medium (without cells) and with OVCA429 cell layer in the culture medium between 100 Hz and 10 MHz frequency. Physiological and interfacial components of experimental impedance data were modeled by equivalent circuit fitting, using a newly developed model. Impedance measurements with cell culture medium show only two semicircles in the admittance plane, which are identified as: 1) low-frequency semicircle due to impedance of gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte and 2) high-frequency semicircle due to impedance of polymer-coated region of the gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte. In the presence of OVCA429 cell layer, three convolved semicircles are observed in the Cole-Cole plane, which are identified as the interfacial impedance in series with the cell layer impedance. The average resistance and capacitance of the OVCA429 cell layer was found to be 152+/-59 ohm x cm(2) and 8.5+/-2.4 microF/cm(2), respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Opp, Daniel</author><author>Wafula, Brian</author><author>Lim, Jennifer</author><author>Huang, Eric</author><author>Lo, Jun-Chih</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to assess in vitro cytotoxicity.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>2625-2629</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin B: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Impedance</keyword><keyword>Impedance: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Impedance: methods</keyword><keyword>Plethysmography</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: instrumentation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19230649</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2009.01.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2668605&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS Cytotoxicity;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>In vitro assessment of cytotoxicity based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) needs more quantitative methods to analyze the alteration of cell morphology and motility, and hence the potential risk to human health. Here, we applied electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to evaluate dose-dependent responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to cytochalasin B. To detect subtle changes in cell morphology, the frequency-dependent impedance data of the cell monolayer were measured and analyzed with a theoretical cell-electrode model. To detect the alternation of cell micromotion in response to cytochalasin B challenge, time-series impedance fluctuations of cell-covered electrodes were monitored and the values of power spectrum, variance, and variance of the increments were calculated to verify the difference. While a dose-dependent relationship was generally observed from the overall resistance of the cell monolayer, the analysis of frequency-dependent impedance and impedance fluctuations distinguished cytochalasin B levels as low as 0.1 microM. Our results show that cytochalasin B causes a decrease of junctional resistance between cells, an increase of membrane capacitance, and the reduction in micromotion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarai, Kei</author><author>Shikata, Kenichi</author><author>Shikata, Yasushi</author><author>Omori, Kazuyoshi</author><author>Watanabe, Naomi</author><author>Sasaki, Motofumi</author><author>Nishishita, Shingo</author><author>Wada, Jun</author><author>Goda, Noriko</author><author>Kataoka, Noriyuki</author><author>Makino, Hirofumi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endothelial barrier protection by FTY720 under hyperglycemic condition: involvement of focal adhesion kinase, small GTPases, and adherens junction proteins.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

FTY720 is a S1P analog originally developed as a novel immunosuppressant. The phosphorylated form of FTY720 binds to S1P receptors to exert S1P-like biological effects, suggesting endothelial barrier promotion by FTY720. To elucidate whether FTY720 induces signaling events related to endothelial barrier enhancement under hyperglycemic conditions, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) preincubated with hyperglycemic (30 mM) medium were treated with 100 nM FTY720 for 3 h. Immunofluorescent microscopy and coprecipitation study revealed FTY720-induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-associated adherens junction (AJ) assembly at cell-cell contacts coincident with formation of a prominent cortical actin ring. FTY720 also induced transmonolayer electrical resistance (TER) augmentation in HMVEC monolayers in both normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions, implying endothelial barrier enhancement. Similar to S1P, site-specific FAK tyrosine phosphorylation analysis revealed FTY720-induced FAK [Y576] phosphorylation without phosphorylation of FAK [Y397/Y925]. Furthermore, FTY720 conditioned the phosphorylation profile of FAK [Y397/Y576/Y925] in hyperglycemic medium to the same pattern observed in normoglycemic medium. FTY720 challenge resulted in small GTPase Rac activation under hyperglycemic conditions, whereas increased Rho activity in hyperglycemic medium was restored to the basal level. Rac protein depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique completely abolished FTY720-induced FAK [Y576] phosphorylation. These findings strongly suggest the barrier protective effect of FTY720 on HMVEC monolayers in hyperglycemic medium via S1P signaling, further implying the possibility of FTY720 as a therapeutic agent of diabetic vascular disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Mingzhang</author><author>Daines, Dayle</author><author>Tang, Jing</author><author>Shen, Qiang</author><author>Perrin, Rachel M</author><author>Takada, Yoshikazu</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y</author><author>Wu, Mack H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fibrinogen-gamma C-terminal fragments induce endothelial barrier dysfunction and microvascular leak via integrin-mediated and RhoA-dependent mechanism.</title><secondary-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>394-400</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Albumins</keyword><keyword>Albumins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Amides</keyword><keyword>Amides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Fibrinogen</keyword><keyword>Fibrinogen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Integrin alphaVbeta3</keyword><keyword>Integrin alphaVbeta3: genetics</keyword><keyword>Integrin alphaVbeta3: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Integrin beta3</keyword><keyword>Integrin beta3: genetics</keyword><keyword>Integrin beta3: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments</keyword><keyword>Peptide Fragments: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pyridines</keyword><keyword>Pyridines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Splanchnic Circulation</keyword><keyword>Sprague-Dawley</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Video</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: antagonists &amp;

We have previously shown differential remodeling of focal adhesions (FA) caused by barrier-protective and barrier-disruptive mechanical and chemical stimuli. This study examined a role of FA protein paxillin in the pulmonary EC barrier responses induced by HGF and VEGF. VEGF increased, but HGF decreased, pulmonary EC permeability. These effects were accompanied by differential patterns of site-specific phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin and FA redistribution. HGF antagonized random FA formation caused by VEGF challenge and promoted FA accumulation at the cell periphery. HGF attenuated VEGF-induced paxillin redistribution, FA remodeling, and endothelial permeability. SiRNA-based paxillin knockdown attenuated VEGF-induced EC permeability, myosin light chain phosphorylation, and stress fiber and paracellular gap formation. Paxillin knockdown also decreased HGF-induced EC barrier enhancement and suppressed activation of Rac and its effector PAK1. Expression of paxillin-S(273) deficient on PAK1 phosphorylation site prevented HGF-induced cytoskeletal remodeling. These data show a dual role of paxillin in the HGF- and VEGF-mediated endothelial barrier regulation and suggest essential paxillin role in the modulation of Rac-Rho crosstalk. Our results also support a model of pulmonary EC barrier recovery during resolution of ALI via switch from VEGF to HGF signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breslin, Jerome W</author><author>Kurtz, Kristine M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lymphatic endothelial cells adapt their barrier function in response to changes in shear stress.</title><secondary-title>Lymphatic research and biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lymphatic research and biology</full-title></periodical><pages>229-237</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Controlled</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dermis</keyword><keyword>Dermis: cytology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mechanical</keyword><keyword>Stress</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>20143922</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/lrb.2009.0015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2883493&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Flow;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Lymphatic endothelial cells form an important barrier necessary for normal lymph formation and propulsion.

Our results showed that (a) platelet-NPC aggregates (PNA) were associated with higher shear-induced P-selectin expression and glycoprotein alpha(II)beta(3) activation than platelet-platelet aggregates (PPA); (b) strenuous exercise (SE, up to VO2max), but not moderate exercise (ME, 60% VO2max for 30 min), increased both PPA and PNA in mimicked venous and arterial circuits and enhanced PNA in mimicked flow of stenotic vessels; (c) the percentages of PNA that remained bound to ECs in mimicked flow of post-capillary venules increased, while platelet-induced CD44 cleavage on NPC and trans-endothelial migration of NPC were enhanced following SE, but were unchanged in response to ME. We conclude that SE, but not ME, enhances the capacity of PNA to adhere to ECs, withstand flowing blood, and facilitate the invasion of NPCs toward ECs.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grab, Dennis J</author><author>Garcia-Garcia, Jose C</author><author>Nikolskaia, Olga V</author><author>Kim, Yuri V</author><author>Brown, Amanda</author><author>Pardo, Carlos a</author><author>Zhang, Yongqing</author><author>Becker, Kevin G</author><author>Wilson, Brenda a</author><author>de A Lima, Ana Paula C</author><author>Scharfstein, Julio</author><author>Dumler, J Stephen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protease activated receptor signaling is required for African trypanosome traversal of human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>e479</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Toxins: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: parasitology</keyword><keyword>Gene Silencing</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>PAR-2</keyword><keyword>PAR-2: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>PAR-2: genetics</keyword><keyword>PAR-2: physiology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense: pathogenicity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19621073</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pntd.0000479</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2707606&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion;ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) as an in vitro model for how African trypanosomes cross the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) we recently reported that the parasites cross the BBB by generating calcium activation signals in HBMECs through the activity of parasite cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsin L (brucipain).

We have previously shown that LPA stimulates secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in bronchial epithelial cells. This study provides evidence that LPA enhances pulmonary epithelial barrier integrity through protein kinase C (PKC) delta- and zeta-mediated E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. Treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) with LPA increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) by approximately 2.0-fold and enhanced accumulation of E-cadherin to the cell-cell junctions through Galpha(i)-coupled LPA receptors. Knockdown of E-cadherin with E-cadherin small interfering RNA or pretreatment with EGTA (0.1 mm) prior to LPA (1 microm) treatment attenuated LPA-induced increases in TER in HBEpCs. Furthermore, LPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and overexpression of the FAK inhibitor, and FAK-related non-kinase-attenuated LPA induced increases in TER and E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. Overexpression of dominant negative protein kinase delta and zeta attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of FAK, accumulation of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions, and an increase in TER. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide decreased TER and induced E-cadherin relocalization from cell-cell junctions to cytoplasm in a dose-dependent fashion, which was restored by LPA post-treatment in HBEpCs. Intratracheal post-treatment with LPA (5 microm) reduced LPS-induced neutrophil influx, protein leak, and E-cadherin shedding in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in a murine model of acute lung injury. These data suggest a protective role of LPA in airway inflammation and remodeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curtis, Theresa M</author><author>Widder, Mark W</author><author>Brennan, Linda M</author><author>Schwager, Steven J</author><author>van der Schalie, William H</author><author>Fey, Julien</author><author>Salazar, Noe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A portable cell-based impedance sensor for toxicity testing of drinking water.</title><secondary-title>Lab on a chip</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lab on a chip</full-title></periodical><pages>2176-2183</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Chemical</keyword><keyword>Chemical: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Microfluidic Analytical Techniques</keyword><keyword>Microfluidic Analytical Techniques: instrumentatio</keyword><keyword>Microfluidic Analytical Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: methods</keyword><keyword>Water Pollutants</keyword><keyword>Water Supply</keyword><keyword>Water Supply: standards</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19606294</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/b901314h</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (A portable cell-based impedance sensor for toxicity testing of drinking water. - Curtis, Theresa M; Widder, Mark W; Brennan, Linda M; Schwager, Steven J; van der Schalie, William H; Fey, Julien; Salazar, Noe)

This paper describes a portable automated bench-top mammalian cell-based toxicity sensor that incorporates enclosed fluidic biochips containing endothelial cells monitored by Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) technology. Long-term maintenance of cells on the biochips is made possible by using a compact, self-contained disposable media delivery system. The toxicity sensor monitors changes in impedance of cell monolayers on the biochips after the introduction of water samples. The fluidic biochip includes an ECIS electronic layer and a polycarbonate channel layer, which together reduce initial impedance disturbances seen in commercially available open well ECIS chips caused by the mechanics of pipetting while maintaining the ability of the cells to respond to toxicants. A curve discrimination program was developed that compares impedance values over time between the control and treatment channels on the fluidic biochip and determines if they are significantly different. Toxicant responses of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells grown on fluidic biochips are similar to cells on commercially-available open well chips, and these cells can be maintained in the toxicity sensor device for at least nine days using an automated media delivery system. Longer-term cell storage is possible; bovine lung microvessel endothelial cells survive for up to four months on the fluidic biochips and remain responsive to a model toxicant. This is the first demonstration of a portable bench top system capable of both supporting cell health over extended periods of time and obtaining impedance measurements from endothelial cell monolayers after toxicant exposure.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spiering, Désirée</author><author>Schmolke, Mirco</author><author>Ohnesorge, Nils</author><author>Schmidt, Marc</author><author>Goebeler, Matthias</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Wixler, Viktor</author><author>Ludwig, Stephan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MEK5/ERK5 signaling modulates endothelial cell migration and focal contact turnover.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>24972-24980</pages><volume>284</volume><issue>37</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Kinase 5</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Kinase 5: metabolism</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Pathologic</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19605361</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M109.042911</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2757201&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion;ECIS Migration;Signal Transduction;Wound Healing</label><abstract>The formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones requires highly coordinated restructuring of endothelial cells (EC) and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Directed EC migration is a central step in this process and depends on cellular signaling cascades that initiate and control the structural rearrangements. On the basis of earlier findings that ERK5 deficiency in mouse EC results in massive defects in vessel architecture, we focused on the impact of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway on EC migration. Using a retroviral gene transfer approach, we found that constitutive activation of MEK5/ERK5 signaling strongly inhibits EC migration and results in massive morphological changes. The area covered by spread EC was dramatically enlarged, accompanied by an increase in focal contacts and altered organization of actin filaments. Consequently, cells were more rigid and show reduced motility. This phenotype was most likely based on decreased focal contact turnover caused by reduced expression of p130Cas, a key player in directed cell migration. We demonstrate for the first time that ERK5 signaling not only is involved in EC survival and stress response but also controls migration and morphology of EC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Chi-Ming</author><author>Fang, Jia-You</author><author>Lin, Hsin-Huang</author><author>Yang, Chi-Yea</author><author>Hung, Chi-Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lycopene inhibits PDGF-BB-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell migration by suppression of PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways.</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</full-title></periodical><pages>172-176</pages><volume>388</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antioxidants</keyword><keyword>Antioxidants: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Carotenoids</keyword><keyword>Carotenoids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases: antagoni</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: antagonists &amp; inhi</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor: antagonists &amp; inhi</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Platelet-Derived Growth Factor: physiology</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: antagonists &amp; inhib</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Retinal Pigment Epithelium: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>19664603</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.155</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664603</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells play a dominant role in the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), which is the leading cause of failure in retinal reattachment surgery. Several studies have shown that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) exhibits chemotaxis and proliferation effects on RPE cells in PVR. In this study, the inhibitory effect of lycopene on PDGF-BB-induced ARPE19 cell migration is examined. In electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and Transwell migration assays, significant suppression of PDGF-BB-induced ARPE19 cell migration by lycopene is observed. Cell viability assays show no cytotoxicity of lycopene on RPE cells. Lycopene shows no effect on ARPE19 cell adhesion and is found to inhibit PDGF-BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and the underlying signaling pathways of PI3K, Akt, ERK and p38 activation. However, PDGF-BB and lycopene show no effects on JNK activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that lycopene inhibits PDGF-BB-induced ARPE19 cell migration through inhibition of PI3K/Akt, ERK and p38 activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarantola, Marco</author><author>Schneider, David</author><author>Sunnick, Eva</author><author>Adam, Holger</author><author>Pierrat, Sebastien</author><author>Rosman, Christina</author><author>Breus, Vladimir</author><author>Sönnichsen, Carsten</author><author>Basché, Thomas</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytotoxicity of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles indicated by cellular micromotility.</title><secondary-title>ACS nano</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS nano</full-title></periodical><pages>213-222</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biodegradation</keyword><keyword>Contrast Media</keyword><keyword>Contrast Media: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Drug Delivery Systems</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Environmental</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Gold: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Metals</keyword><keyword>Metals: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Nanotechnology</keyword><keyword>Nanotechnology: methods</keyword><keyword>Quantum Dots</keyword><keyword>Semiconductors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19206269</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn800721j</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19206269</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity;ECIS Micromotion;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>In the growing field of nanotechnology, there is an urgent need to sensitively determine the toxicity of nanoparticles since many technical and medical applications are based on controlled exposure to particles, that is, as contrast agents or for drug delivery. Before the in vivo implementation, in vitro cell experiments are required to achieve a detailed knowledge of toxicity and biodegradation as a function of the nanoparticles' physical and chemical properties. In this study, we show that the micromotility of animal cells as monitored by electrical cell-substrate impedance analysis (ECIS) is highly suitable to quantify in vitro cytotoxicity of semiconductor quantum dots and gold nanorods. The method is validated by conventional cytotoxicity testing and accompanied by fluorescence and dark-field microscopy to visualize changes in the cytoskeleton integrity and to determine the location of the particles within the cell.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grab, Dennis J</author><author>Nyarko, E</author><author>Nikolskaia, O V</author><author>Kim, Y V</author><author>Dumler, J S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human brain microvascular endothelial cell traversal by Borrelia burgdorferi requires calcium signaling.</title><secondary-title>Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>422-426</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Borrelia burgdorferi</keyword><keyword>Borrelia burgdorferi: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Estrenes</keyword><keyword>Estrenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Pyrrolidinones</keyword><keyword>Pyrrolidinones: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19489925</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02869.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19489925</url></web-urls></urls><label>Calcium Signaling;ECIS Invasion;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Neurological manifestations of Lyme disease (or neuroborreliosis) occur variably and while it is clear that Borrelia burgdorferi can invade the nervous system, how it does so is not well understood. Pathogen penetration through the blood brain barrier (BBB) is often influenced by calcium signaling in the endothelial cells triggered by extracellular host-pathogen interactions. We examined the traversal of B. burgdorferi across the human BBB using in vitro model systems constructed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) grown on Costar Transwell inserts. Pretreatment of the cell monolayers with BAPTA-AM (an intracellular calcium chelator) or phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 inhibited B. burgdorferi transmigration. By 5 h, BAPTA-AM significantly inhibited (82-99%; p &lt;0.017) spirochete traversal of HBMEC compared to DMSO controls. Spirochete traversal was almost totally blocked (&gt; or =99%; p &lt;0.017) after pretreatment with the PLC-beta inhibitor U73122 as a result of barrier tightening based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). The data suggest a role for calcium signaling in CNS spirochete invasion through endothelial cell barriers.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curtis, Theresa M</author><author>Tabb, Joel</author><author>Romeo, Lori</author><author>Schwager, Steven J</author><author>Widder, Mark W</author><author>van der Schalie, William H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved cell sensitivity and longevity in a rapid impedance-based toxicity sensor.</title><secondary-title>Journal of applied toxicology : JAT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of applied toxicology : JAT</full-title></periodical><pages>374-380</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Chemical</keyword><keyword>Chemical: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Iguanas</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: methods</keyword><keyword>Water Pollutants</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19267359</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jat.1421</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Improved cell sensitivity and longevity in a rapid impedance-based toxicity sensor. - Curtis, Theresa M; Tabb, Joel; Romeo, Lori; Schwager, Steven J; Widder, Mark W; van der Schalie, William H)

Assessment of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell (BPAEC) monolayer electrical impedance with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) showed promise in a previous systematic evaluation of toxicity sensor technologies. The goal of the study reported here was to improve toxicant responsiveness and field portability of this cell-based toxicity sensor. A variety of human cells, non-human mammalian cells, and non-mammalian vertebrate cells were screened for sensitivity to 12 waterborne industrial chemicals. The results of this assessment show that bovine lung microvessel endothelial cell (BLMVEC) monolayers and iguana heart (IgH-2) cell monolayers could detect nine out of the 12 waterborne industrial chemicals, an improvement over the seven chemicals previously detected using BPAEC monolayers. Both the BLMVEC and IgH-2 cell monolayers were tested for their ability for long-term survival on the ECIS test chips in a laboratory environment. Both cell lines were able to maintain high impedance readings on the ECIS electrodes for 37 days, a key trait in developing a field-portable toxicity sensor for water. Cell line optimization has greatly contributed to the on-going development of a field-portable cell-based biosensor that detects with sensitivity a wide range of waterborne toxicants.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Del Gaudio, Costantino</author><author>Bianco, Alessandra</author><author>Folin, Marcella</author><author>Baiguera, Silvia</author><author>Grigioni, Mauro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structural characterization and cell response evaluation of electrospun PCL membranes: micrometric versus submicrometric fibers.</title><secondary-title>Journal of biomedical materials research.

The typical nonwoven architecture allows cell adhesion and proliferation, and supports diffusion of nutrients and waste products. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) electrospun membranes were produced starting from 14% w/v solutions in (a) mixture 1:1 tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide and (b) chloroform. Matrices made up of randomly arranged uniform fibers free of beads were obtained. The average fiber diameters were (a) 0.8 +/- 0.2 microm and (b) 3.6 +/- 0.8 microm. PCL matrices showed the following tensile mechanical properties: tensile modulus (a) 5.0 +/- 0.7 MPa (b) 6.4 +/- 0.2 MPa, yield stress (a) 0.55 +/- 0.06 MPa (b) 0.43 +/- 0.02 MPa, and ultimate tensile stress (a) 1.7 +/- 0.2 MPa and (b) 0.8 +/- 0.1 MPa. The ultimate strain ranged between 300% and 400%. Cytotoxicity of electrospun membranes was continuously evaluated by means of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technique using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). PCL matrices resulted free of toxic amounts of contaminants and/or process by-products. In vitro studies performed by culturing HUVEC on micrometric and submicrometric fibrous mats showed that both structures supported cell adhesion and spreading. However, cells cultured on the micrometric network showed higher vitality and improved interaction with the polymeric fibers, suggesting an increased ability to promote cell colonization.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>English, Anthony E</author><author>Moy, Alan B</author><author>Kruse, Kara L</author><author>Ward, Richard C</author><author>Kirkpatrick, Stacy S</author><author>Goldman, Mitchell H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Instrumental noise estimates stabilize and quantify endothelial cell micro-impedance barrier function parameter estimates</title><secondary-title>Biomedical Signal Processing and Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedical Signal Processing and Control</full-title></periodical><pages>86-93</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bspc.2008.12.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1746809408000827</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Jing</author><author>Smith, Anita</author><author>Nechtman, John</author><author>Podolsky, Robert</author><author>Aggarwal, Saurabh</author><author>Snead, Connie</author><author>Kumar, Sanjiv</author><author>Elgaish, Manal</author><author>Oishi, Peter</author><author>Göerlach, Agnes</author><author>Fratz, Sohrab</author><author>Hess, John</author><author>Catravas, John D</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Fineman, Jeffrey R</author><author>She, Jin-Xiong</author><author>Black, Stephen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of PPARgamma inhibition on pulmonary endothelial cell gene expression: gene profiling in pulmonary hypertension.</title><secondary-title>Physiological genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physiological genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>48-60</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Anilides</keyword><keyword>Anilides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Arteries</keyword><keyword>Arteries: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Arteries: pathology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Air Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Air Barrier: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Blood-Air Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypertension</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: pathology</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>PPAR gamma</keyword><keyword>PPAR gamma: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Physiologic</keyword><keyword>Physiologic: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Physiologic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary: pathology</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Sheep</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin</keyword><keyword>Ubiquitin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Zinc Fingers</keyword><keyword>Zinc Fingers: genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19825830</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1152/physiolgenomics.00094.2009</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

Recent studies indicate that loss of PPARgamma is associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). We hypothesized that the endothelial dysfunction associated with PPARgamma inhibition may play an important role in the disease process by altering cellular gene expression and signaling cascades. We utilized microarray analysis to determine if PPARgamma inhibition induced changes in gene expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC). We identified 100 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that were upregulated by &gt;1.5-fold and 21 genes and ESTs that were downregulated by &gt;1.3-fold (P &lt; 0.05) by PPARgamma inhibition. The upregulated genes can be broadly classified into four functional groups: cell cycle, angiogenesis, ubiquitin system, and zinc finger proteins. The genes with the highest fold change in expression: hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1), endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), and caveolin-1 in PAEC were validated by real time RT-PCR. We further validated the upregulation of HMMR, Flk-1, FGF2, and caveolin-1 by Western blot analysis. In keeping with the microarray results, PPARgamma inhibition led to re-entry of cell cycle at G(1)/S phase and cyclin C upregulation. PPARgamma inhibition also exacerbated VEGF-induced endothelial barrier disruption. Finally we confirmed the downregulation of PPARgamma and the upregulation of HMMR, Flk-1, FGF2, and Cav-1 proteins in the peripheral lung tissues of an ovine model of PH. In conclusion, we have identified an array of endothelial genes modulated by attenuated PPARgamma signaling that may play important roles in the development of PH.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Apopa, Patrick L</author><author>Qian, Yong</author><author>Shao, Rong</author><author>Guo, Nancy Lan</author><author>Schwegler-Berry, Diane</author><author>Pacurari, Maricica</author><author>Porter, Dale</author><author>Shi, Xianglin</author><author>Vallyathan, Val</author><author>Castranova, Vincent</author><author>Flynn, Daniel C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron oxide nanoparticles induce human microvascular endothelial cell permeability through reactive oxygen species production and microtubule remodeling.</title><secondary-title>Particle and fibre toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Particle and fibre toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19134195</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-8977-6-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Iron oxide nanoparticles induce human microvascular endothelial cell permeability through reactive oxygen species production and microtubule remodeling. - Apopa, Patrick L; Qian, Yong; Shao, Rong; Guo, Nancy Lan; Schwegler-Berry, Diane; Pacurari, Maricica; Porter, Dale; Shi, Xianglin; Vallyathan, Val; Castranova, Vincent; Flynn, Daniel C)

As a G-protein-coupled receptor, PAR-1 transmits thrombin signal through activation of the heterotrimeric G proteins, Gi, Gq, and G12/13. In this study, we demonstrated that zyxin, a LIM-domain-containing protein, is involved in thrombin-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling and serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription. We determined that zyxin binds to the C-terminal domain of PAR-1, providing a possible mechanism of involvement of zyxin as a signal transducer in PAR-1 signaling. Data showing that disruption of PAR-1-zyxin interaction inhibited thrombin-induced stress fiber formation and SRE activation supports this hypothesis. Similarly, depletion of zyxin using siRNA inhibited thrombin-induced actin stress fiber formation and SRE-dependent gene transcription. In addition, depletion of zyxin resulted in delay of endothelial barrier restoration after thrombin treatment. Notably, down-regulation of zyxin did not affect thrombin-induced activation of RhoA or Gi, Gq, and G12/13 heterotrimeric G proteins, implicating a novel signaling pathway regulated by PAR-1 that is not mediated by G-proteins. The observation that zyxin targets VASP, a partner of zyxin in regulation of actin assembly and dynamics, to focal adhesions and along stress fibers on thrombin stimulation suggests that zyxin may participate in thrombin-induced cytoskeletal remodeling through recruitment of VASP. In summary, this study establishes a crucial role of zyxin in thrombin signaling in endothelial cells and provides evidence for a novel PAR-1 signaling pathway mediated by zyxin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slaughter, Gymama E</author><author>Hobson, Rosalyn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An impedimetric biosensor based on PC 12 cells for the monitoring of exogenous agents.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>1153-1158</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay</keyword><keyword>Biological Assay: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Drug Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>PC12 Cells</keyword><keyword>Pharmaceutical Preparations</keyword><keyword>Pharmaceutical Preparations: administration &amp; dosa</keyword><keyword>Preclinical</keyword><keyword>Preclinical: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Preclinical: methods</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>18760912</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2008.06.060</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18760912</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>The effect of exogenous agents on the complex impedance of PC 12 cells that were cultured to confluency on 250-mum gold microdot electrodes fabricated within 8-well cell culture biochips was studied. Surface attachment of PC 12 cells to gold microelectrodes was accomplished using cysteamine SAMs covalently derivatized with laminin. The impedimetric response of PC 12 cells that undergo calcium exocytosis in the presence of calcimycin, nifedipine, mannitol and carbachol were identified. Treatment with carbachol induces muscarinic receptor-dependent rises in free cytosolic Ca(2+). Experiments with calcimycin and nifedipine were carried out to clarify the relationship between these two receptor-triggered events. In particular, it is believed to mediate intracellularly the release of Ca(2+) from non-mitochondrial stores. We also examined cellular impedance responsiveness of PC 12 cells in response to phenotypic alteration especially with regard to modulation of ion fluxes using nerve growth factor (NGF), dexamethasone and forskolin. Our results demonstrate that a change in electrophysiological behavior, such as exocytosis of cytosolic Ca(2+) is detectable using impedance spectroscopy, and therefore support the results of impedance fluctuation to be attributed to ion-fluxes.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jalimarada, Supriya S</author><author>Shivanna, Mahesh</author><author>Kini, Vidisha</author><author>Mehta, Dolly</author><author>Srinivas, Sangly P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microtubule disassembly breaks down the barrier integrity of corneal endothelium.</title><secondary-title>Experimental eye research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental eye research</full-title></periodical><pages>333-343</pages><volume>89</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Corneal</keyword><keyword>Corneal: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Corneal: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Corneal: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microtubules</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nocodazole</keyword><keyword>Nocodazole: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tubulin Modulators</keyword><keyword>Tubulin Modulators: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><accession-num>19345211</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.exer.2009.03.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2745835&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Increased contractility of the peri-junctional actomyosin ring (PAMR) breaks down the barrier integrity of corneal endothelium. This study has examined the effects of microtubule disassembly on Myosin Light Chain (MLC) phosphorylation, a biochemical marker of actomyosin contraction, and barrier integrity in monolayers of cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCEC). Exposure to nocodazole, which readily induced microtubule disassembly, led to disruption of the characteristically dense assembly of cortical actin cytoskeleton at the apical junctional complex (i.e., PAMR) and dispersion of ZO-1 from its normal locus. Nocodazole also led to an increase in phosphorylation of MLC. Concomitant with these changes, nocodazole caused an increase in permeability to HRP and FITC dextran (10 kDa) and a decrease in trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TER). Y-27632 (a Rho kinase inhibitor) and forskolin (known to inhibit activation of RhoA through direct elevation of cAMP) opposed the nocodazole-induced MLC phosphorylation, decrease in TER, and dispersion of ZO-1. Thrombin, which breaks down the barrier integrity of BCEC monolayers, also induced microtubule disassembly and MLC phosphorylation. Pre-treatment with paclitaxel to stabilize microtubules opposed the thrombin effects. These results suggest that microtubule disassembly breaks down the barrier integrity of BCEC through activation of RhoA and subsequent disruption of the PAMR. The thrombin effect also highlights that signaling downstream of GPCRs can also influence the organization of microtubules.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Ablin, Richard J</author><author>Kynaston, Howard G</author><author>Mason, Malcolm D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4, TGaseP) regulates the interaction of prostate cancer and vascular endothelial cells, a potential role for the ROCK pathway.</title><secondary-title>Microvascular research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microvascular research</full-title></periodical><pages>150-157</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Catalytic</keyword><keyword>Catalytic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Catalytic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers: genetics</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transglutaminases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>18983858</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mvr.2008.09.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983858</url><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026286208001465</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4 or TGaseP) is an enzyme that is uniquely expressed in prostate tissues. The function of the TGase, implicated in the cell-matrix, is yet to be fully established. In the present study, we investigated the role of TGase-4 in tumor-endothelial cell interactions, by creating a panel of prostate cancer cell lines that have different expression profiles of human TGase-4. Here, we report that prostate cancer cells PC-3, when over-expressing TGase-4 (PC-3(TGase4exp)) increased their ability to adhere to quiescent and activated (by hepatocyte growth factor) endothelial cells. In contrast, the prostate cancer cell CAHPV-10, which expressed high levels of TGase-4, reduced the adhesiveness to the endothelial cells after TGase-4 expression was knocked down. By using frequency based electric cell impedance sensing, we found that TGase-4 mediated adhesion resulted in a change in impedance at low frequency (400 Hz), indicating a paracellular pathway disruption. The study further showed that expression of TGase-4 rendered the cells to exert regulation of endothelial interaction by bypassing the ROCK pathway. It is therefore concluded, that TGase-4 plays a pivotal role in the interaction between endothelial cells and prostate cancer cells, an action which is independent of the ROCK pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goncalves, Juan Jose</author><author>Govind, Rakesh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid evaluation of biofilm attachment promoters and biofilm growth orientation using a mini-impedimetric device</title><secondary-title>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</full-title></periodical><pages>341-348</pages><volume>143</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>biofilm attachment</keyword><keyword>corresponding author</keyword><keyword>dr juan goncalves</keyword><keyword>electrical impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>first author</keyword><keyword>juan goncalves</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>polyethyleneimine</keyword><keyword>s institution</keyword><keyword>university of cincinnati</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.snb.2009.07.036</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Rapid evaluation of biofilm attachment promoters and biofilm growth orientation using a mini-impedimetric device - Goncalves, Juan Jose; Govind, Rakesh)

We have now demonstrated that S1P induced cortical actin ring formation and redistribution of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin to the cell periphery suggesting the critical role of cell-cell adhesion in endothelial barrier enhancement. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed increased association of VE-cadherin with FAK and paxillin in S1P-challenged human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) monolayers. Furthermore, S1P-induced enhancement of VE-cadherin interaction with alpha-catenin and beta-catenin was associated with the increased formation of FAK-beta-catenin protein complexes. Depletion of beta-catenin (siRNA) resulted in loss of S1P-mediated VE-cadherin association with FAK and paxillin rearrangement. Furthermore, transendothelial electrical resistance (an index of barrier function) demonstrated that beta-catenin siRNA significantly attenuated S1P-induced barrier enhancement. These results demonstrate a mechanism of S1P-induced endothelial barrier enhancement via beta-catenin-linked adherens junction and focal adhesion interaction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oudhoff, Menno J</author><author>Kroeze, Kim L</author><author>Nazmi, Kamran</author><author>van den Keijbus, Petra a M</author><author>van 't Hof, Wim</author><author>Fernandez-borja, Mar</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author><author>Gibbs, Susan</author><author>Bolscher, Jan G M</author><author>Veerman, Enno C I</author><author>Keijbus, Petra A M Van Den</author><author>Hof, Wim Van</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure-activity analysis of histatin, a potent wound healing peptide from human saliva: cyclization of histatin potentiates molar activity 1,000-fold.</title><secondary-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>3928-3935</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation</keyword><keyword>Cell Proliferation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cyclization</keyword><keyword>Drug Synergism</keyword><keyword>Histatins</keyword><keyword>Histatins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes</keyword><keyword>Keratinocytes: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Saliva</keyword><keyword>Saliva: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Structure-Activity Relationship</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: physiology</keyword><keyword>and they have increased</keyword><keyword>antimicrobial peptides</keyword><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>conditions such as mucositis</keyword><keyword>cyclic pep-</keyword><keyword>domain mapping</keyword><keyword>or xerostomia</keyword><keyword>reepithelialization</keyword><keyword>risk for oral</keyword><keyword>these patients suffer from</keyword><keyword>tide</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19652025</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.09-137588</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19652025</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Wounds in the mouth heal faster and with less scarification and inflammation than those in the skin. Saliva is thought to be essential for the superior oral wound healing, but the involved mechanism is still unclear. We have previously discovered that a human-specific peptide, histatin, might be implicated in the wound-healing properties of saliva. Here we report that histatin enhances reepithelialization in a human full-skin wound model closely resembling normal skin. The peptide does not stimulate proliferation but induces cell spreading and migration, two key initiating steps in reepithelialization. Activation of cells by histatin requires a G-protein-coupled receptor that activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Using a stepwise-truncation method, we determined the minimal domain (SHREFPFYGDYGS) of the 38-mer-parent peptide that is required for activity. Strikingly, N- to C-terminal cyclization of histatin-1 potentiates the molar activity approximately 1000-fold, indicating that the recognition of histatin by its cognate receptor requires a specific spatial conformation of the peptide. Our results emphasize the importance of histatin in human saliva for tissue protection and recovery and establish the experimental basis for the development of synthetic histatins as novel skin wound-healing agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Gils, Janine M</author><author>Stutterheim, Janine</author><author>van Duijn, Trynette J</author><author>Zwaginga, Jaap Jan</author><author>Porcelijn, Leendert</author><author>de Haas, Masja</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HPA-1a alloantibodies reduce endothelial cell spreading and monolayer integrity.</title><secondary-title>Molecular immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>406-415</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Antibodies: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Human Platelet</keyword><keyword>Human Platelet: immunology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Integrin beta3</keyword><keyword>Isoantibodies</keyword><keyword>Isoantibodies: immunology</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Cord</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Cord: cytology</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing: drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19038456</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molimm.2008.10.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038456</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Migration;ECIS TEER;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Maternal human platelet antigen (HPA)-1a alloantibodies causing neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia can bind also to endothelium, via the beta3-integrin (CD61). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HPA-1a Abs on endothelial cell function, with emphasis on monolayer integrity. We used a CD61 mAb as a model for the HPA-1a alloantibodies and confirmed the results with purified IgG fractions from HPA-1a alloimmunized women. The effect of these antibodies was examined by monitoring the adhesion, spreading, and monolayer integrity of primary HUVECs with conventional adhesion assays as well as electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing. We found that both the mAb CD61 and the HPA-1a antibodies caused a significant reduction in HUVEC spreading. Moreover, addition of the mAb CD61 and the HPA-1a antibodies prior to or following formation of a stable endothelial monolayer negatively affected endothelial monolayer integrity, which was accompanied by a redistribution of junctional proteins. Our data suggest that HPA-1a alloantibodies have a direct effect on endothelial cell spreading and monolayer integrity, which could contribute to the increased bleeding tendency in children with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Sanders, Andrew J</author><author>Ye, L I N</author><author>Kynaston, Howard G</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor , expression in human prostate cancer tissue and the impact on adhesion and migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro</title><secondary-title>International journal of oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>1473-1480</pages><volume>35</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ijo</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECIS Migration</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Betzen, Christian</author><author>White, Robin</author><author>Zehendner, Christoph M</author><author>Pietrowski, Eweline</author><author>Bender, Bianca</author><author>Luhmann, Heiko J</author><author>Kuhlmann, Christoph R W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oxidative stress upregulates the NMDA receptor on cerebrovascular endothelium.</title><secondary-title>Free radical biology &amp; medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Free radical biology &amp; medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1212-1220</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cerebrovascular Circulation</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Glutamic Acid</keyword><keyword>Glutamic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Immunoenzyme Techniques</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>N-Methyl-D-Aspartate</keyword><keyword>N-Methyl-D-Aspartate: genetics</keyword><keyword>N-Methyl-D-Aspartate: metabolism</keyword><keyword>N-Methylaspartate</keyword><keyword>N-Methylaspartate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Oxidative Stress</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species</keyword><keyword>Reactive Oxygen Species: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>19660541</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.07.034</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19660541</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS Attachment;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-mediated oxidative stress has been implicated in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in a variety of neuropathological diseases. Although some interactions between both phenomena have been elucidated, possible influences of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the NMDA-R itself have so far been neglected. The objective of this study was to examine how the cerebroendothelial NMDA-R is affected by exposure to oxidative stress and to assess possible influences on BBB integrity. RT-PCR confirmed several NMDA-R subunits (NR1, NR2B-D) expressed in the bEnd3 cell line (murine cerebrovascular endothelial cells). NR1 protein expression after exposure to ROS was observed via in-cell Western. The functionality of the expressed NMDA-R was determined by measuring DiBAC fluorescence in ROS-preexposed cells upon stimulation with the specific agonist NMDA. Finally, the effects on barrier integrity were evaluated using the ECIS system to detect changes in monolayer impedance upon NMDA-R stimulation after exposure to ROS. The expression of NR1 significantly (p&lt;0.001) increased 72 h after 30 min exposure to superoxide (+33.8+/-7.5%), peroxynitrite (+84.9+/-10.7%), or hydrogen peroxide (+92.8+/-7.6%), resulting in increased cellular response to NMDA-R stimulation and diminished monolayer impedance. We conclude that oxidative stress upregulates NMDA-R on cerebrovascular endothelium and thus heightens susceptibility to glutamate-induced BBB disruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melnikova, Vladislava O</author><author>Balasubramanian, Krishnakumar</author><author>Villares, Gabriel J</author><author>Dobroff, Andrey S</author><author>Zigler, Maya</author><author>Wang, Hua</author><author>Petersson, Frederik</author><author>Price, Janet E</author><author>Schroit, Alan</author><author>Prieto, Victor G</author><author>Hung, Mien-Chie</author><author>Bar-Eli, Menashe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crosstalk between protease-activated receptor 1 and platelet-activating factor receptor regulates melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/MUC18) expression and melanoma metastasis.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>28845-28855</pages><volume>284</volume><issue>42</issue><keywords><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD146</keyword><keyword>CD146: metabolism</keyword><keyword>CREB-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>CREB-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Silencing</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Melanoma</keyword><keyword>Melanoma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Melanoma: pathology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA Interference</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Skin Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19703903</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M109.042150</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2781430&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>The cellular and molecular pathways that regulate platelet activation, blood coagulation, and inflammation are emerging as critical players in cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate a novel signaling mechanism whereby protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) mediates expression of melanoma cell adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 (MUC18), a critical marker of melanoma metastasis, via activation of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We found that PAR1 silencing with small hairpin RNA inhibits MUC18 expression in metastatic melanoma cells by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation, activity, and binding to the MUC18 promoter. We further demonstrate that the PAF/PAFR pathway mediates MUC18 expression downstream of PAR1. Indeed, PAR1 silencing down-regulates PAFR expression and PAF production, PAFR silencing blocks MUC18 expression, and re-expression of PAFR in PAR1-silenced cells rescues MUC18 expression. We further demonstrate that the PAR1-PAFR-MUC18 pathway mediates melanoma cell adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells, transendothelial migration, and metastatic retention in the lungs. Rescuing PAFR expression in PAR1-silenced cells fully restores metastatic phenotype of melanoma, indicating that PAFR plays critical role in the molecular mechanism of PAR1 action. Our results link the two pro-inflammatory G-protein-coupled receptors, PAR1 and PAFR, with the metastatic dissemination of melanoma and suggest that PAR1, PAFR, and MUC18 are attractive therapeutic targets for preventing melanoma metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fordjour, Akua K</author><author>Harrington, Elizabeth O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PKCdelta influences p190 phosphorylation and activity: events independent of PKCdelta-mediated regulation of endothelial cell stress fiber and focal adhesion formation and barrier function.</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</full-title></periodical><pages>1179-1190</pages><volume>1790</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetophenones</keyword><keyword>Acetophenones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Benzopyrans</keyword><keyword>Benzopyrans: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunoblotting</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C-delta</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C-delta: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C-delta: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C-delta: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Repressor Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><accession-num>19632305</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2759355&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>We have shown that protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) inhibition results in increased endothelial cell (EC) permeability and decreased RhoA activity; which correlated with diminished stress fibers (SF) and focal adhesions (FA).

After incubation for 2h, approximately 68% of inoculated cells adhere to the ALNGR peptide disk. Adhesion inhibition assay with integrin antibodies showed that the ALNGR peptide interacts with integrin beta1 but not with alphavbeta3, indicating that the receptors for ALNGR are different from RGDS. Additionally, the ALNGR peptide expressed cell specificities for adhesion: cell adhesion was promoted for fibroblasts but not for keratinocytes or endotherial cells. The ALNGR peptide induced cell adhesion and promoted cell proliferation without changing its property. It is therefore useful for the construction of functional biomaterials.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Jinfeng</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Zhang, Lijian</author><author>Jiang, Wen G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Placenta growth factor, PLGF, influences the motility of lung cancer cells, the role of Rho associated kinase, Rock1.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>313-320</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Catalytic</keyword><keyword>Catalytic: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lung Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Proteins</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Transgenes</keyword><keyword>Transgenes: genetics</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18615591</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcb.21831</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18615591</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Placenta growth factor (PlGF) is a member of the VEGF family and has been implicated in the aggressive capacity of solid tumours, partly via its impact on angiogenesis. The present study determined the direct biological function of endogenous PlGF in lung cancer cells. From the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 which expressed good level of PlGF, we created sublines within which PlGF expression was knockdown by way of anti-PlGF ribozyme transgenes. Remarkable reductions of both PlGF mRNA and protein by the ribozyme transgenes were revealed in A549 transfectants (A549(DeltaPlGF)) using RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. A549(DeltaPlGF) cells exhibited significantly reduced migration and adhesion compared with the wild-type (A549(WT)) and the empty plasmid control (A549(pEF/His)) cells. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting further revealed that the expression of ROCK1, Rho associated kinase, was also reduced in A549(DeltaPlGF) cells, in comparison with wild-type and control cells. In addition, A549(DeltaPlGF) cells lost its response to a ROCK inhibitor, which otherwise strongly inhibited the motility of A549(WT) and A549(pEF/His) cells. These data indicate that PlGF directly regulates the motility of human lung cancer cells and that this regulation critically dependent on ROCK-1. The study further indicates that PlGF is a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Navdaev, Alexei</author><author>Heitmann, Vanessa</author><author>deSantana Evangelista, Karla</author><author>Mörgelin, Matthias</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Eble, Johannes a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The C-terminus of the γ2 chain but not of the β3 chain of laminin-332 is indirectly but indispensably necessary for integrin-mediated cell reactions</title><secondary-title>Experimental Cell Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Cell Research</full-title></periodical><pages>489-497</pages><volume>314</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.10.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014482707005216</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Argraves, Kelley M</author><author>Gazzolo, Patrick J</author><author>Groh, Eric M</author><author>Wilkerson, Brent a</author><author>Matsuura, Bryan S</author><author>Twal, Waleed O</author><author>Hammad, Samar M</author><author>Argraves, W Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High density lipoprotein-associated sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes endothelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>25074-25081</pages><volume>283</volume><issue>36</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation: physiology</keyword><keyword>HDL</keyword><keyword>HDL: metabolism</keyword><keyword>HDL: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lipoproteins</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: metabolism</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: drug effects</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18606817</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M801214200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2529014&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>High density lipoproteins (HDL) are major plasma carriers of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Here we show that HDL increases endothelial barrier integrity as measured by electric cell substrate impedance sensing. S1P was implicated as the mediator in this process through findings showing that pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi-coupled S1P receptors, as well as antagonists of the S1P receptor, S1P1, inhibited barrier enhancement by HDL. Additional findings show that HDL stimulates endothelial cell activation of Erk1/2 and Akt, signaling pathway intermediates that have been implicated in S1P-dependent endothelial barrier activity. HDL was also found to promote endothelial cell motility, a process that may also relate to endothelial barrier function in the context of a vascular injury response. The effects of HDL on endothelial cell Erk1/2 and Akt activation and motility were suppressed by pertussis toxin and S1P1 antagonists. However, both HDL-induced barrier enhancement and HDL-induced motility showed a greater dependence on Akt activation as compared with Erk1/2 activation. Together, the findings indicate that HDL has endothelial barrier promoting activities, which are attributable to its S1P component and signaling through the S1P1/Akt pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Mingzhang</author><author>Breslin, Jerome W</author><author>Wu, Mack H</author><author>Gottardi, Cara J</author><author>Yuan, Sarah Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VE-cadherin and beta-catenin binding dynamics during histamine-induced endothelial hyperpermeability.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of beta-catenin and VE-cadherin interactions on endothelial permeability during inflammatory stimulation by histamine. We first assessed the ability of a beta-catenin binding polypeptide known as inhibitor of beta-catenin and T cell factor (ICAT) to compete beta-catenin binding to VE-cadherin in vitro. We then overexpressed recombinant FLAG-ICAT in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to study its impact on endothelial barrier function controlled by cell-cell adhesions. The binding of beta-catenin to VE-cadherin was quantified before and after stimulation with histamine along with measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and apparent permeability to albumin (P(a)) under the same conditions. The results showed that ICAT bound to beta-catenin and competitively inhibited binding of the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain to beta-catenin in a concentration-dependent manner. Overexpression of FLAG-ICAT in endothelial cell monolayers did not affect their basal permeability properties, as indicated by unaltered TER and P(a); however, the magnitude and duration of histamine-induced decreases in TER were significantly augmented. Likewise, the increase in P(a) in the presence of histamine was exacerbated. Overexpression of FLAG-ICAT also significantly decreased the level of beta-catenin-associated VE-cadherin following histamine stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that inflammatory agents like histamine cause a transient and reversible disruption of binding between beta-catenin and VE-cadherin, during which endothelial permeability is elevated.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Male, Keith B</author><author>Lachance, Bernard</author><author>Hrapovic, Sabahudin</author><author>Sunahara, Geoff</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of cytotoxicity of quantum dots and gold nanoparticles using cell-based impedance spectroscopy.</title><secondary-title>Analytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>5487-5493</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cadmium</keyword><keyword>Cadmium: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cadmium: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Cell Size: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Gold: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Gold: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Ions</keyword><keyword>Ions: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Metal Nanoparticles: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Quantum Dots</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18553941</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ac8004555</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18553941</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>A continuous online technique based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was demonstrated for measuring the concentration and time response function of fibroblastic V79 cells exposed to nanomaterials such as quantum dots (QDs) and fluorescent gold nanoparticles. The half-inhibition concentration, (ECIS50), the required concentration to attain 50% inhibition of the cytotoxic response, was estimated from the response function to ascertain cytotoxicity during the course of measurement. The ECIS50 values agreed well with the results obtained using the standard neutral red assay. Cadmium selenide quantum dots showed direct cytotoxicity with the ECIS assay. For the cadmium telluride quantum dots, significant toxicity could be assigned to free cadmium, although additional toxicity could be attributed to the QDs per se. The QDs synthesized with indium gallium phosphide and the fluorescent gold nanoparticles were not cytotoxic.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lorenowicz, Magdalena J</author><author>Fernandez-Borja, Mar</author><author>Kooistra, Matthijs R H</author><author>Bos, Johannes L</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PKA and Epac1 regulate endothelial integrity and migration through parallel and independent pathways.</title><secondary-title>European journal of cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European journal of cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>779-792</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Integrins</keyword><keyword>Integrins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Telomere-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18635287</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.05.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635287</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The vascular endothelium provides a semi-permeable barrier, which restricts the passage of fluid, macromolecules and cells to the surrounding tissues. Cyclic AMP promotes endothelial barrier function and protects the endothelium against pro-inflammatory mediators. This study analyzed the relative contribution of two cAMP targets, PKA and Epac1, to the control of endothelial barrier function and endothelial cell migration. Real-time recording of transendothelial electrical resistance showed that activation of either PKA or Epac1 with specific cAMP analogues increases endothelial barrier function and promotes endothelial cell migration. In addition, reduction of Epac1 expression showed that Epac1 and PKA control endothelial integrity and cell motility by two independent and complementary signaling pathways. We demonstrate that integrin-mediated adhesion is required for PKA, but not Epac1-Rap1-driven stimulation of endothelial barrier function. In contrast, both PKA- and Epac1-stimulated endothelial cell migration requires integrin function. These data show that activation of Epac1 and PKA by cAMP results in the stimulation of two parallel, independent signaling pathways that positively regulate endothelial integrity and cell migration, which is important for recovery after endothelial damage and for restoration of compromised endothelial barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rentsendorj, Otgonchimeg</author><author>Mirzapoiazova, Tamara</author><author>Adyshev, Djanybek</author><author>Servinsky, Laura E</author><author>Renné, Thomas</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Pearse, David B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in cGMP-mediated protection of human pulmonary artery endothelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) has been hypothesized to mediate PKG(I) barrier protection because VASP is a cytoskeletal phosphorylation target of PKG(I) expressed in cell-cell junctions. Unphosphorylated VASP was proposed to increase paracellular permeability through actin polymerization and stress fiber bundling, a process inhibited by PKG(I)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser(157) and Ser(239). To test this hypothesis, we examined the role of VASP in the transient barrier dysfunction caused by H(2)O(2) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) monolayers studied without and with PKG(I) expression introduced by adenoviral infection (Ad.PKG). In the absence of PKG(I) expression, H(2)O(2) (100-250 microM) caused a transient increased permeability and pSer(157)-VASP formation that were both attenuated by protein kinase C inhibition. Potentiation of VASP Ser(157) phosphorylation by either phosphatase 2B inhibition with cyclosporin or protein kinase A activation with forskolin prolonged, rather than inhibited, the increased permeability caused by H(2)O(2). With Ad.PKG infection, inhibition of VASP expression with small interfering RNA exacerbated H(2)O(2)-induced barrier dysfunction but had no effect on cGMP-mediated barrier protection. In addition, expression of a Ser-double phosphomimetic mutant VASP failed to reproduce the protective effects of activated PKG(I). Finally, expression of a Ser-double phosphorylation-resistant VASP failed to interfere with the ability of cGMP/PKG(I) to attenuate H(2)O(2)-induced disruption of VE-cadherin homotypic binding. Our results suggest that VASP phosphorylation does not explain the protective effect of cGMP/PKG(I) on H(2)O(2)-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in HPAEC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Wen G</author><author>Martin, Tracey a</author><author>Lewis-Russell, Jonathan M</author><author>Douglas-Jones, Anthony</author><author>Ye, Lin</author><author>Mansel, Robert E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eplin-alpha expression in human breast cancer, the impact on cellular migration and clinical outcome.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>71</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Nude</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18796137</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1476-4598-7-71</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2553413&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>To investigate the expression of EPLIN-alpha, epithelial protein lost in neoplasm, in human breast cancer tissues/cells and investigate the cellular impact of EPLIN-alpha on breast cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balasubramanian, Lavanya</author><author>Yip, Kay-Pong</author><author>Hsu, Tai-Hsin</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of renal vascular smooth muscle cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Changes in measured impedance as a function of frequency were compared with the calculated values obtained from an extended cell-electrode model to estimate the junctional resistance, distance between the ventral cell surface and the substratum, and apical and basolateral membrane capacitances of renal VSMCs. This cell-electrode model was derived to accommodate the slender and rectangular shape of VSMCs. The calculated changes in impedance (Z(cal)) based on the model agreed well with the experimental measurement (Z(exp)), and the percentage error defined as |(Z(cal)-Z(exp))/Z(exp)| was 1.0%. To test the sensitivity of the new model for capturing changes in cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions induced by changes in cellular environment, we then applied this model to analyze impedance changes induced by an integrin binding peptide in renal VSMCs. Our result demonstrates that integrin binding peptide decreases junctional resistance between cells, increases the distance between the basolateral cell surface and substratum, and increases the apical membrane capacitance, whereas the basolateral membrane capacitance stays relatively stable. This model provides a generic approach for impedance analysis of cell layers composed of slender, rectangular cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Male, Keith B</author><author>Rao, Yerra Koteswara</author><author>Tzeng, Yew-Min</author><author>Montes, Johnny</author><author>Kamen, Amine</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Probing inhibitory effects of Antrodia camphorata isolates using insect cell-based impedance spectroscopy: inhibition vs chemical structure.</title><secondary-title>Chemical research in toxicology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical research in toxicology</full-title></periodical><pages>2127-2133</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antrodia</keyword><keyword>Antrodia: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Ergosterol</keyword><keyword>Ergosterol: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Ergosterol: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Ergosterol: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Inhibitory Concentration 50</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis</keyword><keyword>Spodoptera</keyword><keyword>Structure-Activity Relationship</keyword><keyword>Triterpenes</keyword><keyword>Triterpenes: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Triterpenes: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18816072</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/tx800202a</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18816072</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>A continuous online technique based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used for probing inhibitory effects on Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells exposed to structurally similar compounds isolated and purified from the fruiting bodies of the fungus Antrodia camphorata. Such chemicals consisted of three ergostane-related steroids and five lanosta-related triterpenes, which are known for their diverse properties and use in the formulation of nutraceuticals and functional foods. The half-inhibition concentration (ECIS(50)), the level at which 50% inhibition of the resistance response was obtained, was determined from the response function to establish inhibitory effects of the different isolates. A slight change in their chemical structures resulted in significant effects on inhibition as probed by impedance spectroscopy. The ergostane-related steroids were mostly inhibitory, but replacing their ketone groups with hydrogen or hydroxyl groups significantly reduced the inhibition. Similarly, the addition of methyl or carboxymethyl groups also lowered the inhibition. Removal of the double bond conjugation within the rings (sulfurenic acid) of the isolate drastically reduced the inhibition.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nami, Nishikiori</author><author>Makoto, Osanai</author><author>Hideki, Chiba</author><author>Takashi, Kojima</author><author>Yoshinori, Mitamura</author><author>Hiroshi, Ohguro</author><author>Sawada, Norimasa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glial cell-derived cytokines attenuate the breakdown of vascular integrity in diabetic retinopathy</title><secondary-title>Diabetes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetes</full-title></periodical><pages>1333-1340</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0012-1797</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2337/db06-1431.Additional</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is a biological unit comprised of specialized capillary endothelial cells firmly connected by intercellular tight junctions and endotheliumsurrounding glial cells. The BRB is essential for maintaining the retinal microenvironment and low permeability and is compromised in an early phase during the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Here, we demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha stimulants preferentially act on glial cells rather than endothelial cells, resulting in the enhanced expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) through recruitment of the RARalpha-driven trans-acting coactivator to the 5'-flanking region of the gene promoter. Conversely, RARalpha decreases expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor. These gene expression alterations causally limit vascular permeability by modulating the tight junction function of capillary endothelium in a paracrine manner in vitro. The phenotypic transformation of glial cells mediated by RARalpha is sufficient for significant reductions of vascular leakage in the diabetic retina, suggesting that RARalpha antagonizes the loss of tight junction integrity induced by diabetes. These findings reveal that glial cell-derived cytokines such as GDNF and VEGF regulate BRB function, implying that the glial cell can be a possible therapeutic target in diabetic retinopathy. © 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campbell, Carmen Elaine</author><author>Laane, Morten Motzfeldt</author><author>Haugarvoll, Erlend</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring viral-induced cell death using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</title><secondary-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics</full-title></periodical><pages>536-542</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Carps</keyword><keyword>Cell Death</keyword><keyword>Cell Death: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Embryonic Stem Cells</keyword><keyword>Embryonic Stem Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Embryonic Stem Cells: virology</keyword><keyword>Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus</keyword><keyword>Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus: growth &amp;</keyword><keyword>Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus</keyword><keyword>Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus: growth &amp; dev</keyword><keyword>Salmonidae</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17826975</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bios.2007.06.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17826975</url></web-urls></urls><label>Virology</label><abstract>Using an electrical measurement known as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), we have recorded the dynamics of viral infections in cell culture. With this technique, cells are cultured on small gold electrodes where the measured impedance mirrors changes in attachment and morphology of cultured cells. As the cells attach and spread on the electrode, the measured impedance increases until the electrode is completely covered. Viral infection inducing cytopathic effect results in dramatic impedance changes, which are mainly due to cell death. In the current study, two different fish cell lines have been used: chinook salmonid embryonic (CHSE-214) cells infected with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) carp cells infected with infectious hematopoeitic necrosis virus (IHNV). The impedance changes caused by cell response to virus are easily measured and converted to resistance and capacitance. An approximate linear correlation between log of viral titer and time of cell death was determined.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartmann, Christoph</author><author>Zozulya, Alla</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Galla, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of glia-derived extracellular matrices on the barrier function of cerebral endothelial cells: an in vitro study.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>1318-1325</pages><volume>313</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: cytology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface Extensions</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface Extensions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cerebellum: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: physiology</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: secretion</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neuroglia</keyword><keyword>Neuroglia: physiology</keyword><keyword>Neuroglia: secretion</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions</keyword><keyword>Tight Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: secretion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17346702</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.01.024</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17346702</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier</label><abstract>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of the cerebral microvascular endothelium, which, together with astrocytes, pericytes, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), contributes to a &quot;neurovascular unit&quot;. It was our objective to clarify the impact of endogenous extracellular matrices on the barrier function of BBB microvascular endothelial cells cultured in vitro. The study was performed in two consecutive steps: (i) The ECM-donating cells (astrocytes, pericytes, endothelial cells) were grown to confluence and then removed from the growth substrate by a protocol that leaves the ECM behind. (ii) Suspensions of cerebral endothelial cells were seeded on the endogenous matrices and barrier formation was followed with time. In order to quantify the tightness of the cell junctions, all experiments were performed on planar gold-film electrodes that can be used to read the electrical resistance of the cell layers as a direct measure for endothelial barrier function (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, ECIS). We observed that endogenously isolated ECM from both, astrocytes and pericytes, improved the tightness of cerebral endothelial cells significantly compared to ECM that was derived from the endothelial cells themselves as a control. Moreover, when cerebral endothelial cells were grown on extracellular matrices produced by non-brain endothelial cells (aorta), the electrical resistances were markedly reduced. Our observations indicate that glia-derived ECM - as an essential part of the BBB - is required to ensure proper barrier formation of cerebral endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charrier, Laetitia</author><author>Yan, Yutao</author><author>Nguyen, Hang Thi Thu</author><author>Dalmasso, Guillaume</author><author>Laboisse, Christian L</author><author>Gewirtz, Andrew T</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi V</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAM-15/metargidin mediates homotypic aggregation of human T lymphocytes and heterotypic interactions of T lymphocytes with intestinal epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>16948-16958</pages><volume>282</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>ADAM Proteins</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>ADAM Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Caco-2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm: metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: cytology</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides: metabolism</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes</keyword><keyword>T-Lymphocytes: cytology</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17416588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M700158200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416588</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) play an immunoregulatory role in the intestine. This role involves cell-cell interactions with intraepithelial lymphocytes that may also play a role in some enteropathies. The discovery of the RGD motif-containing Protein ADAM-15 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease-15) raises the question of its involvement in these cell-cell interactions. Cell adhesion assays were performed using the Jurkat E6.1 T cell line as a model of T lymphocytes and Caco2-BBE monolayers as a model of intestinal epithelia. Our results show that an anti-ADAM-15 ectodomain antibody inhibited the attachment of Jurkat cells on Caco2-BBE monolayers. Overexpression of ADAM-15 in Caco2-BBE cells enhanced Jurkat cell binding, and overexpression of ADAM-15 in Jurkat cells enhanced their aggregation. Mutagenesis experiments showed that both the mutation of ADAM-15 RGD domain or the deletion of its cytoplasmic tail decreased these cell-cell interactions. Moreover, wound-healing experiments showed that epithelial ADAM-15-mediated Jurkat cell adhesion to Caco2-BBE cells enhances the mechanisms of wound repair. We also found that ADAM-15-mediated aggregation of Jurkat cells increases the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA. These results demonstrate the following: 1) ADAM-15 is involved in heterotypic adhesion of intraepithelial lymphocytes to IEC as well as in homotypic aggregation of T cells; 2) both the RGD motif and the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM-15 are involved for these cell-cell interactions; and 3) ADAM-15-mediated cell-cell interactions are involved in mechanisms of epithelial restitution and production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Altogether these findings point to ADAM-15 as a possible therapeutic target for prevention of inappropriate T cell activation involved in some pathologies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Omori, Kazuyoshi</author><author>Shikata, Yasushi</author><author>Sarai, Kei</author><author>Watanabe, Naomi</author><author>Wada, Jun</author><author>Goda, Noriko</author><author>Kataoka, Noriyuki</author><author>Shikata, Kenichi</author><author>Makino, Hirofumi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Edaravone mimics sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced endothelial barrier enhancement in human microvascular endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Edaravone also induced small GTPase Rac activation and focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Tyr(576)) phosphorylation associated with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P(1)) transactivation. S1P(1) protein depletion by the short interfering RNA technique completely abolished edaravone-induced FAK (Tyr(576)) phosphorylation and Rac activation. This is the first report of edaravone-induced endothelial barrier enhancement coincident with focal adhesion remodeling and cytoskeletal rearrangement associated with Rac activation via S1P(1) transactivation. Considering the well-established endothelial barrier-protective effect of S1P, endothelial barrier enhancement as a consequence of S1P(1) transactivation may at least partly be the potent mechanisms for the organ-protective effect of edaravone and is suggestive of edaravone as a therapeutic agent against systemic vascular barrier disorder.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Litkouhi, Babak</author><author>Kwong, Joseph</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Smedley, James G</author><author>McClane, Bruce a.</author><author>Aponte, Margarita</author><author>Gao, Zhijian</author><author>Sarno, Jennifer L</author><author>Hinners, Jennifer</author><author>Welch, William R</author><author>Berkowitz, Ross S</author><author>Mok, Samuel C</author><author>Garner, Elizabeth I O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Claudin-4 Overexpression in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Is Associated with Hypomethylation and Is a Potential Target for Modulation of Tight Junction Barrier Function Using a C-Terminal Fragment of Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin</title><secondary-title>Neoplasia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neoplasia</full-title></periodical><pages>304-314</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>claudin-4</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>methylation</keyword><keyword>ovarian cancer</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1593/neo.07118</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=1522-8002&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=304</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Mei</author><author>Waters, Chris L</author><author>Hu, Chuan</author><author>Wysolmerski, Robert B</author><author>Vincent, Peter a</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate rapidly increases endothelial barrier function independently of VE-cadherin but requires cell spreading and Rho kinase.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Since VE-cadherin contributes to the stabilization of the endothelial barrier, we determined whether the rapid, barrier-enhancing activity of S1P requires VE-cadherin. Ca(2+)-dependent, homophilic VE-cadherin binding of endothelial cells, derived from human umbilical veins and grown as monolayers, was disrupted with EGTA, an antibody to the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin, or gene silencing of VE-cadherin with small interfering RNA. All three protocols caused a reduction in the immunofluorescent localization of VE-cadherin at intercellular junctions, the separation of adjacent cells, and a decrease in basal endothelial electrical resistance. In all three conditions, S1P rapidly increased endothelial electrical resistance. These findings demonstrate that S1P enhances the endothelial barrier independently of homophilic VE-cadherin binding. Junctional localization of VE-cadherin, however, was associated with the sustained activity of S1P. Imaging with phase-contrast and differential interference contrast optics revealed that S1P induced cell spreading and closure of intercellular gaps. Pretreatment with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, or Y-27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor, attenuated cell spreading and the rapid increase in electrical resistance induced by S1P. We conclude that S1P rapidly closes intercellular gaps, resulting in an increased electrical resistance across endothelial cell monolayers, via cell spreading and Rho kinase and independently of VE-cadherin.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saxena, Neeraj K</author><author>Sharma, Dipali</author><author>Ding, Xiaokun</author><author>Lin, Songbai</author><author>Marra, Fabio</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author><author>Anania, Frank a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Concomitant activation of the JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and ERK signaling is involved in leptin-mediated promotion of invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>2497-2507</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Growth Processes</keyword><keyword>Cell Growth Processes: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: metabo</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Hepatocellular: pathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Janus Kinases</keyword><keyword>Janus Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leptin</keyword><keyword>Leptin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Liver Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Signaling System: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>STAT3 Transcription Factor</keyword><keyword>STAT3 Transcription Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17363567</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3075</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2925446&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion;ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Various epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Leptin, the key player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight control, also acts as a growth factor on certain organs in both normal and disease states. It is plausible that leptin acts to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis directly affecting malignant properties of liver cancer cells. However, a direct role for leptin in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been shown. In this study, we analyzed the role of leptin and the mechanism(s) underlying its action in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which express both short and long isoforms of leptin receptors. Treatment with leptin resulted in increased proliferation of both HepG2 and Huh7 cells and involves activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. Leptin-induced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was dependent on Janus-activated kinase (JAK)/STAT activation. Intriguingly, we also found that leptin potently induces invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in Matrigel invasion and electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing assays. Leptin-stimulated invasion was effectively blocked by pharmacologic inhibitors of JAK/STAT and, to a lesser extent, by ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition. Importantly, leptin also induced the migration of both HepG2 and Huh7 cells on fibronectin matrix. Inhibition of JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K activation using pharmacologic inhibitors effectively blocked leptin-induced migration of HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that leptin promotes hepatocellular carcinoma growth, invasiveness, and migration and implicate the JAK/STAT pathway as a critical mediator of leptin action. Our findings have potential clinical implications for hepatocellular carcinoma progression in obese patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hadjout, Nacima</author><author>Yin, Xiuyun</author><author>Knecht, David a</author><author>Lynes, Michael a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated real-time measurements of leukocyte chemotaxis.</title><secondary-title>Journal of immunological methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of immunological methods</full-title></periodical><pages>70-80</pages><volume>320</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Marrow Cells</keyword><keyword>Bone Marrow Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Bone Marrow Cells: immunology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Complement C5a</keyword><keyword>Complement C5a: immunology</keyword><keyword>Complement C5a: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: immunology</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17275834</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jim.2006.12.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1934897&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We have previously described an automated system (ECIS/taxis) for measuring chemotactic movement of Dictyostelium amoebae in a folic acid gradient [Hadjout, N., Laevsky, G., Knecht, D.A. and Lynes, M.A., 2001. Automated real-time measurement of chemotactic cell motility. Biotechniques 31, 1130-1138.]. In the ECIS/taxis system, cells migrate in an under-agarose environment, and their position is monitored by determining the impedance change caused by cells crawling onto the surface of an electrode. In this report, we show that chemotaxis of primary and immortalized leukocytes in response to complement (C5a) could be measured using the ECIS/taxis system. Several modifications to the design of the target electrode were tested, and a linear electrode perpendicular to the direction of movement was found to increase the sensitivity and reliability of the assay. Using the optimized ECIS/taxis assay, the dose response of neutrophils and WBC 265-9C cells was established and compared to the Boyden chamber assay. The ECIS/taxis assay system can be used to compare the movement of different cell types, to assess the effect of complex chemotactic gradients, or to determine the effects of pharmaceuticals on chemotactic motility.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiang, Eddie T</author><author>Persaud-Sawin, Dixie-Ann</author><author>Kulkarni, Sandhya</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Imani, Farhad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bluetongue virus and double-stranded RNA increase human vascular permeability: role of p38 MAPK.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>406-416</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bluetongue virus</keyword><keyword>Bluetongue virus: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Cytokines: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Double-Stranded</keyword><keyword>Double-Stranded: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Hemorrhagic Fevers</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lung: virology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: pathology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: virology</keyword><keyword>Viral</keyword><keyword>Viral: etiology</keyword><keyword>Viral: pathology</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1087500690244</isbn><accession-num>16786433</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10875-006-9024-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16786433</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction;TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Endothelial cell (EC) involvement in viral hemorrhagic fevers has been clearly established. However, virally activated mechanisms leading to endothelial activation and dysfunction are not well understood. Several different potential mechanisms such as direct viral infection, alterations in procoagulant/anticoagulant balance, and increased cytokine production have been suggested. We utilized a model of EC barrier dysfunction and vascular endothelial leakage to explore the effect of bluetongue virus (BTV), a hemorrhagic fever virus of ruminants, on human lung endothelial cell barrier properties. Infection of human lung EC with BTV induced a significant and dose-dependent decrease in trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, decreases in TER occurred in conjunction with cytoskeletal rearrangement, suggesting a direct mechanism for viral infection-mediated endothelial barrier disruption. Interestingly, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mimicked the effects of BTV on endothelial barrier properties. Both BTV- and dsRNA-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction was blocked by treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK. The induction of vascular permeability by dsRNA treatment or BTV infection was concomitent with induction of inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, our data suggest that the presence of dsRNA during viral infections and subsequent activation of p38 MAPK is a potential molecular pathway for viral induction of hemorrhagic fevers. Collectively, our data suggest that inhibition of p38 MAPK may be a possible therapeutic approach to alter viral-induced acute hemorrhagic diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>AAS, VIGDIS</author><author>TORBLÅ, SIRI</author><author>ANDERSEN, MERETHE H</author><author>JENSEN, JØRGEN</author><author>RUSTAN, ARILD C H R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical Stimulation Improves Insulin Responses in a Human Skeletal Muscle Cell Model of Hyperglycemia</title><secondary-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>506-515</pages><volume>967</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>2-deoxyglucose uptake</keyword><keyword>electrical stimulation</keyword><keyword>hyperglycemia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04309.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04309.x</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>Myoblasts from human skeletal muscle were isolated from needle biopsy samples of the vastus lateralis of young and healthy volunteers. Contaminating fibroblasts were removed, and myoblasts were fused into differentiated multinucleated myotubes. These myotubes manifested both basal and insulin-stimulated (1-100 nM) glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Insulin increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 1.4-fold and glycogen synthesis by 2.1-fold. Measurements of impedance of cell-covered gold electrodes (ECIS system) showed increased micromotion of caffeine-stimulated cells, showing their ability to contract. Acute electrical stimulation of the myotubes increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by about 30%. Treatment with high glucose concentrations (10-20 mM) for 2-8 days reduced both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Maximal effect was seen after 2 days of treatment with 20 mM glucose. Baseline glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis were reduced by 35%, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 25%, and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis by 39%. Total cell content of glycogen was not changed by hyperglycemia. The insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hyperglycemia-treated cells was improved by electrical stimulation of the cells. In conclusion, a model of hyperglycemia has been established, and electrical stimulation improved insulin responses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Adyshev, Djanybek</author><author>Gorshkov, Boris</author><author>Bokoch, Gary M</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GEF-H1 is involved in agonist-induced human pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We have recently shown that the edemagenic agonist thrombin caused partial MT disassembly, which was linked to activation of small GTPase Rho, Rho-mediated actin remodeling, cell contraction, and dysfunction of lung EC barrier. GEF-H1 is an MT-associated Rho-specific guanosine nucleotide (GDP/GTP) exchange factor, which in MT-unbound state stimulates Rho activity. In this study we tested hypothesis that GEF-H1 may be a key molecule involved in Rho activation, myosin light chain phosphorylation, actin remodeling, and EC barrier dysfunction associated with partial MT disassembly. Our results show that depletion of GEF-H1 or expression of dominant negative GEF-H1 mutant significantly attenuated permeability increase, actin stress fiber formation, and increased MLC and MYPT1 phosphorylation induced by thrombin or MT-depolymerizing agent nocodazole. In contrast, expression of wild-type or activated GEF-H1 mutants dramatically enhanced thrombin and nocodazole effects on stress fiber formation and cell retraction. These results show a critical role for the GEF-H1 in the Rho activation caused by MT disassembly and suggest GEF-H1 as a key molecule involved in cross talk between MT and actin cytoskeleton in agonist-induced Rho-dependent EC barrier regulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sapper, Angelika</author><author>Reiss, Björn</author><author>Janshoff, Andreas</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adsorption and fluctuations of giant liposomes studied by electrochemical impedance measurements.</title><secondary-title>Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids</full-title></periodical><pages>676-680</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adsorption</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biocompatible</keyword><keyword>Biocompatible: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Coated Materials</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Gold: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Liposomes</keyword><keyword>Liposomes: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Materials Testing</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo Method</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis</keyword><keyword>Surface Properties</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16401116</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/la051344b</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16401116</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>The present study describes a novel approach based on electrochemical impedance measurements to follow the adsorption of giant liposomes on protein-coated solid surfaces with a time resolution in the order of seconds.

In the vascular endothelium, LPC increases permeability and expression of proinflammatory molecules such as adhesion molecules and cytokines. Yet, mechanisms by which LPC mediates these activities remain unclear and controversial. Recent evidence implicates involvement of a novel subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPR4, G2A, OGR1, and TDAG8) that are sensitive to lysolipids and protons. We previously reported that one of these receptors, GPR4, is selectively expressed by a variety of endothelial cells and therefore hypothesize that the LPC-stimulated endothelial barrier dysfunction is mediated through GPR4. We developed a peptide Ab against GPR4 that detected GPR4 expression in transfected COS 7 cells and endogenous GPR4 expression in endothelial cells by Western blot. Endothelial cells infected with a retrovirus containing small interference RNA (siRNA) to GPR4 resulted in 40-50% decreased GPR4 expression, which corresponded with partial prevention of the LPC-induced 1) decrease in transendothelial resistance, 2) stress fiber formation, and 3) activation of RhoA. Furthermore, coexpression of the siRNA-GPR4 with a siRNA-resistant mutant GPR4 fully restored the LPC-induced resistance decrease. However, extracellular pH of &lt;7.4 did not alter baseline or LPC-stimulated resistances. The results provide strong evidence that the LPC-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction is regulated by endogenous GPR4 in endothelial cells and suggest that GPR4 may play a critical role in the inflammatory responses activated by LPC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berdyshev, Evgeny V</author><author>Gorshkova, Irina a</author><author>Usatyuk, Peter</author><author>Zhao, Yutong</author><author>Saatian, Bahman</author><author>Hubbard, Walter</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>De novo biosynthesis of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinase 1 in mammalian cells.</title><secondary-title>Cellular signalling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cellular signalling</full-title></periodical><pages>1779-1792</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Avian Sarcoma Viruses</keyword><keyword>Avian Sarcoma Viruses: physiology</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: analysis</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)</keyword><keyword>Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor): meta</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase</keyword><keyword>Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: analysis</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Sphingosine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation: genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16529909</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.01.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16529909</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is one of the two known kinases, which generates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent endogenous lipid mediator involved in cell survival, proliferation, and cell-cell interactions. Activation of SK1 and intracellular generation of S1P were suggested to be part of the growth and survival factor-induced signaling, and overexpression of SK1 provoked cell tumorigenic transformation. Using a highly selective and sensitive LC-MS/MS approach, here we show that SK1 overexpression, but not SK2, in different primary cells and cultured cell lines results in predominant upregulation of the synthesis of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (DHS1P) compared to S1P. Stable isotope pulse-labeling experiments in conjunction with LC-MS/MS quantitation of different sphingolipids demonstrated strong interference of overexpressed SK1 with the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis by deviating metabolic flow of newly formed sphingoid bases from ceramide formation toward the synthesis of DHS1P. On the contrary, S1P biosynthesis was not directly linked to the de novo sphingoid bases transformations and was dependent on catabolic generation of sphingosine from complex sphingolipids. As a result of SK1 overexpression, migration and Ca2+-response of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) to stimulation with external S1P, but not thrombin, was strongly impaired. In contrast, selective increase in intracellular content of DHS1P or S1P through the uptake and phosphorylation of corresponding sphingoid bases had no effect on S1P-induced signaling or facilitation of wound healing. Furthermore, infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) with RSV A-2 virus increased SK1-mediated synthesis of DHS1P and S1P, whereas TNF-alpha enhanced only S1P production in HPAEC. These findings uncover a new functional role for SK1, which can control survival/death (DHS1P-S1P/ceramides) balance by targeting sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis and selectively generating DHS1P at a metabolic step preceding ceramide formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moldobaeva, Aigul</author><author>Welsh-Servinsky, Laura E</author><author>Shimoda, Larissa a</author><author>Stephens, R Scott</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Tuder, Rubin M</author><author>Pearse, David B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of protein kinase G in barrier-protective effects of cGMP in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

To determine the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)(I), human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) lacking PKG(I) expression were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding PKG(Ibeta) (Ad.PKG) and compared with uninfected and control-infected (Ad.betagal) HPAEC. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), an index of permeability, was measured after H(2)O(2) (250 microM) exposure with or without pretreatment with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cGMP). HPAEC infected with Ad.PKG, but not Ad.betagal, expressed PKG(I) protein and demonstrated Ser(239) and Ser(157) phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein after treatment with CPT-cGMP. Adenoviral infection decreased basal permeability equally in Ad.PKG- and Ad.betagal-infected HPAEC compared with uninfected cells. Treatment with CPT-cGMP (100 microM) caused a PKG(I)-independent decrease in permeability (8.2 +/- 0.6%). In all three groups, H(2)O(2) (250 microM) caused a similar approximately 35% increase in permeability associated with increased actin stress fiber formation, intercellular gaps, loss of membrane VE-cadherin, and increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). In uninfected and Ad.betagal-infected HPAEC, pretreatment with CPT-cGMP (100 microM) partially blocked the increased permeability induced by H(2)O(2). In Ad.PKG-infected HPAEC, CPT-cGMP (50 microM) prevented the H(2)O(2)-induced TER decrease, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and loss of junctional VE-cadherin. CPT-cGMP attenuated the peak [Ca(2+)](i) caused by H(2)O(2) similarly (23%) in Ad.betagal- and Ad.PKG-infected HPAEC, indicating a PKG(I)-independent effect. These data suggest that cGMP decreased HPAEC basal permeability by a PKG(I)-independent process, whereas the ability of cGMP to prevent H(2)O(2)-induced barrier dysfunction was predominantly mediated by PKG(I) through a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ren, Juan</author><author>Xiao, Yi-jin</author><author>Singh, Lisam Shanjukumar</author><author>Zhao, Xiaoxian</author><author>Zhao, Zhenwen</author><author>Feng, Li</author><author>Rose, Tyler M</author><author>Prestwich, Glenn D</author><author>Xu, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lysophosphatidic acid is constitutively produced by human peritoneal mesothelial cells and enhances adhesion, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>3006-3014</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Arachidonic Acids</keyword><keyword>Arachidonic Acids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type I</keyword><keyword>Conditioned</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cytosol</keyword><keyword>Cytosol: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Epithelium: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Epithelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases: metabo</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Group VI Phospholipases A2</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids: physiology</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Peritoneal Cavity</keyword><keyword>Peritoneal Cavity: pathology</keyword><keyword>Peritoneum</keyword><keyword>Peritoneum: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Peritoneum: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phospholipases A</keyword><keyword>Phospholipases A: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Phospholipases A: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pyrones</keyword><keyword>Pyrones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16540649</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1292</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16540649</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is both a potential marker and a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. It is critical to identify the sources of elevated LPA levels in ascites and blood of patients with ovarian cancer. We show here that human peritoneal mesothelial cells constitutively produce LPA, which accounts for a significant portion of the chemotactic activity of the conditioned medium from peritoneal mesothelial cells to ovarian cancer cells. Both production of LPA by peritoneal mesothelial cells and the chemotactic activity in the conditioned medium can be blocked by HELSS [an inhibitor of the calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2))] and AACOCF(3) [an inhibitor of both cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) and iPLA(2)]. Moreover, cell-based enzymatic activity assays for PLA(2) indicate that peritoneal mesothelial cells have strong constitutive PLA(2) activity. Receptors for LPA, LPA(2), and LPA(3) are involved in the conditioned medium-induced chemotactic activity. Invasion of ovarian cancer cells into peritoneal mesothelial cells has also been analyzed and shown to require PLA(2), LPA receptors, and the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. Thus, we show here, for the first time, that human peritoneal mesothelial cells constitutively produce bioactive lipid signaling molecules, such as LPA, via iPLA(2) and/or cPLA(2) activities. Conditioned medium from peritoneal mesothelial cells stimulate migration, adhesion, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and may play similar roles in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Urdapilleta, E</author><author>Bellotti, M</author><author>Bonetto, F J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of cultured cells: A mean-field electrical response model for electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technique</title><secondary-title>Physical Review E</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physical Review E</full-title></periodical><pages>41908</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1103/PhysRevE.74.041908</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.041908</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riethmüller, C</author><author>Jungmann, P</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Oberleithner, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bradykinin shifts endothelial fluid passage from para- to transcellular routes.</title><secondary-title>Pflügers Archiv : European journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pflügers Archiv : European journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>157-165</pages><volume>453</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Body Fluid Compartments</keyword><keyword>Body Fluid Compartments: physiology</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin</keyword><keyword>Bradykinin: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dextrans</keyword><keyword>Dextrans: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Exocytosis</keyword><keyword>Exocytosis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>17047985</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00424-006-0121-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17047985</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>The signalling peptide bradykinin (BK) is implicated in inflammation and angiogenesis. It promotes fluid transport from blood vessels to interstitial space, and thus facilitates oedema formation. To clarify whether paracellular or transcellular pathways mediate this effect, we investigated the BK-stimulated fluid transport across endothelial monolayers in vitro by comparison of electrical and fluorescence methods. Electrical cell impedance sensing monitored a biphasic response of cell layers to BK with high time resolution: a short decrease (18%, 1 min) was followed by a more sustained increase in paracellular resistance (30%, 10 min). The two phases can be assigned to second messengers of the BK-signalling pathway: Ca(2+) for the decrease and cyclic adenosine monophosphate for the rise of resistance, respectively. Despite tightening of the intercellular clefts, BK increased the fluid permeability by 39%, indicating transcellular fluid transport. Additionally, BK stimulated both in- and outwardly directed membrane trafficking as assessed by vesicular fluid uptake (by 49%) and secretion of von Willebrandt factor (by 85%). In conclusion, the combination of electrical and fluorescence data suggests that BK induces a shift from para- to transcellular fluid transport across endothelium.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Driss, Adel</author><author>Charrier, Laetitia</author><author>Yan, Yutao</author><author>Nduati, Vivienne</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dystroglycan receptor is involved in integrin activation in intestinal epithelia.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

The DG complex coprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin, suggesting a possible interaction among these proteins. In addition, we observed that activation of DG receptors by laminin-1 enhanced the interaction between beta(1)-integrin and laminin-1, whereas activation of DG receptors by laminin-2 reduced the interaction between beta(1)-integrin and laminin-2. Finally, we demonstrated that the intracellular COOH-terminal tail of beta-DG and its binding to the DG binding domain of utrophin are crucial for the interactions between laminin-1/-2 and beta(1)-integrin.

It is generally accepted that localized GTPase activation is required for the proper initiation of downstream signaling events, although the molecular mechanisms that control targeting of Rho GTPases are unknown. In this study, we show that the Rho GTPase Rac1, via a proline stretch in its COOH terminus, binds directly to the SH3 domain of the Cdc42/Rac activator beta-Pix (p21-activated kinase [Pak]-interacting exchange factor). The interaction with beta-Pix is nucleotide independent and is necessary and sufficient for Rac1 recruitment to membrane ruffles and to focal adhesions. In addition, the Rac1-beta-Pix interaction is required for Rac1 activation by beta-Pix as well as for Rac1-mediated spreading. Finally, using cells deficient for the beta-Pix-binding kinase Pak1, we show that Pak1 regulates the Rac1-beta-Pix interaction and controls cell spreading and adhesion-induced Rac1 activation. These data provide a model for the intracellular targeting and localized activation of Rac1 through its exchange factor beta-Pix.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charrier, Laetitia</author><author>Yan, Yutao</author><author>Driss, Adel</author><author>Laboisse, Christian L</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi V</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADAM-15 inhibits wound healing in human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

The expression and/or the pathophysiological implications of ADAMs are not known in intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the expression and the role of ADAMs in intestinal epithelial cells. Expression of ADAMs was assessed by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunufluorescence experiments. Wound-healing experiments were performed by using the electric cell substrate impedence sensing technology. Our results showed that ADAMs-10, -12, and -15 mRNA are expressed in the colonic human cell lines Caco2-BBE and HT29-Cl.19A. An ADAM-15 complementary DNA cloned from Caco2-BBE poly(A)+ RNA, and encompassing the entire coding region, was found to be shorter and to present a different region encoding the cytoplasmic tail compared with ADAM-15 sequence deposited in the database. In Caco2-BBE cells and colonic epithelial cells, ADAM-15 protein was found in the apical, basolateral, and intracellular compartments. We also showed that the overexpression of ADAM-15 reduced cell migration in a wound-healing assay in Caco2-BBE monolayers. Our data show that 1) ADAM-15 is expressed in human intestinal epithelia, 2) a new variant of ADAM-15 is expressed in a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and 3) ADAM-15 is involved in intestinal epithelial cells wound-healing processes. Together, these results suggest that ADAM-15 may have important pathophysiological roles in intestinal cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLaughlin, Joseph N</author><author>Shen, Lixin</author><author>Holinstat, Michael</author><author>Brooks, Joshua D</author><author>Dibenedetto, Emmanuele</author><author>Hamm, Heidi E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional selectivity of G protein signaling by agonist peptides and thrombin for the protease-activated receptor-1.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>25048-25059</pages><volume>280</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Amides</keyword><keyword>Amides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chelating Agents</keyword><keyword>Chelating Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dipeptides</keyword><keyword>Dipeptides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Egtazic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>G12-G13</keyword><keyword>G12-G13: metab</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gq-G11</keyword><keyword>Gq-G11: metabo</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Ligands</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinases</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinases: antagonists &amp; inhibitor</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: chemistry</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: physiology</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Peptides: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protease Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protease Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: antagonists &amp; in</keyword><keyword>Pyridines</keyword><keyword>Pyridines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15878870</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M414090200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15878870</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Thrombin activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by cleavage of the amino terminus to unmask a tethered ligand. Although peptide analogs can activate PAR-1, we show that the functional responses mediated via PAR-1 differ between the agonists. Thrombin caused endothelial monolayer permeability and mobilized intracellular calcium with EC(50) values of 0.1 and 1.7 nm, respectively. The opposite order of activation was observed for agonist peptide (SFLLRN-CONH(2) or TFLLRNKPDK) activation. The addition of inactivated thrombin did not affect agonist peptide signaling, suggesting that the differences in activation mechanisms are intramolecular in origin. Although activation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 by agonist peptides induced calcium mobilization, only PAR-1 activation affected barrier function. Induced barrier permeability is likely to be Galpha(12/13)-mediated as chelation of Galpha(q)-mediated intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM, pertussis toxin inhibition of Galpha(i/o), or GM6001 inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase had no effect, whereas Y-27632 inhibition of the Galpha(12/13)-mediated Rho kinase abrogated the response. Similarly, calcium mobilization is Galpha(q)-mediated and independent of Galpha(i/o) and Galpha(12/13) because pertussis toxin Y-27632 and had no effect, whereas U-73122 inhibition of phospholipase C-beta blocked the response. It is therefore likely that changes in permeability reflect Galpha(12/13) activation, and changes in calcium reflect Galpha(q) activation, implying that the pharmacological differences between agonists are likely caused by the ability of the receptor to activate Galpha(12/13) or Galpha(q). This functional selectivity was characterized quantitatively by a mathematical model describing each step leading to Rho activation and/or calcium mobilization. This model provides an estimate that peptide activation alters receptor/G protein binding to favor Galpha(q) activation over Galpha(12/13) by approximately 800-fold.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singleton, Patrick a</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced endothelial cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier enhancement by S1P1 receptor, PI3 kinase, Tiam1/Rac1, and alpha-actinin.</title><secondary-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1646-1656</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Actinin</keyword><keyword>Actinin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Actinin: physiology</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Catalytic Domain</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol</keyword><keyword>Cholesterol: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Chromones</keyword><keyword>Chromones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Enzymologic</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoblotting</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: physiology</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Morpholines</keyword><keyword>Morpholines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Protein Isoforms</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: pathology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: pathology</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16195373</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.05-3928com</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16195373</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Inflammation;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction results in increased vascular permeability observed in inflammation, tumor angiogenesis, and atherosclerosis. The platelet-derived phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) decreases EC permeability in vitro and in vivo and thus has obvious therapeutic potential. We examined S1P-mediated human pulmonary artery EC signaling and barrier regulation in caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM). Immunoblotting from S1P-treated EC revealed S1P-mediated rapid recruitment (1 microM, 5 min) to CEMs of the S1P receptors S1P1 and S1P3, p110 PI3 kinase alpha and beta catalytic subunits, the Rac1 GEF, Tiam1, and alpha-actinin isoforms 1 and 4. Immunoprecipitated p110 PI3 kinase catalytic subunits from S1P-treated EC exhibited PIP3 production in CEMs. Immunoprecipitation of S1P receptors from CEM fractions revealed complexes containing Tiam1 and S1P1. PI3 kinase inhibition (LY294002) attenuated S1P-induced Tiam1 association with S1P1, Tiam1/Rac1 activation, alpha-actinin-1/4 recruitment, and EC barrier enhancement. Silencing of either S1P1 or Tiam1 expression resulted in the loss of S1P-mediated Rac1 activation and alpha-actinin-1/4 recruitment to CEM. Finally, silencing S1P1, Tiam1, or both alpha-actinin isoforms 1/4 inhibits S1P-induced cortical F-actin rearrangement and S1P-mediated barrier enhancement. Taken together, these results suggest that S1P-induced recruitment of S1P1 to CEM fractions promotes PI3 kinase-mediated Tiam1/Rac1 activation required for alpha-actinin-1/4-regulated cortical actin rearrangement and EC barrier enhancement.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goda, Noriko</author><author>Kataoka, Noriyuki</author><author>Shimizu, Juichiro</author><author>Mohri, Satoshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation Of Micromotion Of Vascular Endothelial Cells In Electrical Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing ( Ecis ) Method Using A Mathematical Model.</title><secondary-title>J.

Accumulating evidence indicates that caveolae encapsulating caveolins is the location for those interactions. We found in cultured human keratinocytes that UV irradiation induced both caveolin-1 and EGFR phosphorylation. Filipin, a caveolae disruptive agent, inhibited UV-induced caveolin-1 activation. Na+-K+-ATPase catalyzes active transport of Na+ and K+ across plasma membrane of mammalian cells, inactivation of which has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways including MAP kinase cascade. We found in this study that UV inactivated Na+-K+-ATPase in time-dependent manner, Na+-K+-ATPase activity started to decrease 5 min post UV irradiation and reduced to 60% of its original activity within 1 h. Pretreatment with Flipin and MMP inhibitor recovered Na+-K+-ATPase activity lost by UV irradiation. ECIS analysis indicated that both EGF treatment and UV irradiation increased membrane electric activity which was inhibited by MMP inhibitor and Filipin. Further study showed that pretreatment of human keratinocytes with MMP inhibitor or Filipin inhibited UV-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, which was however not observed in LnCap cells, a prostate cancer cell line lacking caveolin-1. UV irradiation also induced ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF in a time-dependent manner in keratinocytes. Collectively, we conclude that UV-induced MAP kinase activation is mediated by cell surface receptor activation due to the matrix activity and membrane caveolae function and inactivation of Na+-K+-ATPase.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shikata, Yasushi</author><author>Rios, Alexander</author><author>Kawkitinarong, Kamon</author><author>DePaola, Natacha</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential effects of shear stress and cyclic stretch on focal adhesion remodeling, site-specific FAK phosphorylation, and small GTPases in human lung endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>40-49</pages><volume>304</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptor Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Elasticity</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>GTPase-Activating Proteins</keyword><keyword>GTPase-Activating Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Lung: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Mechanical</keyword><keyword>Paxillin</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transducing</keyword><keyword>Stress</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15707572</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.11.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15707572</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Flow;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Regulation of endothelial cell (EC) permeability by bioactive molecules is associated with specific patterns of cytoskeletal and cell contact remodeling. A role for mechanical factors such as shear stress (SS) and cyclic stretch (CS) in cytoskeletal rearrangements and regulation of EC permeability becomes increasingly recognized. This paper examined redistribution of focal adhesion (FA) proteins, site-specific focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, small GTPase activation and barrier regulation in human pulmonary EC exposed to laminar shear stress (15 dyn/cm2) or cyclic stretch (18% elongation) in vitro. SS caused peripheral accumulation of FAs, whereas CS induced randomly distributed FAs attached to the ends of newly formed stress fibers. SS activated small GTPase Rac without effects on Rho, whereas 18% CS activated without effect on Rac. SS increased transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) in EC monolayers, which was further elevated by barrier-protective phospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate. Finally, SS induced FAK phosphorylation at Y576, whereas CS induced FAK phosphorylation at Y397 and Y576. These results demonstrate for the first time differential effects of SS and CS on Rho and Rac activation, FA redistribution, site-specific FAK phosphorylation, and link them with SS-mediated barrier enhancement. Thus, our results suggest common signaling and cytoskeletal mechanisms shared by mechanical and chemical factors involved in EC barrier regulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Becker, Patrice M</author><author>Waltenberger, Johannes</author><author>Yachechko, Robin</author><author>Mirzapoiazova, Tamara</author><author>Sham, James S K</author><author>Lee, Chun Geun</author><author>Elias, Jack a</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neuropilin-1 regulates vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated endothelial permeability.</title><secondary-title>Circulation research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation research</full-title></periodical><pages>1257-1265</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Adult: etiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Lung: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3: physiology</keyword><keyword>Neuropilin-1</keyword><keyword>Neuropilin-1: physiology</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Distress Syndrome</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2: phy</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15920019</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/01.RES.0000171756.13554.49</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15920019</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) is a cell surface receptor that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent mediator of endothelial permeability, chemotaxis, and proliferation. In vitro, Npn-1 can complex with VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) to enhance VEGFR2-mediated endothelial cell chemotaxis and proliferation. To determine the role of Npn-1/VEGFR2 complexes in VEGF-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, endothelial cells were stably transfected with Npn1 or VEGFR2 alone (PAE/Npn and PAE/KDR, respectively), or VEGFR2 and Npn-1 (PAE/KDR/Npn-1). Permeability, estimated by measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), of PAE/Npn and PAE/KDR cell lines was not altered by VEGF165. In contrast, TER of PAE/KDR/Npn-1 cells decreased in dose-dependent fashion following VEGF165 (10 to 200 ng/mL). Activation of VEGFR2, and 2 downstream signaling intermediates (p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK) involved in VEGF-mediated permeability, also increased in PAE/KDR/Npn-1. Consistent with these data, inhibition of Npn-1, but not VEGFR2, attenuated VEGF165-mediated permeability of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAE), and VEGF121 (which cannot ligate Npn-1) did not alter TER of HPAE. Npn-1 inhibition also attenuated both VEGF165-mediated pulmonary vascular leak and activation of VEGFR2, p38, and ERK1/2 MAPK, in inducible lung-specific VEGF transgenic mice. These data support a critical role for Npn-1 in regulating endothelial barrier dysfunction in response to VEGF and suggest that activation of distinct receptor complexes may determine specificity of cellular response to VEGF.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLaughlin, Joseph N</author><author>Mazzoni, Maria R</author><author>Cleator, John H</author><author>Earls, Laurie</author><author>Perdigoto, Ana Luisa</author><author>Brooks, Joshua D</author><author>Muldowney, James a S</author><author>Vaughan, Douglas E</author><author>Hamm, Heidi E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thrombin modulates the expression of a set of genes including thrombospondin-1 in human microvascular endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>22172-22180</pages><volume>280</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Amides</keyword><keyword>Amides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Apoptosis</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cluster Analysis</keyword><keyword>Complementary</keyword><keyword>Complementary: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers</keyword><keyword>DNA Primers: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix: metabolism</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Gi-Go</keyword><keyword>Gi-Go: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gq-G11</keyword><keyword>Gq-G11: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Indoles</keyword><keyword>Indoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Maleimides</keyword><keyword>Maleimides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Hybridization</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>PAR-1: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Peptides: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin</keyword><keyword>Pertussis Toxin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Promoter Regions</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Pyridines</keyword><keyword>Pyridines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>RNA: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thrombospondin 1</keyword><keyword>Thrombospondin 1: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins: cytology</keyword><keyword>Up-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15817447</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M500721200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15817447</url></web-urls></urls><label>Apoptosis;ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that affects vasculature systems such as platelet activation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Increases in THBS1 expression have been liked to disease states including tumor progression, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. The present study focuses on the effects of thrombin activation of the G-protein-coupled, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on THBS1 gene expression in the microvascular endothelium. Thrombin-induced changes in gene expression were characterized by microarray analysis of approximately 11,000 different human genes in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Thrombin induced the expression of a set of at least 65 genes including THBS1. Changes in THBS1 mRNA correlated with an increase in the extracellular THBS1 protein concentration. The PAR-1-specific agonist peptide (TFLLRNK-PDK) mimicked thrombin stimulation of THBS1 expression, suggesting that thrombin signaling is through PAR-1. Further studies showed THBS1 expression was sensitive to pertussis toxin and protein kinase C inhibition indicating G(i/o)- and G(q)-mediated pathways. THBS1 up-regulation was also confirmed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated with thrombin. Analysis of the promoter region of THBS1 and other genes of similar expression profile identified from the microarray predicted an EBOX/EGRF transcription model. Expression of members of each family, MYC and EGR1, respectively, correlated with THBS1 expression. These results suggest thrombin formed at sites of vascular injury increases THBS1 expression into the extracellular matrix via activation of a PAR-1, G(i/o), G(q), EBOX/EGRF-signaling cascade, elucidating regulatory points that may play a role in increased THBS1 expression in disease states.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Treeratanapiboon, Lertyot</author><author>Psathaki, Katherina</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Looareesuwan, Sornchai</author><author>Galla, Hans-Joachim</author><author>Udomsangpetch, Rachanee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vitro study of malaria parasite induced disruption of blood-brain barrier.</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</full-title></periodical><pages>810-818</pages><volume>335</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Plasmodium falciparum</keyword><keyword>Plasmodium falciparum: immunology</keyword><keyword>Plasmodium falciparum: physiology</keyword><keyword>Protozoan</keyword><keyword>Protozoan: immunology</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha</keyword><keyword>Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16105659</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.151</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105659</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS Invasion;ECIS Modeling</label><abstract>The mechanism of blood-brain barrier breakdown in the complex pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is not well understood. In this study, primary cultures of porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC) were used as in vitro model. Membrane-associated malaria antigens obtained from lysed Plasmodium falciparum schizont-infected erythrocytes stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha. In co-cultivation with the brain endothelial cell model, the malaria-activated PBMC stimulated the expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 on the PBCEC. Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, we detected a significant decrease of endothelial barrier function within 4h of incubation with the malaria-activated PBMC. Correspondingly, immunocytochemical studies showed the disruption of tight junctional complexes. Combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques provides a promising tool to study changes in the blood-brain barrier function associated with cerebral malaria.

Fibronectin matrix provides provisional tissue scaffolding during development and wound healing and is essential for the stabilization of mature extracellular matrix. Herein, we report that SPARC expression does not significantly affect fibronectin-induced cell spreading but enhances fibronectin-induced stress fiber formation and cell-mediated partial unfolding of fibronectin molecules, an essential process in fibronectin matrix assembly. By phage display, we identify integrin-linked kinase as a potential binding partner of SPARC and verify the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in vitro. Cells lacking SPARC exhibit diminished fibronectin-induced integrin-linked kinase activation and integrin-linked kinase-dependent cell-contractile signaling. Furthermore, induced expression of SPARC in SPARC-null fibroblasts restores fibronectin-induced integrin-linked kinase activation, downstream signaling, and fibronectin unfolding. These data further confirm the function of SPARC in extracellular matrix organization and identify a novel mechanism by which SPARC regulates extracellular matrix assembly.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Castaneda, Florencia E</author><author>Walia, Baljit</author><author>Vijay-Kumar, Matam</author><author>Patel, Neal R</author><author>Roser, Susanne</author><author>Kolachala, Vasantha L</author><author>Rojas, Mauricio</author><author>Wang, Lixin</author><author>Oprea, Gabriela</author><author>Garg, Pallavi</author><author>Gewirtz, Andrew T</author><author>Roman, Jesse</author><author>Merlin, Didier</author><author>Sitaraman, Shanthi V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeted deletion of metalloproteinase 9 attenuates experimental colitis in mice: central role of epithelial-derived MMP.</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>1991-2008</pages><volume>129</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Colitis</keyword><keyword>Colitis: chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Colitis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Colitis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Dextran Sulfate</keyword><keyword>Dextran Sulfate: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: pathology</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: cytology</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Intestinal Mucosa: pathology</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 9</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 9: genetics</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 9: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: cytology</keyword><keyword>Neutrophils: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Random Allocation</keyword><keyword>Salmonella Infections</keyword><keyword>Salmonella Infections: immunology</keyword><keyword>Salmonella Infections: pathology</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>Sepsis: immunology</keyword><keyword>Sepsis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16344067</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.gastro.2005.09.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16344067</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>There is mounting evidence that matrix metalloproteinases are the predominant proteinases expressed in the gut mucosa during active inflammatory bowel disease.

The mechanisms responsible for these changes are not well understood. One potential mechanism of increased vascular permeability is the anti-rickettsial nitric oxide response described by Walker and colleagues. We hypothesized that anti-rickettsial levels of nitric oxide adversely affects microvascular permeability in vitro. To this end we sought to describe the effects of exogenous nitric oxide on the proliferation of intracellular rickettsiae while monitoring the transendothelial electrical resistance as a measure of endothelial barrier integrity. It was determined that the addition of the NO-donor DETA NONOate at certain levels results in a dose-dependent change in electrical resistance across the monolayer while effectively limiting the number of intracellular rickettsiae in human microvascular endothelial cells. The data presented support the idea that nitric oxide produced by infected endothelial cells may be contributing to the changes in vascular permeability that occur during acute rickettsioses. Future experiments aim to elaborate on these results in a model that more clearly depicts the in vivo response as well as to describe the changes that occur with respect to interendothelial junctions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yin, Xiuyun</author><author>Knecht, David a</author><author>Lynes, Michael a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metallothionein mediates leukocyte chemotaxis.</title><secondary-title>BMC immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>21</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>CC</keyword><keyword>CC: chemistry</keyword><keyword>CXC</keyword><keyword>CXC: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CCL17</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CXCL12</keyword><keyword>Chemokines</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Cysteine</keyword><keyword>Cysteine: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells</keyword><keyword>Jurkat Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte</keyword><keyword>Leukocyte: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Metallothionein</keyword><keyword>Metallothionein: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Metallothionein: immunology</keyword><keyword>Metallothionein: isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Metallothionein: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Monoclonal</keyword><keyword>Monoclonal: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Rabbits</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology</keyword><keyword>Video</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16164753</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2172-6-21</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1262721&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Chemotaxis</label><abstract>Metallothionein (MT) is a cysteine-rich, metal-binding protein that can be induced by a variety of agents.

For tumor metastasis to occur through the blood vessel and lymphatic vessel pathway, the tumor cells must first adhere to endothelial cells. Recent studies have shown that high expression of CD44 in certain types of tumors is associated with the hematogenic spread of cancer cells. However, the functional relevance of CD44 to tumor cell metastasis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of CD44 cross-linking-induced adhesion and transendothelial migration of tumor cells using MDA-MB-435S breast cancer cell line. Breast cancer cells were found to express high levels of CD44. Using flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence staining, we demonstrated that cross-linking of CD44 resulted in a marked induction of the expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) by exocytosis. These results were also observed with the Hs578T breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, LFA-1- and VLA-4-mediated adhesion and transendothelial cancer cell migration were also studied. Anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-VLA-4 mAb alone had no effect on adhesion or transendothelial cancer cell migration, but were able to inhibit both of these functions when added together. This shows that CD44 cross-linking induces LFA-1 and VLA-4 expression in MDA-MB-435S cells and increases integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelial cells, resulting in the transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells. These observations provide direct evidence of a new function for CD44 that is involved in the induction of LFA-1 and VLA-4 expression by exocytosis in MDA-MB-435S cells. Because these induced integrins promote tumor cell migration into the target tissue, it may be possible to suppress this by pharmacological means, and thus potentially cause a reduction in invasive capability and metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCoy, Morgan H</author><author>Wang, Eugenia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing as a tool for quantifying cytopathic effect in influenza A virus infected MDCK cells in real-time.</title><secondary-title>Journal of virological methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of virological methods</full-title></periodical><pages>157-161</pages><volume>130</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cytopathogenic Effect</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Influenza A virus</keyword><keyword>Influenza A virus: isolation &amp; purification</keyword><keyword>Influenza A virus: physiology</keyword><keyword>Viral</keyword><keyword>Virology</keyword><keyword>Virology: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16095727</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jviromet.2005.06.023</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095727</url></web-urls></urls><label>Cytotoxicity;Virology</label><abstract>Resulting from its subjective nature, cytopathic effect (CPE) due to virus infection in cell culture has long been difficult to quantify. This report illustrates the use of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) for monitoring the progression of CPE due to influenza A virus infection. ECIS monitors the impedance of a non-invasive ac current flowing through cell culture medium by gold film electrodes placed on the surface of the culture dish. As cultured cells attach and spread onto the electrodes, the current is impeded proportional to the number of attached cells, the number of tight junctions between cells and the shortness in distance between the cells and the substratum. In the case at hand, a healthy monolayer of cells was insulted with influenza A virus infection and exhibited a characteristic rounded cell morphology and cell detachment. These effects resulted in reduced impedance, which was monitored with ECIS. Since data obtained through ECIS are both quantitative and in real-time, it was possible to monitor continuously cell behavior during infection. This, in turn, allowed for a more detailed and comprehensive data set to analyze. More importantly, through ammonium chloride treatment of cells, it was also shown that ECIS may be exploited to examine a treatment's effect on the reduction of resistance because of its antiviral activity. Thus, ECIS may be a powerful approach for screening antiviral compounds quantitatively in a real-time fashion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Fei</author><author>Subbaiah, Papasani V</author><author>Holian, Oksana</author><author>Zhang, Jihang</author><author>Johnson, Arnold</author><author>Gertzberg, Nancy</author><author>Lum, Hazel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lysophosphatidylcholine increases endothelial permeability: role of PKCalpha and RhoA cross talk.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We investigated the hypothesis that LPC signals increase in endothelial permeability. Stimulation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and bovine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with LPC (10-50 microM) induced decreases (within minutes) in transendothelial electrical resistance and increase of endothelial permeability. LPC activated (within 5 min) membrane-associated PKC phosphotransferase activity in the absence of translocation. Affinity-binding analysis indicated that LPC induced increases (also by 5 min) of GTP-bound RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42. By 60 min, both signaling pathways decreased toward baseline. Inhibition of RhoA with C3 transferase inhibited approximately 50% of LPC-induced resistance decrease. Pretreatment with PKC inhibitor Gö-6983 (concentrations selective for classic PKC), PMA-induced depletion of PKCalpha, and transfection of antisense PKCalpha oligonucleotide each prevented 40-50% of the LPC-induced resistance decrease. Furthermore, these three PKC inhibition strategies inhibited 60-80% of the LPC-induced GTP-bound RhoA. These results show that LPC directly impairs the endothelial barrier function that was dependent, at least in part, on cross talk of PKCalpha and RhoA signals. The evidence indicates that elevated LPC levels can contribute to the activation of a proinflammatory endothelial phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clements, Richard T</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author><author>Singer, Harold a</author><author>Keller, Rebecca S</author><author>Vincent, Peter a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RhoA and Rho-kinase dependent and independent signals mediate TGF-beta-induced pulmonary endothelial cytoskeletal reorganization and permeability.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

TGF-beta directly increases pulmonary endothelial myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which is associated with increased endothelial stress fiber formation, gap formation, and protein permeability, all hallmarks of pulmonary endothelial responses during acute lung injury. We performed the following experiments in pulmonary endothelial monolayers to determine whether RhoA and Rho-kinase mediate these TGF-beta-induced responses. TGF-beta caused the sustained activation of RhoA 2 h posttreatment associated with increased MLC phosphorylation. Inhibition of either RhoA or Rho-kinase with either C3 exoenzyme or Y-27632 blocked MLC phosphorylation. In addition, both C3 and Y-27632 partially attenuated the maximal TGF-beta-induced increase in permeability but did not affect the initial phase of compromised barrier integrity. Inhibition of Rho-kinase completely blocked the TGF-beta-induced increase in the content of filamentous actin (F-actin) but only partially inhibited TGF-beta-induced changes in actin reorganization. To assess the contribution of Rho-kinase in RhoA-mediated responses independent of additional TGF-beta-induced signals, cells were infected with a constitutively active RhoA adenovirus (RhoAQ63L) with or without Y-27632. RhoAQ63L increased MLC phosphorylation, F-actin content, and permeability. Treatment with Y-27632 blocked these responses, suggesting that Rho-kinase mediates these RhoA-induced effects. Collectively, these data suggest the following: 1) the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway is an important component of TGF-beta-induced effects on endothelial MLC phosphorylation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and barrier integrity; and 2) additional signaling mechanisms independent of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling cascade contribute to TGF-beta-induced changes in cytoskeletal organization and permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weidenfeller, Christian</author><author>Schrot, Sebastian</author><author>Zozulya, Alla</author><author>Galla, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Murine brain capillary endothelial cells exhibit improved barrier properties under the influence of hydrocortisone.</title><secondary-title>Brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain research</full-title></periodical><pages>162-174</pages><volume>1053</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: cytology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electron</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Factor VIII</keyword><keyword>Factor VIII: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hydrocortisone</keyword><keyword>Hydrocortisone: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry: methods</keyword><keyword>Inbred C57BL</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction: m</keyword><keyword>Serum-Free</keyword><keyword>Serum-Free: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transmission</keyword><keyword>Transmission: methods</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword><keyword>Western: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16040011</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.brainres.2005.06.049</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16040011</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling</label><abstract>Hydrocortisone is known to induce barrier properties in porcine primary cultures of microvascular endothelial cells. Here we present similar effects of hydrocortisone on a serum-free in vitro model based on primary cultured mouse brain endothelial cells. These cells in culture express typical blood-brain barrier properties and the transendothelial electrical resistance is enhanced after the addition of hydrocortisone to the medium in physiological concentrations. The improvement of the barrier is accompanied by changes at the cell borders indicated by immunofluorescence staining of tight junction proteins. Transmission electron microscopy imaging indicates morphological changes at the cell-cell contact zones which correlates to the observed changes in the transendothelial electrical resistance after HC supplementation. Phalloidin staining of F-actin shows a rearrangement to &quot;fiber-like&quot; structures in the longitudinal direction of the cell. These findings together with additional electrical impedance analysis of the monolayer suggest that several changes including cell-cell contact alteration, cell-substrate attachment and cytoskeletal rearrangements cause enhanced barrier properties in this murine endothelial culture. The present data are consistent with earlier findings in a porcine serum-free in vitro model. Thus, evidence is given that the barrier enforcement induced by glucocorticoids is not a species-specific effect and that the barrier improvement is correlated with a change of the cell morphology rather than changes in tight junction protein expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Finigan, James H</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Singleton, Patrick a</author><author>Chiang, Eddie T</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R</author><author>Camp, Sara M</author><author>Ye, Shiu Q</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activated protein C mediates novel lung endothelial barrier enhancement: role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor transactivation.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>17286-17293</pages><volume>280</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Blood Coagulation Factors</keyword><keyword>Blood Coagulation Factors: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Blood Coagulation Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dominant</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: pathology</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunoprecipitation</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Lung: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid</keyword><keyword>Lysosphingolipid: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>Protein C</keyword><keyword>Protein C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Sepsis</keyword><keyword>Sepsis: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Serine</keyword><keyword>Serine: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Threonine</keyword><keyword>Threonine: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional Activation</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>7737021051</isbn><accession-num>15710622</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M412427200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710622</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Increased endothelial cell (EC) permeability is central to the pathophysiology of inflammatory syndromes such as sepsis and acute lung injury (ALI). Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease critically involved in the regulation of coagulation and inflammatory processes, improves sepsis survival through an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized a direct effect of APC to both prevent increased EC permeability and to restore vascular integrity after edemagenic agonists. We measured changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and observed that APC produced concentration-dependent attenuation of TER reductions evoked by thrombin. We next explored known EC barrier-protective signaling pathways and observed dose-dependent APC-mediated increases in cortical myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in concert with cortically distributed actin polymerization, findings highly suggestive of Rac GTPase involvement. We next determined that APC directly increases Rac1 activity, with inhibition of Rac1 activity significantly attenuating APC-mediated barrier protection to thrombin challenge. Finally, as these signaling events were similar to those evoked by the potent EC barrier-enhancing agonist, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), we explored potential cross-talk between endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and S1P1, the receptors for APC and S1P, respectively. EPCR-blocking antibody (RCR-252) significantly attenuated both APC-mediated barrier protection and increased MLC phosphorylation. We next observed rapid, EPCR and PI 3-kinase-dependent, APC-mediated phosphorylation of S1P1 on threonine residues consistent with S1P1 receptor activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate an interaction between EPCR and S1P1 upon APC treatment. Targeted silencing of S1P1 expression using siRNA significantly reduced APC-mediated barrier protection against thrombin. These data suggest that novel EPCR ligation and S1P1 transactivation results in EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier protection, components potentially critical to the improved survival of APC-treated patients with severe sepsis.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Regard, Jean B</author><author>Scheek, Sigrid</author><author>Borbiev, Talaibek</author><author>Lanahan, Anthony a</author><author>Schneider, Armin</author><author>Demetriades, Anna-Maria</author><author>Hiemisch, Holger</author><author>Barnes, Carol a</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Worley, Paul F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Verge: a novel vascular early response gene.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>4092-4103</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animal</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Brain Ischemia</keyword><keyword>Brain Ischemia: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Hypoxia</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Developmental</keyword><keyword>Developmental: physiol</keyword><keyword>Disease Models</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activators</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activators: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Growth Substances</keyword><keyword>Growth Substances: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immediate-Early</keyword><keyword>Immediate-Early Proteins</keyword><keyword>Immediate-Early Proteins: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Immediate-Early Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Immediate-Early: genetics</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Myocardium</keyword><keyword>Myocardium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neovascularization</keyword><keyword>Organ Specificity</keyword><keyword>Physiologic</keyword><keyword>Physiologic: genetics</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Seizures</keyword><keyword>Seizures: chemically induced</keyword><keyword>Seizures: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15102925</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4252-03.2004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15102925</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Vascular endothelium forms a continuous, semipermeable barrier that regulates the transvascular movement of hormones, macromolecules, and other solutes. Here, we describe a novel immediate early gene that is expressed selectively in vascular endothelial cells, verge (vascular early response gene). Verge protein includes an N-terminal region of approximately 70 amino acids with modest homology (approximately 30% identity) to Apolipoprotein L but is otherwise unique. Verge mRNA and protein are induced selectively in the endothelium of adult vasculature by electrical or chemical seizures. Verge expression appears to be responsive to local tissue conditions, because it is induced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to transient focal cerebral ischemia. In contrast to the transient expression in adult, Verge mRNA and protein are constitutively expressed at high levels in the endothelium of developing tissues (particularly heart) in association with angiogenesis. Verge mRNA is induced in cultured endothelial cells by defined growth factors and hypoxia. Verge protein is dramatically increased by cysteine proteinase inhibitors, suggesting rapid turnover, and is localized to focal regions near the periphery of the cells. Endothelial cell lines that stably express Verge form monolayers that show enhanced permeability in response to activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters. This response is accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of paracellular gaps. These studies suggest that Verge functions as a dynamic regulator of endothelial cell signaling and vascular function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author><author>Smurova, Ksenya</author><author>Adyshev, Djanybek</author><author>Kaibuchi, Kozo</author><author>Alieva, Irina</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel role of microtubules in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1879-1890</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>G12-G13</keyword><keyword>G12-G13: metabolism</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors: physiology</keyword><keyword>Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Microtubules</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: physiology</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>rho-Associated Kinases</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein</keyword><keyword>rhoA GTP-Binding Protein: physiology</keyword><keyword>tau Proteins</keyword><keyword>tau Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15576491</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1096/fj.04-2328com</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15576491</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Disturbances in endothelial cell (EC) barrier regulation are critically dependent upon rearrangements of EC actin cytoskeleton. However, the role of microtubule (MT) network in the regulation of EC permeability is not well understood. We examined involvement of MT remodeling in thrombin-induced EC permeability and explored MT regulation by heterotrimeric G12/13 proteins and by small GTPase Rho. Thrombin induced phosphorylation of MT regulatory protein tau at Ser409 and Ser262 and peripheral MT disassembly, which was linked to increased EC permeability. MT stabilization by taxol attenuated thrombin-induced permeability, actin remodeling, and paracellular gap formation and diminished thrombin-induced activation of Rho and Rho-kinase. Expression of activated Galpha12/13 subunits involved in thrombin-mediated signaling or their effector p115RhoGEF involved in Rho activation caused MT disassembly, whereas p115RhoGEF-specific negative regulator RGS preserved MT from thrombin-induced disassembly. Consistent with these results, expression of activated RhoA and Rho-kinase induced MT disassembly. Conversely, thrombin-induced disassembly of peripheral MT network was attenuated by expression of dominant negative RhoA and Rho-kinase mutants or by pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time a critical involvement of MT disassembly in thrombin-induced EC barrier dysfunction and indicate G-protein-dependent mechanisms of thrombin-induced MT alteration.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luong, John H T T</author><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>LACHANCE, Bernard</author><author>Leabu, Š.Mircea</author><author>Li, Xiaolan</author><author>Uniyal, Shashi</author><author>CHAN, Bosco M C C</author><author>CAIDE, XIAO</author><author>LACHANCE, Bernard</author><author>LEABU, S Mircea</author><author>XIAOLAN, L I</author><author>Uniyal, Shashi</author><author>CHAN, Bosco M C C</author><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>LACHANCE, Bernard</author><author>Leabu, Š.Mircea</author><author>Li, Xiaolan</author><author>Uniyal, Shashi</author><author>CHAN, Bosco M C C</author><author>CAIDE, XIAO</author><author>LEABU, S Mircea</author><author>XIAOLAN, L I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extended applications of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing for assessment of the structure–function of α2β1 integrin</title><secondary-title>Analytica Chimica Acta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytica Chimica Acta</full-title></periodical><pages>61-69</pages><volume>501</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adherencia</keyword><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Adhérence</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cellule membrane</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Collagène</keyword><keyword>Colágeno</keyword><keyword>Célula membrana</keyword><keyword>Electroporación</keyword><keyword>Electroporation</keyword><keyword>Fibronectin</keyword><keyword>Fibronectina</keyword><keyword>Fibronectine</keyword><keyword>Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells</keyword><keyword>Impedance measurement</keyword><keyword>Impedancia</keyword><keyword>Impédance</keyword><keyword>Integrina β1</keyword><keyword>Intégrine β1</keyword><keyword>Laminin</keyword><keyword>Laminina</keyword><keyword>Laminine</keyword><keyword>Membrane cell</keyword><keyword>Monitorage</keyword><keyword>Monitoreo</keyword><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Rabdomiosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Rhabdomyosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Rhabdomyosarcome</keyword><keyword>cell adhesion</keyword><keyword>collagen</keyword><keyword>fibronectin</keyword><keyword>human rhabdomyosarcoma cells</keyword><keyword>impedance measurement</keyword><keyword>laminin</keyword><keyword>β1 integrin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aca.2003.09.016</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Extended applications of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing for assessment of the structure–function of α2β1 integrin - Luong, John H.T T.; CAIDE, XIAO; LACHANCE, Bernard; LEABU, S.

On collagen-coated gold electrodes, expression of this integrin on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (RDX2C2) yielded a five-fold increase in resistance when compared with mock transfected RD (RDpF) cells (34.5 ± 5.2 versus 6.5 ± 0.8 Ω/cell). An intermediate level of 16 ± 2 Ω/cell was measured upon expression of an α2β1 mutant that lacked the α2 cytoplasmic domain (RDX2CO). On laminin, the resistance measured for RDX2C2 cells was also higher but only twice that of RDpF cells at 71 ± 4 and 37 ± 4 Ω/cell, respectively. In comparison, RDX2CO cells (38 ± 4 Ω/cell), exhibiting no enhanced adhesive function, yielded a similar result to that of RDpF cells. On fibronectin, RDX2C2 and RDpF cells, exhibiting comparable levels of adhesion, were similar in resistance measurements at 85 ± Sand 89 ± 7 Ω/cell, respectively. It has been shown that deletion of a2 cytoplasmic domain results in dysregulated recruitment of the α2β1 mutant to focal adhesion complexes that mediate binding of fibronectin. RDX2CO cells on fibronectin, exhibiting reduced adhesive function, was associated with noticeably lower resistance (60 ± 4 Ω/cell). Monitoring electroporation of the RD plasma membrane also indirectly validated cell attachment as reflected by the resistance measured. Results from this study demonstrated the potential of ECIS for study of the structure-function of β1 integrin adhesion receptors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R</author><author>Dudek, Steven M</author><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author><author>Ye, Shui Q</author><author>Grigoryev, Dmitry N</author><author>Girgis, Reda E</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytoskeletal activation and altered gene expression in endothelial barrier regulation by simvastatin.</title><secondary-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>662-670</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cortactin</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeleton: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: ph</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins</keyword><keyword>Microfilament Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Simvastatin</keyword><keyword>Simvastatin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rac GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>rho GTP-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14630613</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2003-0267OC</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14630613</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The statins, a class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, directly affect multiple vascular processes via inhibition of geranylgeranylation, a covalent modification essential for Rho GTPase interaction with cell membrane-bound activators. We explored simvastatin effects on endothelial cell actomyosin contraction, gap formation, and barrier dysfunction produced by the edemagenic agent, thrombin. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to prolonged simvastatin treatment (5 microM, 16 h) demonstrated significant reductions in thrombin-induced (1 U/ml) barrier dysfunction ( approximately 70% inhibition) with accelerated barrier recovery, as measured by transendothelial resistance. Furthermore, simvastatin attenuated basal and thrombin-stimulated (1 U/ml, 5 min) myosin light chain diphosphorylation and stress fiber formation while dramatically increasing peripheral immunostaining of actin and cortactin, an actin-binding protein, in conjunction with increased Rac GTPase activity. As both simvastatin-induced Rac activation and barrier protection were delayed (maximal after 16 h), we assessed the role of gene expression and protein translation in the simvastatin response. Simultaneous treatment with cycloheximide (10 microg/ml, 16 h) abolished simvastatin-mediated barrier protection. Robust alterations were noted in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins (caldesmon, integrin beta4), thrombin regulatory elements (PAR-1, thrombomodulin), and signaling genes (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) in response to simvastatin by microarray analysis. These novel observations have broad clinical implications in numerous vascular pathobiologies characterized by alterations in vascular integrity including inflammation, angiogenesis, and acute lung injury.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Yuri V</author><author>Di Cello, Francescopaolo</author><author>Hillaire, Coryse S</author><author>Kim, Kwang Sik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Ca2+ signaling by thrombin and protease-activated receptor-1-activating peptide in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Here, using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining, we showed for the first time that PAR1-4 are expressed on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Digital fluorescence microscopy and fura 2 were used to monitor intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes in response to thrombin and PAR1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP) SFFLRN. Both thrombin and PAR1-AP induced a dose-dependent [Ca2+]i rise that was inhibited by pretreatment of HBMEC with the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 and the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Thrombin induced transient [Ca2+]i increase, whereas PAR1-AP exhibited sustained [Ca2+]i rise. The PAR1-AP-induced sustained [Ca2+]i rise was significantly reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium or in the presence of an inhibitor of store-operated calcium channels, SKF-96365. Restoration of extracellular Ca2+ to the cells that were initially activated by PAR1-AP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in significant [Ca2+]i rise; however, this effect was not observed after thrombin stimulation. Pretreatment of the cells with a low thrombin concentration (0.1 nM) prevented [Ca2+]i rise in response to high thrombin concentration (10 nM), but pretreatment with PAR1-AP did not prevent subsequent [Ca2+]i rise to high PAR1-AP concentration. Additionally, treatment with thrombin decreased transendothelial electrical resistance in HBMEC, whereas PAR1-AP was without significant effect. These findings suggest that, in contrast to thrombin, stimulation of PAR1 by untethered peptide SFFLRN results in stimulation of store-operated Ca2+ influx without significantly affecting brain endothelial barrier functions.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Blasio, Birgitte Freiesleben</author><author>Laane, Morten</author><author>Walmann, Thomas</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining optical and electrical impedance techniques for quantitative measurement of confluence in MDCK-I cell cultures.</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>650-4, 656, 658 passim</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Optics and Photonics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15088383</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15088383</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Growth</label><abstract>A new method combining optical and electrical impedance measurements is described that enables submicroscopic cell movements to be monitored. The cells are grown on small gold electrodes that are transparent to light. This modified electrical cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) allows simultaneous microscopic recording of both growth and motility, thus enabling cell confluence on the electrodes to be systematically correlated to the impedance in regular time intervals of seconds and for extended periods of time. Furthermore, the technique provides an independent measure of monolayer cell densities that we compare to calculated values from a theoretical model. We have followed the attachment and spreading behavior of epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney strain I (MDCK-I) cell cultures on microelectrodes for up to 40 h. The studies reveal a high degree of correlation between the measured resistance at 4 kHz and the corresponding cell confluence in 4- to 6-h intervals with typical linear cross-correlation factors of r equaling approximately 0.9. In summary, the impedance measured with the ECIS technique provides a good quantitative measure of cell confluence.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Chong-Chou</author><author>Putnam, Andrew J</author><author>Miranti, Cindy K</author><author>Gustafson, Margaret</author><author>Wang, Ling-Mei</author><author>Vande Woude, George F</author><author>Gao, Chong-Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overexpression of sprouty 2 inhibits HGF/SF-mediated cell growth, invasion, migration, and cytokinesis.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>5193-5202</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>30</issue><keywords><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Blotting</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Collagen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Drug Combinations</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Hepatocyte Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Hepatocyte Growth Factor: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hepatocyte Growth Factor: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Laminin</keyword><keyword>Laminin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leiomyosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Leiomyosarcoma: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Leiomyosarcoma: pathology</keyword><keyword>Luminescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Luminescent Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitogens</keyword><keyword>Mitogens: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mitogens: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Polyploidy</keyword><keyword>Proteoglycans</keyword><keyword>Proteoglycans: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Renal Cell</keyword><keyword>Renal Cell: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Renal Cell: pathology</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>Western</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15122328</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/sj.onc.1207646</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15122328</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>A strict regulation of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)-Met signaling is essential for its appropriate function. Several negative regulators of Met signaling have been identified. Here we report that human Spry2 is induced by HGF/SF and negatively regulates HGF/SF-Met signaling. We show that overexpression of Spry2 inhibits cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and migration in wound-healing and in vitro invasion assays. Measured in an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing biosensor, cell movement is restricted, because Spry2 dramatically facilitates cell attachment and spreading by enhancing focal adhesions and increasing stress fibers. An analysis of cell cycle distribution shows, unexpectedly, that Spry2-GFP cells are polyploid. Thus, as with FGF and EGF receptors, Spry2-GFP tempers downstream Met signaling in addition to its pronounced effect on cell adhesion, and it has properties suitable to be considered a tumor-suppressor protein.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iyer, Seema</author><author>Ferreri, Deana M</author><author>DeCocco, Nina C</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author><author>Vincent, Peter a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VE-cadherin-p120 interaction is required for maintenance of endothelial barrier function.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We used a number of approaches to alter the level of p120 available for binding to VE-cadherin as a means to investigate the role of p120-VE-cadherin interaction in regulation of barrier function in confluent endothelial monolayers. Expression of an epitope-tagged fragment corresponding to JMD of VE-cadherin resulted in a decrease in endothelial barrier function as assessed by changes in albumin clearance and electrical resistance. Binding of JMD-Flag to p120 resulted in a decreased level of p120. In addition to decreasing p120 level, expression of JMD also decreased level of VE-cadherin. Expression of JMD also caused an increase in MLC phosphorylation and rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton, which, coupled with decreased cadherin, can contribute to loss of barrier function. Reducing p120 by siRNA resulted in a decrease in VE-cadherin, whereas increasing the level of p120 increased the level of VE-cadherin, demonstrating that p120 regulates the level of VE-cadherin. Overexpression of p120 was, however, associated with decreased barrier function and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, expression of p120 was able to inhibit thrombin-induced increases in MLC phosphorylation, suggesting that p120 inhibits activation of Rho/Rho kinase pathway in endothelial cells. Excess p120 also prevented JMD-induced increases in MLC phosphorylation, correlating this phosphorylation with Rho/Rho kinase pathway. These findings show p120 plays a major role in regulating endothelial barrier function, as either a decrease or increase of p120 resulted in disruption of permeability across cell monolayers.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grab, Dennis J</author><author>Nikolskaia, Olga</author><author>Kim, Yuri V</author><author>Lonsdale-Eccles, John D</author><author>Ito, Susumu</author><author>Hara, Tatsuru</author><author>Fukuma, Toshihide</author><author>Nyarko, Elvis</author><author>Kim, Kwang Sik Kee Jun</author><author>Stins, Monique F</author><author>Delannoy, Michael J</author><author>Rodgers, Jean</author><author>Kim, Kwang Sik Kee Jun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>African trypanosome interactions with an in vitro model of the human blood-brain barrier.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of parasitology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of parasitology</full-title></periodical><pages>970-979</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: cytology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: parasitology</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electron</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: parasitology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Scanning</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Transmission</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei brucei: physiology</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</keyword><keyword>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15562595</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1645/GE-287R</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15562595</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>The neurological manifestations of sleeping sickness in man are attributed to the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invasion of the central nervous system by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. However, how African trypanosomes cross the BBB remains an unresolved issue. We have examined the traversal of African trypanosomes across the human BBB using an in vitro BBB model system constructed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) grown on Costar Transwell inserts. Human-infective T. b. gambiense strain IL 1852 was found to cross human BMECs far more readily than the animal-infective Trypanosoma brucei brucei strains 427 and TREU 927. Tsetse fly-infective procyclic trypomastigotes did not cross the human BMECs either alone or when coincubated with bloodstreamform T. b. gambiense. After overnight incubation, the integrity of the human BMEC monolayer measured by transendothelial electrical resistance was maintained on the inserts relative to the controls when the endothelial cells were incubated with T. b. brucei. However, decreases in electrical resistance were observed when the BMEC-coated inserts were incubated with T. b. gambiense. Light and electron microscopy studies revealed that T. b. gambiense initially bind at or near intercellular junctions before crossing the BBB paracellularly. This is the first demonstration of paracellular traversal of African trypanosomes across the BBB. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of BBB traversal by these parasites at the cellular and molecular level.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kilani, Muna M</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal a</author><author>Nasreen, Najmunnisa</author><author>Hardwick, Joyce a</author><author>Kaplan, Mark H</author><author>Tepper, Robert S</author><author>Antony, Veena B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Respiratory syncytial virus causes increased bronchial epithelial permeability.</title><secondary-title>Chest</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chest</full-title></periodical><pages>186-191</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Bronchi</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: virology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Viruses</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors: biosynthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15249461</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1378/chest.126.1.186</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15249461</url></web-urls></urls><label>TEER;Virology</label><abstract>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced diseases are mediated through active cytokines released during infection.

During hormone stimulation, the impedance is found to oscillate, reflecting that the cells undergo morphological/adhesive alterations with high spatio-temporal organization.

The present study demonstrates that, in contrast to the CR3 I-domain, Ab blockade of the CR3 LLD has no role in mediating neutrophil-induced loss of endothelial barrier function. However, activation of CR3 with the LLD agonist beta-glucan protects the barrier function of endothelial cells in the presence of activated neutrophils and reduces transendothelial migration without affecting adhesion of the neutrophils to the endothelium. The LLD site-specific mAb VIM12 obviates beta-glucan protection while activation of the LLD by VIM12 cross-linking mimics the beta-glucan response by both preserving endothelial barrier function and reducing neutrophil transendothelial migration. beta-glucan has no direct effect on endothelial cell function in the absence of activated neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that signaling through the CR3 LLD prevents neutrophil-induced loss of endothelial barrier function and reduces diapedesis. This suggests that the LLD may be a suitable target for oligosaccharide-based anti-inflammatory therapeutics.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kundranda, Madappa N</author><author>Ray, Sanhita</author><author>Saria, Margaret</author><author>Friedman, David</author><author>Matrisian, Lynn M</author><author>Lukyanov, Pavel</author><author>Ochieng, Josiah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annexins expressed on the cell surface serve as receptors for adhesion to immobilized fetuin-A.</title><secondary-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochimica et biophysica acta</full-title></periodical><pages>111-123</pages><volume>1693</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Annexin A2</keyword><keyword>Annexin A2: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Annexin A2: genetics</keyword><keyword>Annexin A2: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Annexin A4</keyword><keyword>Annexin A4: deficiency</keyword><keyword>Annexin A4: genetics</keyword><keyword>Annexin A4: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Antibodies</keyword><keyword>Antibodies: immunology</keyword><keyword>Antibodies: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD29</keyword><keyword>CD29: immunology</keyword><keyword>CD29: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Cell Surface: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV</keyword><keyword>Collagen Type IV: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Magnesium</keyword><keyword>Magnesium: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Mass</keyword><keyword>Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorpti</keyword><keyword>Protein Binding</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: genetics</keyword><keyword>Small Interfering: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Tumor</keyword><keyword>alpha-Fetoproteins</keyword><keyword>alpha-Fetoproteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15313013</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbamcr.2004.06.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15313013</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Fetuin-A is a major constituent of the fetal bovine serum used extensively in cell culture media. We hereby present data demonstrating that breast carcinoma cells can adhere to immobilized fetuin-A in a calcium-dependent fashion. Interestingly, the cells can also divide and attain confluency under these conditions. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified annexin-II and -VI as the putative cell surface receptors for fetuin-A in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by immunoprecipitation revealed that annexin-VI was expressed on the extracytoplasmic surface of the cell membranes. Finally, to demonstrate that annexin-II and -VI were the adhesive receptors for fetuin-A, siRNA knockdown of expression of the annexins significantly reduced the calcium-mediated adhesion. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the tumor cells could also adhere to immobilized fetuin-A in the presence of magnesium ions, and that this adhesion was most likely mediated by integrins because neutralizing antibodies against beta1 integrins substantially reduced the adhesion. Our studies suggest that the expression of annexin-II and -VI and possibly other members of the family mediate novel adhesion and signaling mechanisms in tumor cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tar, Krisztina</author><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Csortos, Csilla</author><author>Bakó, Eva</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphatase 2A is involved in endothelial cell microtubule remodeling and barrier regulation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cellular biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>534-546</pages><volume>92</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Actomyosin</keyword><keyword>Actomyosin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Fractionation</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: cytology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Microtubules</keyword><keyword>Microtubules: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nocodazole</keyword><keyword>Nocodazole: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Okadaic Acid</keyword><keyword>Okadaic Acid: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Phosphoprotein Phosphatases</keyword><keyword>Phosphoprotein Phosphatases: antagonists &amp; inhibit</keyword><keyword>Phosphoprotein Phosphatases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Protein Phosphatase 2</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword><keyword>tau Proteins</keyword><keyword>tau Proteins: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15156565</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcb.20036</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15156565</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>We have recently shown that microtubule (MT) inhibitor, nocodazole (2-5 microM) significantly increases endothelial cells (EC) actomyosin contraction and permeability indicating the importance of MT in maintaining the EC barrier (Verin et al. [2001]: Cell Mol Physiol 281:L565-L574). Okadaic acid (OA, 2-5 nM), a powerful inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), significantly potentiates the effect of submaximal concentrations of nocodazole (50-200 nM) on transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) suggesting the involvement of PP2A activity in the MT-mediated EC barrier regulation. Immunofluorescent staining of EC revealed that in control cells PP2A distributes in a pattern similar to MT. Consistent with these results, we demonstrated that significant amounts of PP2A were present in MT-enriched EC fractions indicating tight association of PP2A with MT in endothelium. Treatment of EC with OA leads to disappearance of MT-like PP2A staining suggesting dissociation of PP2A from the MT network. Next, we examined the effect of PP2A inhibition on phosphorylation status of MT-associated protein tau, which in its unphosphorylated form promotes MT assembly. OA caused significant increases in tau phosphorylation confirming that tau is a substrate for PP2A in endothelium. Immunofluorescent experiments demonstrated that the OA-induced increases in tau phosphorylation strongly correlated with translocation of phospho-tau to cell periphery and disassembly of peripheral MT. These results suggest the involvement of PP2A-mediated tau dephosphorylation in alteration of EC MT structure and highlight the potential importance of PP2A in the regulation of EC the MT cytoskeleton and barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, Yun C</author><author>Stins, Monique F</author><author>McCaffery, Michael J</author><author>Miller, Georgina F</author><author>Pare, Dan R</author><author>Dam, Tapen</author><author>Paul-Satyaseela, Maneesh</author><author>Kim, Kwang Sik</author><author>Kwon-chung, Kyung J</author><author>Paul-Satyasee, Maneesh</author><author>Mmun, I Nfect I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cryptococcal yeast cells invade the central nervous system via transcellular penetration of the blood-brain barrier.</title><secondary-title>Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Society</full-title></periodical><pages>4985-4995</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Brain</keyword><keyword>Brain: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Brain: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Cerebrovascular Circulation</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcosis</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcosis: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcus neoformans</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcus neoformans: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Cryptococcus neoformans: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electron</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Cells: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inbred BALB C</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation</keyword><keyword>Microcirculation: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Scanning</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>Am Soc Microbiol</publisher><accession-num>15321990</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/IAI.72.9.4985-4995.2004</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (

The mechanism(s) by which C. neoformans crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key unresolved issue in cryptococcosis. We used both an in vivo mouse model and an in vitro model of the human BBB to investigate the cryptococcal association with and traversal of the BBB. Exposure of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) to C. neoformans triggered the formation of microvillus-like membrane protrusions within 15 to 30 min. Yeast cells of C. neoformans adhered to and were internalized by the HBMEC, and they crossed the HBMEC monolayers via a transcellular pathway without affecting the monolayer integrity. The histopathology of mouse brains obtained after intravenous injection of C. neoformans showed that the yeast cells either were associated with endothelial cells or escaped from the brain capillary vessels into the neuropil by 3 h. C. neoformans was found in the brain parenchyma away from the vessels by 22 h. Association of C. neoformans with the choroid plexus, however, was not detected during up to 10 days of observation. Our findings indicate that C. neoformans cells invade the central nervous system by transcellular crossing of the endothelium of the BBB.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Walker, Sarah R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical wound-healing assay for cells in vitro.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>1554-1559</pages><volume>101</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cercopithecus aethiops</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electroporation</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Wound Healing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>14747654</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0307588100</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=341773&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration;Wound Healing</label><abstract>Confluent cell monolayers in tissue culture are fragile and can easily be mechanically disrupted, often leaving an area devoid of cells. This opening in the cell sheet is then repopulated, because the cells on the fringe of the damage, which are no longer contact-inhibited, move into the available space. This mechanical disruption is often done deliberately in a &quot;wound-healing&quot; assay as a means to assess the migration of the cells. In such assays, a scrape is made in the cell layer followed by microscopy to monitor the advance of the cells into the wound. We have found that these types of assays can also be accomplished electrically. In this approach, cells growing on small electrodes and monitored by using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing are subjected to currents, resulting in severe electroporation and subsequent cell death. After this invasive treatment, the electrode's impedance is again monitored to chart the migration and ultimate healing of the wound. We report here that this procedure to study cell behavior is both highly reproducible, quantitative, and provides data similar to that acquired with traditional measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kilani, Muna M</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal a</author><author>Nasreen, Najmunnisa</author><author>Tepper, Robert S</author><author>Antony, Veena B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RSV causes HIF-1alpha stabilization via NO release in primary bronchial epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Inflammation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Inflammation</full-title></periodical><pages>245-251</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Benzoates</keyword><keyword>Benzoates: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Bronchi</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: pathology</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: virology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: virology</keyword><keyword>Free Radical Scavengers</keyword><keyword>Free Radical Scavengers: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1</keyword><keyword>Imidazoles</keyword><keyword>Imidazoles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Nuclear Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Viruses</keyword><keyword>Respiratory Syncytial Viruses: pathogenicity</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: analysis</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors: antagonists &amp;</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors: metabolism</keyword><keyword>alpha Subunit</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>1075300460</isbn><accession-num>16133997</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10753-004-6047-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (RSV causes HIF-1alpha stabilization via NO release in primary bronchial epithelial cells. - Kilani, Muna M; Mohammed, Kamal a; Nasreen, Najmunnisa; Tepper, Robert S; Antony, Veena B)

Stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is important in both inflammation and edema formation. In this study we evaluated whether RSV induced release of nitric oxide (NO) by bronchial airway epithelial cells leading to the stabilization of HIF-1alpha and subsequent transcription of VEGF(165). Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were used; cell supernatants were analyzed. Western blot analysis was used for the detection of HIF-1alpha. Bronchial airway epithelial monolayer permeability was assessed using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) in real time. There was increased stabilization of HIF-1alpha in RSV infected cells. Addition of an NO inhibitor blocked RSV mediated HIF-1alpha expression. Antagonism of NO also inhibited VEGF production and HBEpC monolayer permeability. Our results demonstrate that in HBEpC, RSV induced NO causes stabilization of HIF-1alpha in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramirez-Icaza, Gail</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal a</author><author>Nasreen, Najmunnisa</author><author>Van Horn, Robert D</author><author>Hardwick, Joyce a</author><author>Sanders, Kerry L</author><author>Tian, Jun</author><author>Ramirez-Icaza, Carlos</author><author>Johnson, Mary T</author><author>Antony, Veena B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 downregulate paxillin expression in bronchial airway epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>426-434</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bronchi</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation</keyword><keyword>Down-Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-13</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-13: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-4</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-4: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Paxillin</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Th2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15163899</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/B:JOCI.0000029111.27168.c6</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are involved in the cellular recruitment and infiltration seen in asthma. The effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on cell-matrix interactions and epithelial shedding are unknown. We hypothesize that bronchial airway epithelial cells (BAEC) express paxillin, a structural focal adhesion protein, and downregulation of paxillin by Th2 cytokines lead to BAEC hyperpermeability. We showed by confocal microscopy the presence of paxillin in BAEC. We demonstrated by Western blot analysis that IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation results in downregulation of paxillin production. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation decreased epithelial cell-matrix attachment as measured by electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS). Our results suggest that Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 downregulate paxillin production by BAEC, thereby disrupting the cell-matrix interactions. This may help explain the epithelial shedding and epithelial membrane hyperpermeability that occurs in asthma.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl"

Attachment</label><abstract>In this work, the omega-amine alkanethiols, cysteamine (CA) and 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (11-AUT), were chemisorbed as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) onto 250-microm gold microelectrodes that were microlithographically fabricated within eight-well cell culture plates and investigated as a means to improve neuron-to-electrode surface attachment (NESA). Dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurements showed similar advancing, theta(a) (69 degrees and 65 degrees ), but contrasting receding contact angles, theta(r) (9 and 30 degrees ) for CA- and 11-AUT-SAMs, respectively. The corresponding hysteresis (Deltatheta(ar) = 60 and 35 degrees, respectively) indicates the CA-SAM displays greater amphiphilic character than the 11-AUT-SAM. A portion of the greater Deltatheta(ar) for CA-SAMs may arise from surface heterogeneity, as compared to sputter-deposited gold and 11-AUT-SAMs. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed a 6% increase (CA-SAM) and a 22% decrease (11-AUT-SAM) in surface roughness when compared to clean but unmodified, sputter-deposited gold. The extracellular matrix cell adhesion proteins, collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, were covalently coupled to the aminoalkanethiol-decorated gold electrodes via acid-amine heterobifunctional cross-linking. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged laminin, confocal fluorescence microscopy of both CA- and 11-AUT-SAM-modified and unmodified gold microelectrodes confirmed coupling of the protein to the electrode and was readily distinguishable from nonspecifically adsorbed protein. DCA measurements of laminin physisorbed directly onto gold or covalently immobilized via CA- or 11-AUT-SAM had similar advancing (ca. 63-65 degrees ) and receding (ca. 7-9 degrees ) contact angles. Tapping mode AFM of these protein-bearing surfaces likewise showed dimerized protein aggregates of similar surface roughness. PC-12 cells cultured to confluence on both unmodified and SAM-modified, protein-derivatized gold microelectrodes were examined by alternating current impedance (50 mV p-t-p at 4 kHz). CA- and 11-AUT-SAM-modified surfaces when serving as a foundation or covalently immobilized adhesion proteins produced highly stable and reproducible temporal impedance responses. On the basis of the magnitude and the reproducibility of the impedance responses, the CA-SAM-modified surfaces were identified as being best suited for optimal neuron-to-electrode contact with laminin. Laminin performed best when compared to collagen and fibronectin. Covalent immobilization of the adhesion-promoting proteins results in enhanced NESA by tightly anchoring cells to the electrode.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Usatyuk, Peter V</author><author>Fomin, Victor P</author><author>Shi, Shu</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Schaphorst, Kane</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of Ca2+ in diperoxovanadate-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and endothelial cell barrier function.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

One potential pathway is Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as cortactin that regulate endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton assembly. As DPV modulates endothelial cell signaling via protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we determined the role of DPV-induced intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in activation of Src kinase, cytoskeletal remodeling, and barrier function in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs). DPV in a dose- and time-dependent fashion increased [Ca2+]i, which was partially blocked by the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and Gd3+. Treatment of cells with thapsigargin released Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and subsequent addition of DPV caused no further change in [Ca2+]i. These data suggest that DPV-induced [Ca2+]i includes Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca influx through store-operated calcium entry. Furthermore, DPV induced an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Src and cortactin, actin remodeling, and altered transendothelial electrical resistance in BPAECs. These DPV-mediated effects were significantly attenuated by BAPTA (25 microM), a chelator of [Ca2+]i. Immunofluorescence studies reveal that the DPV-mediated colocalization of cortactin with peripheral actin was also prevented by BAPTA. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA had marginal effects on DPV-induced phosphorylation of Src and cortactin; actin stress fibers formation, however, affected EC barrier function. These data suggest that DPV-induced changes in [Ca2+]i regulate endothelial barrier function using signaling pathways that involve Src and cytoskeleton remodeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaphorst, Kane L</author><author>Chiang, Eddie</author><author>Jacobs, Keri N</author><author>Zaiman, Ari</author><author>Natarajan, Viswanathan</author><author>Wigley, Frederick</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of sphingosine-1 phosphate in the enhancement of endothelial barrier integrity by platelet-released products.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

How platelets enhance the permeability barrier of the vascular endothelium is not well understood. We measured the effect of isolated human platelets on human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity by monitoring transmonolayer electrical resistance. EC barrier function was significantly increased by the addition of platelets ( approximately 40% maximum, 2.5 x 106 platelets/ml). Platelet supernatants, derived from 2.5 x 106 platelets/ml, reproduced the barrier enhancement and reversed the barrier dysfunction produced by the edemagenic agonist thrombin, which implicates a soluble barrier-promoting factor. The barrier-enhancing effect of platelet supernatants was heat stable but was attenuated by either charcoal delipidation (suggesting a vasoactive lipid mediator) or pertussis toxin, implying involvement of a Gialpha-coupled receptor signal transduction pathway. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid that is released from activated platelets, is known to ligate G protein-coupled EC differentiation gene (EDG) receptors, increase EC electrical resistance, and reorganize the actin cytoskeleton (Garcia JG, Liu F, Verin AD, Birukova A, Dechert MA, Gerthoffer WT, Bamberg JR, and English D. J Clin Invest 108: 689-701, 2001). Infection of EC with an adenoviral vector expressing an antisense oligonucleotide directed against EDG-1 but not infection with control vector attenuated the barrier-enhancing effect of both platelet supernatants and S1P. These results indicate that a major physiologically relevant vascular barrier-protective mediator produced by human platelets is S1P.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Birukov, Konstantin G</author><author>Jacobson, Jeffrey R</author><author>Flores, Alejandro a</author><author>Ye, Shui Q</author><author>Birukova, Anna a</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Magnitude-dependent regulation of pulmonary endothelial cell barrier function by cyclic stretch.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

To explore whether excessive cyclic stretch (CS) directly causes vascular barrier disruption or enhances endothelial cell sensitivity to edemagenic agents, human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were exposed to physiologically (5% elongation) or pathologically (18% elongation) relevant levels of strain. CS produced rapid (10 min) increases in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, activation of p38 and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 MAP kinases, and actomyosin remodeling. Acute (15 min) and chronic (48 h) CS markedly enhanced thrombin-induced MLC phosphorylation (2.1-fold and 3.2-fold for 15-min CS at 5 and 18% elongation and 2.1-fold and 3.1-fold for 48-h CS at 5 and 18% elongation, respectively). HPAEC preconditioned at 18% CS, but not at 5% CS, exhibited significantly enhanced thrombin-induced reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance but did not affect barrier protective effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate (0.5 microM). Finally, expression profiling analysis revealed a number of genes, including small GTPase rho, apoptosis mediator ZIP kinase, and proteinase activated receptor-2, to be regulated by CS in an amplitude-dependent manner. Thus our study demonstrates a critical role for the magnitude of CS in regulation of agonist-mediated pulmonary endothelial cell permeability and strongly suggests phenotypic regulation of HPAEC barrier properties by CS.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Wetering, Sandra</author><author>van den Berk, Nadia</author><author>van Buul, Jaap D</author><author>Mul, Frederik P J</author><author>Lommerse, Ingrid</author><author>Mous, Rogier</author><author>ten Klooster, Jean-Paul</author><author>Zwaginga, Jaap-Jan</author><author>Hordijk, Peter L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VCAM-1-mediated Rac signaling controls endothelial cell-cell contacts and leukocyte transmigration.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Both integrins and Ig-CAMs are known to have signaling capacities. In this study we analyzed the role of VCAM-1-mediated signaling in the control of endothelial cell-cell adhesion and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of VCAM-1 on IL-1beta-activated primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (pHUVEC) induced actin stress fiber formation, contractility, and intercellular gaps. The effects induced by VCAM-1 cross-linking were inhibited by C3 toxin, indicating that the small GTPase p21Rho is involved. In addition, the effects of VCAM-1 were accompanied by activation of Rac, which we recently showed induce intercellular gaps in pHUVEC in a Rho-dependent fashion. With the use of a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor, it was shown that Rac signaling is required for VCAM-1-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, VCAM-1-mediated signaling toward cell-cell junctions was accompanied by, and dependent on, Rac-mediated production of reactive oxygen species and activation of p38 MAPK. In addition, it was found that inhibition of Rac-mediated signaling blocks transendothelial migration of monocytic U937 cells. Together, these data indicate that VCAM-1-induced, Rac-dependent signaling plays a key role in the modulation of vascular-endothelial cadherin-mediated endothelial cell-cell adhesion and leukocyte extravasation.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sawhney, Rajinder S</author><author>Sharma, Bhavya</author><author>Humphrey, Lisa E</author><author>Brattain, Michael G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrin alpha2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase are functionally linked in highly malignant autocrine transforming growth factor-alpha-driven colon cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>19861-19869</pages><volume>278</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>Butadienes</keyword><keyword>Butadienes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Chromones</keyword><keyword>Chromones: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Colonic Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids</keyword><keyword>Flavonoids: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha2</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha2: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: antagonists &amp; i</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: physiology</keyword><keyword>Morpholines</keyword><keyword>Morpholines: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Nitriles</keyword><keyword>Nitriles: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor alpha</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor alpha: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12657625</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M213162200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12657625</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>Recently, we have shown that autocrine transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) controls the expression of integrin alpha2, cell adhesion to collagen IV and motility in highly progressed HCT116 colon cancer cells (Sawhney, R. S., Zhou, G-H. K., Humphrey, L. E., Ghosh, P., Kreisberg, J. I., and Brattain, M. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 75-86). We now report that expression of basal integrin alpha2 and its biological effects are controlled by constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway. Treatment of cells with selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors PD098059 and U0126 showed that integrin alpha2 expression, cell adhesion, and activation of ERK are inhibited in a parallel concentration-dependent fashion. Moreover, autocrine TGF-alpha-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor activation was shown to control the constitutive activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, since neutralizing antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor was able to block basal ERK activity. TGF-alpha antisense-transfected cells also showed attenuated activation of ERK. Using a real time electric cell impedance sensing technique, it was shown that ERK-dependent integrin alpha2-mediated cell micromotion signaling is controlled by autocrine TGF-alpha. Thus, this study implicates ERK/MAPK signaling activated by endogenous TGF-alpha as one of the mechanistic features controlling metastatic spread.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiao, Jing</author><author>Huang, Fei</author><author>Lum, Hazel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PKA inhibits RhoA activation: a protection mechanism against endothelial barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We investigated the hypothesis that PKA inhibits Rho GTPases, which are regulator proteins believed to mediate endothelial barrier dysfunction. Stimulation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) with thrombin (10 nM) increased activated RhoA (RhoA-GTP) within 1 min, which remained elevated approximately fourfold over control for 15 min. The activation was accompanied by RhoA translocation to the cell membrane. However, thrombin did not activate Cdc42 or Rac1 within similar time points, indicating selectivity of activation responses by Rho GTPases. Pretreatment of HMEC with 10 micro M forskolin plus 1 micro M IBMX (FI) to elevate intracellular cAMP levels inhibited both thrombin-induced RhoA activation and translocation responses. FI additionally inhibited thrombin-mediated dissociation of RhoA from guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and enhanced in vivo incorporation of (32)P by GDI. HMEC pretreated in parallel with FI showed &gt;50% reduction in time for the thrombin-mediated resistance drop to return to near baseline and inhibition of approximately 23% of the extent of resistance drop. Infection of HMEC with replication-deficient adenovirus containing the protein kinase A inhibitor gene (PKA inhibitor) blocked both the FI-mediated protective effects on RhoA activation and resistance changes. In conclusion, the results provide evidence that PKA inhibited RhoA activation in endothelial cells, supporting a signaling mechanism of protection against vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Emerging Impedance Sensor Based on Cell-Protein Interactions: Applications in Cell Biology and Analytical Biochemistry</title><secondary-title>Analytical Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>3147-3164</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1081/AL-120026565</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/AL-120026565</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pearse, David B</author><author>Shimoda, Larissa A</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Bogatcheva, Natalia</author><author>Moon, Cheil</author><author>Ronnett, Gabriele V</author><author>Welsh, Laura E</author><author>Becker, Patrice M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of cGMP on lung microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction following hydrogen peroxide.</title><secondary-title>Endothelium : journal of endothelial cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Endothelium : journal of endothelial cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>309-317</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Gap Junctions</keyword><keyword>Gap Junctions: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gap Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen Peroxide: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Oxidants</keyword><keyword>Oxidants: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>14741846</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14741846</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The authors determined the effect of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced barrier dysfunction in bovine lung microvascular endothelial cell (BLMVEC) monolayers and compared the results to bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs). In BLMVECs, H(2)O(2) (250 microM) caused a 31.9% +/- 4.8% decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) associated with increased actin stress fiber formation, intercellular gaps, and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). The cGMP analogue 8-(p-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP (8p-CPT-cGMP; 30 or 50 microM) prevented the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease in TER (p &lt;.001) as well as the cytoskeletal rearrangement and intercellular gap formation. 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 microM) attenuated the peak (418.8 +/- 42.1 versus 665.2 +/- 38.0 nmol/L; p &lt;.001) and eliminated the sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i) (193.5 +/- 21.3 versus 418.8 +/- 42.1 nmol/L; p &lt;.001) caused by H(2)O(2). 8-pCPT-cGMP also increased TER (14.2% +/- 2.2%; p &lt;.05) and decreased [Ca(2+)](i) (201.2 +/- 12.5 vs. 214.4 +/- 12.1 nmol/L; p &lt;.03) before H(2)O(2). In BPAECs, 8p-CPT-cGMP significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced increases in permeability and [Ca(2+)](i) but less effectively than in BLMVECs. These results suggest that in BLMVECs, cGMP countered the adverse effects of H(2)O(2) on barrier function by preventing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and attenuating the increase in [Ca(2+)](i).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fox, Michael a.</author><author>Colello, Raymond J</author><author>Macklin, Wendy B</author><author>Fuss, Babette</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphodiesterase-Ialpha/autotaxin: a counteradhesive protein expressed by oligodendrocytes during onset of myelination.</title><secondary-title>Molecular and cellular neurosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular and cellular neurosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>507-519</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Developmental</keyword><keyword>Enzymologic</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Space</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Space: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase</keyword><keyword>Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Glycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Glycoproteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Glycoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Inbred Lew</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Multienzyme Complexes</keyword><keyword>Myelin Sheath</keyword><keyword>Myelin Sheath: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Oligodendroglia</keyword><keyword>Oligodendroglia: cytology</keyword><keyword>Oligodendroglia: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve: cytology</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve: embryology</keyword><keyword>Optic Nerve: physiology</keyword><keyword>Phosphodiesterase I</keyword><keyword>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases</keyword><keyword>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pregnancy</keyword><keyword>Pyrophosphatases</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Solubility</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>1804828947</isbn><accession-num>12837632</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1044-7431</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1044743103000733</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12837632</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>The initial stages of central nervous system (CNS) myelination require complex interactions of oligodendrocytes with their surrounding extracellular environment. In the present study, we demonstrate that commencing with active myelination oligodendrocytes express phosphodiesterase-Ialpha/autotaxin [PD-Ialpha/ATX (NPP-2)] as a non-membrane-associated extracellular factor. As such a component of the extracellular environment, PD-Ialpha/ATX has the ability to antagonize the adhesive interactions between oligodendroglial cells and known extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules present in the developing CNS. This counteradhesion requires intracellular signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins on fibronectin substrates and thus represents an active cellular response. Similar counteradhesive effects in other systems have been attributed to the activity of matricellular proteins, which support intermediate stages of cell adhesion thought to facilitate cellular locomotion and remodeling. Thus, the release of PD-Ialpha/ATX may be critically involved in the regulation of the initial stages of myelination, i.e., oligodendrocyte remodeling, via modulation of oligodendrocyte-ECM interactions in a matricellular fashion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On-line monitoring of cell growth and cytotoxicity using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS).</title><secondary-title>Biotechnology progress</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biotechnology progress</full-title></periodical><pages>1000-1005</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cell Count</keyword><keyword>Cell Count: methods</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Cricetulus</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure Analysis</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Lethal Dose 50</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Lung: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Lung: physiology</keyword><keyword>Mercuric Chloride</keyword><keyword>Mercuric Chloride: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Toxicity Tests: methods</keyword><keyword>Trinitrobenzenes</keyword><keyword>Trinitrobenzenes: toxicity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12790667</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bp025733x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12790667</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Cytotoxicity;ECIS Growth</label><abstract>An on-line and continuous technique based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was developed for measuring the concentration and time response function of fibroblastic V79 cells exposed to mercury chloride and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB). Attachment, spreading and proliferation of V79 fibroblastic cells cultured on a microarray of small gold electrodes precoated with fibronectin were detected as resistance changes. The response function was derived to reflect the resistance change as a result of cell attachment, spreading, mitosis and cytotoxicity effect. Exposure of V79 cells to mercury chloride or TNB led to alterations in cell behavior, and therefore, chemical cytotoxicity was easily screened by measuring the response function of the attached and spread cells in the presence of inhibitor. The half inhibition concentration, the required concentration to achieve 50% inhibition, was obtained from the response function to provide information about cytotoxicity during the course of the assay. A simple mathematical model was developed to describe the responses of ECIS that were related to the attachment, spreading, and proliferation of V79 fibroblastic cells. The novel results of this paper are mainly characterized by the systematic study of several parameters including the cell number, detection limit, sensor sensitivity, and cytotoxicity, and they may motivate further research and study of ECIS sensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal

Attachment;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>The adaptor protein SETA/CIN85/Ruk is involved in regulating diverse signal transduction pathways, including the internalization of tyrosine kinase receptors via the Cbl ubiquitin ligases, and attenuating PI3K activity by interaction with its regulatory subunit. Here we present evidence for a new aspect of SETA function, based on the initial observation that it co-localizes with actin in microfilaments and at focal adhesions, and with microtubules. Although there was no evidence for direct molecular interactions between SETA and cytoskeletal proteins, the SETA-interacting protein AIP1, which is a rat ortholog of the Xenopus src substrate Xp95, strongly interacted with structural proteins of the cytoskeleton, including actin and tubulins. Both SETA and AIP1 interacted with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK-2), and c-Cbl interacted with PYK-2. AIP1, which interacted more strongly than either SETA or c-Cbl, required an intact consensus tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sequence at Y319 to bind to focal adhesion kinases, which suggests that phosphorylation is an important mediator of this complex. SETA, which interacted as a dimer with focal adhesion kinases, promoted the interaction between PYK-2 and AIP1. Direct analysis of the impact of these proteins on cell adhesion, by use of an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS), showed that SETA promoted cell adhesion while AIP1 and c-Cbl reduced it. Furthermore, the ability of AIP1 and AIP1 mutants to decrease cell adhesion in ECIS analysis correlated with their presence in PYK-2 complexes, providing a direct link between AIP1-mediated molecular interactions and cellular behavior. Transfection of AIP1 also reduced the level of phosphorylation of endogenous PYK-2 and FAK, suggesting that this protein may directly regulate focal adhesion kinases, and thereby cell adhesion. These data are the first to implicate the adaptor protein SETA and its binding partner AIP1 as being involved with the cytoskeleton and in the regulation of cell adhesion, and suggest that they may be part of the focal adhesion kinase regulatory complex.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lum, Hazel</author><author>Hao, Zengping</author><author>Gayle, Dave</author><author>Kumar, Priyadarsini</author><author>Patterson, Carolyn E</author><author>Uhler, Michael D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vascular endothelial cells express isoforms of protein kinase A inhibitor.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

In this study, overexpression of rabbit muscle PKI gene into endothelial cells inhibited the cAMP-mediated increase and exacerbated thrombin-induced decrease in endothelial barrier function. We investigated PKI expression in human pulmonary artery (HPAECs), foreskin microvessel (HMECs), and brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs). RT-PCR using specific primers for human PKI alpha, human PKI gamma, and mouse PKI beta sequences detected PKI alpha and PKI gamma mRNA in all three cell types. Sequencing and BLAST analysis indicated that forward and reverse DNA strands for PKI alpha and PKI gamma were of &gt;96% identity with database sequences. RNase protection assays showed protection of the 542 nucleotides in HBMEC and HPAEC PKI alpha mRNA and 240 nucleotides in HBMEC, HPAEC, and HMEC PKI gamma mRNA. Western blot analysis indicated that PKI gamma protein was detected in all three cell types, whereas PKI alpha was found in HBMECs. In summary, endothelial cells from three different vascular beds express PKI alpha and PKI gamma, which may be physiologically important in endothelial barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lundien, Matthew C</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal a</author><author>Nasreen, Najmunnisa</author><author>Tepper, R S</author><author>Hardwick, Joyce a</author><author>Sanders, Kerry L</author><author>Van Horn, Robert D</author><author>Antony, Veena B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induction of MCP-1 expression in airway epithelial cells: role of CCR2 receptor in airway epithelial injury.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>144-152</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Bronchi</keyword><keyword>Bronchi: cytology</keyword><keyword>CCR2</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Chemokine</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CCL2</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CCL2: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Chemokine CCL2: physiology</keyword><keyword>Chemokine: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Chemokine: physiology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: pathology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-2</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-2: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides</keyword><keyword>Lipopolysaccharides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Transformed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12078856</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

We hypothesized that BEC monolayer injury results in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production, which initiates the repair process. BECs (BEAS-2B from ATCC) were utilized in this study. MCP-1 interacts with CCR2B receptor (CCR2B), resulting in cell proliferation, haptotaxis, and healing of the monolayer. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to verify the presence of CCR2B. CCR2B was not merely present but also inducible by interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that BECs express MCP-1 after injury and that receptor expression can be regulated by exposure to IL-2 and LPS. Haptotactic migration of cells was enhanced in the presence of MCP-1 and reduced in the presence of CCR2B antibody. This enhanced or depressed ability of the BECs to perform haptotactic migration was shown to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to controls. Finally, BECs proliferate in response to MCP-1 as proven by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology. MCP-1-specific antibodies were shown to neutralize the MCP-1-mediated BEC proliferation. This cascade of events following injury to the bronchial epithelium may provide insight into the mechanism of the repair process.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kataoka, Noriyuki</author><author>Iwaki, Kanso</author><author>Hashimoto, Ken</author><author>Mochizuki, Seiichi</author><author>Ogasawara, Yasuo</author><author>Sato, Masaaki</author><author>Tsujioka, Katsuhiko</author><author>Kajiya, Fumihiko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurements of endothelial cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate gaps and micromechanical properties of endothelial cells during monocyte adhesion.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>15638-15643</pages><volume>99</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Arteriosclerosis</keyword><keyword>Arteriosclerosis: pathology</keyword><keyword>Atomic Force</keyword><keyword>Biomechanics</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Elasticity</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes: analysis</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesions</keyword><keyword>Green Fluorescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing</keyword><keyword>Imaging</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1</keyword><keyword>Interleukin-1: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Luminescent Proteins</keyword><keyword>Luminescent Proteins: analysis</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Monocytes</keyword><keyword>Monocytes: cytology</keyword><keyword>Nanotechnology</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: analysis</keyword><keyword>Three-Dimensional</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12434019</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.242590799</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=137769&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling</label><abstract>The interaction between monocytes and endothelial cells is considered to play a major role in the early stage of atherosclerosis, and the involved endothelial cell micromechanics may provide us with important aspects of atherogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated (i) the endothelial cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate gaps with the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system, which can detect the nanometer order changes of cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate distances separately, and (ii) the endothelial cell micromechanical properties with an atomic force microscope after application of monocytes to endothelial cells. Application of monocytic THP-1 cells to IL-1beta-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells immediately decreased the electrical resistance of the endothelial cell-to-substrate (increase of the cell-to-substrate gap), whereas the endothelial cell-to-cell resistance (cell-to-cell gap) did not change. The elastic modulus of the endothelial cells decreased after 2-h monocyte application, indicating an increase of endothelial cell deformability. In conclusion, the interaction of the monocytes to the endothelial cells reduced the adhesiveness to the substrate and increased the deformability of endothelial cells. These changes in the adhesiveness and the deformability may facilitate migration of monocytes, a key process of atherogenesis in the later stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rotundo, Robert F</author><author>Curtis, Theresa M</author><author>Shah, Melissa D</author><author>Gao, Baochong</author><author>Mastrangelo, Anthony</author><author>LaFlamme, Susan E</author><author>Saba, Thomas M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TNF-alpha disruption of lung endothelial integrity: reduced integrin mediated adhesion to fibronectin.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We determined if reduced integrin function had a role in decreased endothelial cell adhesion to immobilized Fn after exposure of the endothelial monolayers to TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha also causes a reorganization of the subendothelial Fn rich matrix and a significant loss in RGD-dependent adhesion of TNF-alpha treated CPAE cells to pFn coated surfaces. However, flow cytometry revealed no decrease in alpha(5)beta(1) or total beta(1) integrin expression on the surface of the CPAE cells after TNF-alpha. Reduced CPAE adhesion to immobilized Fn was, in part, due to a loss of beta(1)-integrin function since the beta(1)-integrin blocking antibody mAb 13 significantly (P &lt; 0.05) prevented the adhesion of normal control CPAE cells but did not further reduce the adhesion of TNF-alpha-treated cells. In addition, antibodies which activate beta(1) integrins restored (P &lt; 0.05) adhesion of TNF-alpha-treated cells to immobilized pFn but did not alter the adhesion of control cells. Despite reduced ability to adhere to immobilized Fn, TNF-alpha-treated CPAE monolayers demonstrated increased binding and incorporation of fluid-phase pFn into the subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) as measured by the analysis of the deoxycholate (DOC) detergent insoluble pool of (125)I-Fn in the cell layer. In contrast to the RGD-mediated adhesion of CPAE cells to matrix Fn, the increased binding of soluble pFn after TNF-alpha was not inhibited by RGD peptides or mAb 13. Thus reduced integrin-dependent adhesion of the CPAE cells to matrix Fn as well as disruption of the Fn matrix may contribute to the increased protein permeability of previously confluent endothelial monolayer after TNF-alpha. In addition, increased ability for the monolayer to incorporate fluid-phase Fn into the ECM after TNF-alpha via a non-beta(1)- integrin dependent mechanism may be a compensatory response to stabilize the Fn matrix and the endothelial barrier.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>Lachance, Bernard</author><author>Sunahara, Geoffrey</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An in-depth analysis of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to study the attachment and spreading of mammalian cells.</title><secondary-title>Analytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1333-1339</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Cricetulus</keyword><keyword>Electricity</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11924593</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11924593</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>The attachment and spreading of fibroblast cells on a gold surface coated with fibronectin or ovalbumin were studied by a modified electric cell-substrate impedance sensor. In this system, cells were cultured in a well, equipped with a detecting gold electrode (surface area of 0.057 mm2) and a gold counter electrode (18 mm2). Based on a comprehensive theoretical framework, the impedance of the electrode-electrolyte interface and a cell layer was precisely obtained for frequencies ranging from 1 to 10 kHz. Surface concentrations of the protein adsorbed on the gold surface were determined by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. The resistance change of the electrode-electrolyte interface at 4 kHz increased linearly with the number of fibroblast cells attached on the detecting electrode. The slope of the linear relationship appeared to depend on the type of coating protein. As the surface area occupied by the cells was also proportional to the cell number, the resistance change was in turn proportional to the area covered by the cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Freichel, Marc</author><author>Vogel, Stephen M</author><author>Paria, Biman C</author><author>Mehta, Dolly</author><author>Flockerzi, Veit</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impairment of store-operated Ca2+ entry in TRPC4(-/-) mice interferes with increase in lung microvascular permeability.</title><secondary-title>Circulation research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation research</full-title></periodical><pages>70-76</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium Channels</keyword><keyword>Calcium Channels: genetics</keyword><keyword>Calcium Channels: physiology</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calcium: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Cell Size: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Knockout</keyword><keyword>Lanthanum</keyword><keyword>Lanthanum: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Lung: cytology</keyword><keyword>Lung: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>PAR-1</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Circulation</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Circulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Circulation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>TRPC Cation Channels</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: agonists</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12114324</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1161/01.RES.0000023391.40106.A8</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1161/01.RES.0000023391.40106.A8</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12114324</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>We investigated the possibility that the TRPC gene family of putative store-operated Ca2+ entry channels contributes to the increase in microvascular endothelial permeability by prolonging the rise in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Studies were made in wild-type (wt) and TRPC4 knockout (TRPC4(-/-) mice and lung vascular endothelial cells (LECs) isolated from these animals. RT-PCR showed expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 mRNA in wt LECs, but TRPC4 mRNA expression was not detected in TRPC4(-/-) LECs. We studied the response to thrombin because it is known to increase endothelial permeability by the activation of G protein-coupled proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). In wt LECs, thrombin or PAR-1 agonist peptide (TFLLRNPNDK-NH2) resulted in a prolonged Ca2+ transient secondary to influx of Ca2+. Ca2+ influx activated by thrombin was blocked by La3+ (1 micromol/L). In TRPC4(-/-) LECs, thrombin or TFLLRNPNDK-NH2 produced a similar initial increase of intracellular Ca2+ secondary to Ca2+ store depletion, but Ca2+ influx induced by these agonists was drastically reduced. The defect in Ca2+ influx in TRPC4(-/-) endothelial cells was associated with lack of thrombin-induced actin-stress fiber formation and a reduced endothelial cell retraction response. In isolated-perfused mouse lungs, the PAR-1 agonist peptide increased microvessel filtration coefficient (K(f,c)), a measure of vascular permeability, by a factor of 2.8 in wt and 1.4 in TRPC4(-/-); La3+ (1 micromol/L) addition to wt lung perfusate reduced the agonist effect to that observed in TRPC4(-/-). These results show that TRPC4-dependent Ca2+ entry in mouse LECs is a key determinant of increased microvascular permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Negash, Sewite</author><author>Wang, Hwai-Shi</author><author>Gao, Chun</author><author>Ledee, Dolena</author><author>Zelenka, Peggy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cdk5 regulates cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion in lens epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title></periodical><pages>2109-2117</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>Pt 10</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions</keyword><keyword>Cell-Matrix Junctions: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Crystalline</keyword><keyword>Crystalline: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinases: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cyclin-Dependent Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Lens</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: genetics</keyword><keyword>Messenger: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Nerve Tissue Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Rabbits</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11973352</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11973352</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which is expressed predominantly in terminally differentiated neurons. Lower levels of Cdk5 are also found in a wide variety of cell types, including the lens. Although Cdk5 has been shown to play an important role in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth, its function in non-neuronal cells is not known. Therefore, this study was undertaken to explore the role of Cdk5 in the lens. Results showed that, within the adult mouse lens, Cdk5 was localized to the cytoplasm, especially along the lateral membranes of differentiating primary fiber cells, which suggests a role in cell-cell adhesion. Staining at the tips of elongating fiber cells was also particularly strong, suggesting a role in cell-matrix adhesion. To examine the possible role of Cdk5 in lens epithelial cell adhesion, we stably transfected N/N1003A rabbit lens epithelial cells with cDNAs for Cdk5 or a dominant-negative mutation, Cdk5-T33. Attachment to a fibronectin matrix, as measured with substrate-coated cell adhesion strips, was increased by Cdk5 overexpression, while an equivalent overexpression of Cdk5-T33 had no effect. Cdk5 also increased the rate of cell attachment and spreading as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). In addition, Cdk5 overexpression decreased cell-cell adhesion as measured by a cell aggregation assay. These findings suggest that Cdk5 plays a role in regulating both cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions in the lens.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recovery of adherent cells after in situ electroporation monitored electrically.</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>348-357</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cercopithecus aethiops</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Electroporation</keyword><keyword>Electroporation: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Electroporation: methods</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Isoquinolines</keyword><keyword>Isoquinolines: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney: cytology</keyword><keyword>Kidney: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Kidney: physiology</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Species Specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12188187</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12188187</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Electroporation</label><abstract>Here we describe various experiments that address the efficiency of loading extracellular probes into the cytoplasm of adherent mammalian cells (normal rat kidney, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and African green monkey) by means of in situ electroporation. Subsequent cell recovery from the electroporation pulse was monitored electrically in real time for each condition. In this study, small, gold-film electrodes (5 x 10(-4) cm2) are used as culture substrates and at the same time as an electrode for both the application of the electroporating voltage pulse and the noninvasive electrical monitoring of cell recovery, using a technique referred to as ECIS. Electroporation has been performed by using ac sinusoidal voltage pulses of varying frequency, amplitude, and duration. Permeabilization and re-closure of the plasma membrane were evaluated by the uptake of the fluorescence probe, Lucifer Yellow, from the extracellularfluid. With the experimental setup described here, efficient electroporation was achieved with voltages less than 5 V. Using ECIS, we followed the morphological response of the cells to the electricfield-induced membrane permeabilization. For optimized electroporation conditions, cell recovery was completed in less than 1 h. The introduction of membrane-impermeable substances by electroporation and in situ monitoring of the cellular response mayfind many applications in cell biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Antony, Ajay B</author><author>Tepper, Robert S</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cockroach extract antigen increases bronchial airway epithelial permeability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>589-595</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>antigen</keyword><keyword>bronchial airway epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>bronchial epithelial</keyword><keyword>cockroach extract</keyword><keyword>vascular endothelial growth factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1067/mai.2002.127798</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674902001550</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Caide</author><author>Lachance, Bernard</author><author>Sunahara, Geoffrey</author><author>Luong, John H T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of cytotoxicity using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing: concentration and time response function approach.</title><secondary-title>Analytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>5748-5753</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antitumor</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival</keyword><keyword>Cell Survival: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Cricetinae</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxins</keyword><keyword>Cytotoxins: toxicity</keyword><keyword>Drug Screening Assays</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Neutral Red</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12463358</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Assessment of cytotoxicity using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing: concentration and time response function approach. - Xiao, Caide; Lachance, Bernard; Sunahara, Geoffrey; Luong, John H T)

Attachment and spreading of fibroblastic V79 cells cultured on small gold electrodes precoated with fibronectin were detected as electrical resistance changes. With this method, chemical cytotoxicity was easily screened by observing the response function of attached cells in the presence of inhibitor. The cytotoxicities of three test models, cadmium chloride, sodium arsenate, and benzalkonium chloride, were quantified by measuring the percentage inhibition as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The half-inhibition concentration, the required concentration to achieve 50% inhibition, derived from the response function agreed well with the results obtained using the standard neutral red assay.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charboneau, Aubri L</author><author>Singh, Vinita</author><author>Yu, Tingxi</author><author>Newsham, Irene F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suppression of growth and increased cellular attachment after expression of DAL-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>International journal of cancer.

This gene localizes to chromosome band 18p11.3, which undergoes loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas and a significant proportion of ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast. This finding suggests that alteration of gene(s) (possibly DAL-1) within this chromosomal region may be important early in the progression of breast disease. We generated MCF-7 cell lines expressing DAL-1 constitutively or under the control of an inducible promoter and analyzed the effect of DAL-1 expression on growth. These investigations revealed that the DAL-1 protein suppresses the growth of MCF-7 cells and may do so in part through the induction of apoptosis. In addition, expression of DAL-1 increased attachment of these cells to a variety of extracellular matrices. This is the first evidence that the DAL-1 protein functions at the interface between cell adhesion and apoptosis in controlling cell growth.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Bhawe, Kaumudi</author><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-time impedance assay to follow the invasive activities of metastatic cells in culture.</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>842-844,846,848-850</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Endothelium: cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis: physiopathology</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins: cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12398193</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12398193</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Invasion</label><abstract>Here we present research detecting the invasive activities of metastatic cells in vitro using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). The assay is based on previous microscopic observations, where metastatic cells added over established endothelial cell layers were observed to attach to and invade the cell layer. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) werefirst grown to confluence on small gold electrodes. The impedance of these electrodes was followed after the addition of suspensions of different sublines of the Dunning murine prostatic adenocarcinoma series (G, AT1, AT2, AT3, ML, and MLL). For highly metastatic sublines, within an hour after being challenged, the impedance of the confluent HUVEC layer was substantially reduced. The effect of the weakly metastatic sublines was less pronounced, and the extent and the rate of this drop in impedance could be correlated with the metastatic potential of each of six sublines tested. The real-time assay is effective in both normal and low (1%) serum concentrations, and the detected activity requires the presence of viable transformed cells. In addition to the murine cell lines, similar behavior was observed using four established human prostatic cancer lines (DU145, PC3, TSU, and PPC1). These results suggest that this ECIS-based assay might be used with primary human cultures to establish the metastatic abilities of cells isolated from biopsies.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldberg, Peter L</author><author>MacNaughton, Darren E</author><author>Clements, Richard T</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author><author>Vincent, Peter A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p38 MAPK activation by TGF-beta1 increases MLC phosphorylation and endothelial monolayer permeability.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

The role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was investigated because both kinases have been implicated in regulating gene expression after TGF-beta1. ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased threefold above the control level, and the increase was temporally associated with the increase in MLC-P. Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation with the MAPK kinase inhibitor U-0126 did not prevent the increase in either monolayer permeability or MLC-P. p38 MAPK phosphorylation increased fourfold above the control level, but unlike ERK1/2, this increase peaked 30 min and 1 h post-TGF-beta1 treatment. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity with SB-203580 prevented the increases in both monolayer permeability and MLC-P. Treatment of the monolayers with cycloheximide in conjunction with TGF-beta1-inhibited MLC-P, showing a requirement for protein synthesis. These studies demonstrate that p38 MAPK activation and subsequent protein synthesis are part of the signal transduction pathway leading to the TGF-beta1-induced increases in monolayer permeability and MLC-P.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sawhney, Rajinder S</author><author>Zhou, Guo-Hao K</author><author>Humphrey, Lisa E</author><author>Ghosh, Paramita</author><author>Kreisberg, Jeffrey I</author><author>Brattain, Michael G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences in sensitivity of biological functions mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor activation with respect to endogenous and exogenous ligands.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>75-86</pages><volume>277</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>CD: genetics</keyword><keyword>CD: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Epidermal Growth Factor: physiology</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Integrin alpha2</keyword><keyword>Ligands</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: analysis</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor alpha</keyword><keyword>Transforming Growth Factor alpha: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Tyrphostins</keyword><keyword>Tyrphostins: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>11684674</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M103268200</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11684674</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>Despite constitutive expression of autocrine transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in growth factor-independent colon carcinoma cells, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) is not saturated and can be further activated by exogenous EGFr ligand. Given that the activation of EGFr by exogenous growth factor has no further effect on DNA synthesis, the question arises as to what function this additional EGFr activation might have. We report that EGF induces integrin alpha2 expression, integrin-mediated adhesion, and micromotility of HCT116 cells. The stimulatory effect of ligand on these biological functions is abrogated by treatment with AG1478- and EGFr-blocking monoclonal antibody. This provides evidence that the biological responses are EGFr-mediated and EGFr is located upstream of integrin alpha2 expression. Therefore, although exogenous EGF has no effect on DNA synthesis beyond that induced by autocrine TGF-alpha (at subsaturating levels of EGFr occupation) exogenous growth factor does induce integrin alpha2 expression, cell adhesion, and micromotion. An important finding revealed by this study is the documentation of biological responses of EGFr-mediated functions, including DNA synthesis, cell adhesion, and micromotion, which differ in sensitivity with respect to different degrees of EGFr activation at the basal state and in response to exogenous ligand.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sriram, P S</author><author>Mohammed, Kamal A</author><author>Nasreen, Najmunnisa</author><author>Hardwick, Joyce</author><author>Van Horn, Robert</author><author>Sanders, Kerry</author><author>Antony, Veena B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adherence of ovarian cancer cells induces pleural mesothelial cell (PMC) permeability.</title><secondary-title>Oncology research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology research</full-title></periodical><pages>79-85</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Coculture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Growth Factors</keyword><keyword>Endothelial Growth Factors: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins: bio</keyword><keyword>Lymphokines</keyword><keyword>Lymphokines: biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Ovarian Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Pleura</keyword><keyword>Pleura: cytology</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A</keyword><keyword>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><accession-num>12392155</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12392155</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) carries a grave prognosis with median survival after diagnosis being 5 months. The major causes of MPE are lung, breast, ovary,and gastric cancer. It is still unclear how cancer cells penetrate the pleural mesothelial monolayer and reach the pleural space. In this study we examined the effect of ovarian epithelial cancer cells on a confluent pleural mesothelial cell (PMC) monolayer. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells adhere to the mesothelial monolayer in a time-dependent manner and induce PMC barrier dysfunction as evidenced by a drop in electrical resistance on electrical cell substrate impedance-sensing system (ECIS) and increased protein permeability. Barrier dysfunction is attenuated by addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody. Significant release of VEOF was noted when ovarian cancer cells were cocultured with PMC. Electron microscopy demonstrated gap formation in PMC monolayer only at the site of cancer cell attachment with surrounding areas remaining confluent.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, K V</author><author>Koenigsberger, C</author><author>Brimijoin, S</author><author>Bigbee, J W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct evidence for an adhesive function in the noncholinergic role of acetylcholinesterase in neurite outgrowth.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neuroscience research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neuroscience research</full-title></periodical><pages>165-175</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetylcholine</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholine: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholinesterase</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholinesterase: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholinesterase: genetics</keyword><keyword>Acetylcholinesterase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System: cytology</keyword><keyword>Central Nervous System: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Cholinesterase Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Neurites</keyword><keyword>Neurites: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Neurites: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Neurites: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Neuroblastoma</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11169626</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11169626</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can promote neurite outgrowth through a mechanism that is independent of its role in hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It has been proposed that this neuritogenic capacity of AChE may result from its intrinsic capacity to function in adhesion. In this study we directly tested this hypothesis using neuroblastoma cell lines that have been engineered for altered cell-surface expression of AChE. Using a microtiter-plate adhesion assay and the electrical cell-substrate impedance-sensing (ECIS) method, we demonstrate that the level of cell-substratum adhesion of these cells directly correlates with their level of AChE expression. Furthermore, this adhesion is blocked by either an anti-AChE antibody or a highly specific AChE inhibitor (BW284c51), both of which have also been shown to block neurite outgrowth. In addition, cells that overexpress AChE showed enhanced neurite initiation. By employing cell lines with different levels of AChE expression in two types of cell-substratum adhesion assays, our current studies provide evidence for an adhesive function for AChE. These results, together with the fact that AChE shares sequence homology and structural similarities with several known cell adhesion molecules, support the hypothesis that AChE promotes neurite outgrowth, at least in part, through an adhesive function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Garcia, Joe G N</author><author>Liu, Feng</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Birukova, Anna</author><author>Dechert, Melissa A</author><author>Gerthoffer, William T</author><author>Bamberg, James R</author><author>English, Denis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes endothelial cell barrier integrity by Edg-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Investigation</full-title></periodical><pages>689-701</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/JCI12450</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

The objective of this study was to determine the signal-transduction pathway that elicits this decrease in permeability. Permeability-decreasing activity of PCM was assessed by the real-time measurement of electrical resistance across cell monolayers derived from bovine pulmonary arteries and microvessels. Using a desensitization protocol with cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-enhancing agents and pharmacological inhibitors, we determined that the activity of PCM is independent of PKA and PKG. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, prevented the increase in endothelial electrical resistance. Because lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been proposed to be responsible for this activity of PCM and is known to activate the G(i) protein, inhibitors of the G protein pertussis toxin and of the associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) wortmannin were used. Pertussis toxin and wortmannin caused a 10- to 15-min delay in the characteristic rise in electrical resistance induced by PCM. Inhibition of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase with the mitogen-activated kinase kinase inhibitors PD-98059 and U-0126 did not prevent the activity of PCM. Similar findings with regard to the cAMP protocols and inhibition of G(i) and PI3K were obtained for 1-oleoyl-LPA. These results demonstrate that PCM increases endothelial electrical resistance in vitro via a novel, signal transduction pathway independent of cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG. Furthermore, PCM rapidly activates a signaling pathway involving tyrosine phosphorylation, the G(i) protein, and PI3K.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DePaola, Natacha</author><author>Phelps, Jeffrey E</author><author>Florez, Lucio</author><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author><author>Vincent, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical Impedance of Cultured Endothelium Under Fluid Flow</title><secondary-title>Annals of Biomedical Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Biomedical Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>648-656</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>electrical impedance</keyword><keyword>endothelial cells</keyword><keyword>shear</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1114/1.1385811</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?id=doi:10.1114/1.1385811</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Flow</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luong, J H</author><author>Habibi-Rezaei, M</author><author>Meghrous, J</author><author>Xiao, C</author><author>Male, K B</author><author>Kamen, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring motility, spreading, and mortality of adherent insect cells using an impedance sensor.</title><secondary-title>Analytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1844-1848</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Death</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Spodoptera</keyword><keyword>Spodoptera: cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11338600</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11338600</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Cytotoxicity</label><abstract>An emerging sensor technology referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) has been extended for monitoring the behavior of insect cells including attachment, motility, and mortality. In ECIS, adherent cells were cultured on an array of eight small gold electrodes deposited on the bottom of tissue culture wells and immersed in a culture medium. Upon the attachment and spreading of cells on the gold electrode, the impedance increased because the cells acted as insulating particles to restrict the current flow. Experimental data revealed that insect cells interacted differently with various proteins used to precoat the gold electrode with concanavalin A as the best promoter to accelerate the rate of cell attachment. After the cells were fully spread, the measured impedance continued to fluctuate to reflect the constant motion and metabolic activity of the cells. As the cell behavior was sensitive to external chemicals, the applicability of ECIS for inhibition assays was demonstrated with HgCl2, trinitrotoluene, trinitrobenzene (TNB), and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene as model systems. Unlike conventional assays, the quantitative data obtained in this study are taken in real time and in a continuous fashion to depict cell motility and mortality.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Linton, Michael</author><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correlated Motion and Oscillation of Neighboring Cells in Vitro</title><secondary-title>Cell Communication and Adhesion</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Communication and Adhesion</full-title></periodical><pages>139-145</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/15419060109080713</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15419060109080713</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandoval, Raudel</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author><author>Naqvi, Tabassum</author><author>Mehta, Dolly</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Requirement for Ca2+ signaling in the mechanism of thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Thrombin induced a 40-50% decrease in transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance and a twofold increase in 125I-albumin permeability in HUVECs, whereas it failed to alter the endothelial barrier function in ECV304 cells. Thrombin produced a brisk intracellular Ca2+ concentration transient and phosphorylation of 20-kDa myosin light chain in HUVECs but not in ECV304 cells. Thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was comparable in ECV304 cells and HUVECs, indicating the activation of thrombin receptors in both cell types. La3+ reduced both the thrombin-induced decrease in endothelial monolayer electrical resistance and the increase in 125I-albumin permeability in HUVECs. Because the absence of Ca2+ signaling could explain the impairment in the permeability response in ECV304 cells, we studied the effect of increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration in ECV304 cells with thapsigargin. Exposure of ECV304 cells to thapsigargin caused decreased endothelial monolayer electrical resistance and increased 125I-albumin permeability. These results indicate that Ca2+ influx and activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways are important determinants of the thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lum, H</author><author>Podolski, J L</author><author>Gurnack, M E</author><author>Schulz, I T</author><author>Huang, F</author><author>Holian, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein phosphatase 2B inhibitor potentiates endothelial PKC activity and barrier dysfunction.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that Ser/Thr PPs may regulate protein kinase C (PKC), a critical signaling molecule in barrier dysfunction, in the promotion of barrier recovery. Western analysis indicated that bovine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (BPMECs) expressed the three major Ser/Thr PPs, PP1, PP2A, and PP2B. Pretreatment with 100 ng/ml of FK506 (a PP2B inhibitor) but not with the PP1 and PP2A inhibitors calyculin A or okadaic acid potentiated the thrombin-induced increase in PKC phosphotransferase activity. FK506 also potentiated thrombin-induced PKC-alpha but not PKC-beta phosphorylation. FK506 but not calyculin A or okadaic acid inhibited recovery from the thrombin-induced decrease in transendothelial resistance. Neither FK506 nor okadaic acid altered the thrombin-induced resistance decrease, whereas calyculin A potentiated the decrease. Downregulation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate rescued the FK506-mediated inhibition of recovery, which was consistent with the finding that the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of PKC-alpha was reduced during the recovery phase. These results indicated that PP2B may play a physiologically important role in returning endothelial barrier dysfunction to normal through the regulation of PKC.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hadjout, Nacima</author><author>Laevsky, G</author><author>Knecht, David A</author><author>Lynes, Michael A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated real-time measurement of chemotactic cell motility.</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>1130-1138</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium: physiology</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Folic Acid</keyword><keyword>Folic Acid: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11730019</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11730019</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Migration</label><abstract>We have developed a novel method, (ECIS/taxis), for monitoring cell movement in response to chemotactic and chemokinetic factors. In this system, cells migrate in an under-agarose environment, and their positions are monitored using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensor technology to measure the impedance change at a target electrode, that is lithographed onto the substrate, as the cells arrive at the target. In the studies reported here, Dictyostelium discoideum was used as a prototypical, motile eukaryotic cell. Using the ECIS/taxis system, the arrival of cells at the target electrode was proportional to the dose offolate used to stimulate the cells and could be assessed by changes in resistance at the electrode. ECIS/taxis was readily able to distinguish between wild-type cells and a mutant that is deficient in its chemotactic response. Finally, we have shown that an agent that interferes with chemotactic motility leads to the delayed arrival of cells at the target electrode. The multi-well assay configuration allows for simultaneous automated screening of many samples for chemotactic or anti-chemotactic activity. This assay system is compatible with measurements of mammalian cell movement and should be valuable in the assessment of both agonists and antagonists of cell movement.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandoval, R</author><author>Malik, a B</author><author>Minshall, R D</author><author>Kouklis, P</author><author>Ellis, C a</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ca(2+) signalling and PKCalpha activate increased endothelial permeability by disassembly of VE-cadherin junctions.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>433-445</pages><volume>533</volume><issue>Pt 2</issue><keywords><keyword>Albumins</keyword><keyword>Albumins: pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>Antigens</keyword><keyword>CD</keyword><keyword>Cadherins</keyword><keyword>Cadherins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Calcium Signaling: physiology</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens</keyword><keyword>Carcinogens: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cytoskeletal Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Desmoplakins</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics</keyword><keyword>Hemostatics: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Iodine Radioisotopes</keyword><keyword>Iodine Radioisotopes: diagnostic use</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes</keyword><keyword>Isoenzymes: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes</keyword><keyword>Naphthalenes: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C-alpha</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase C: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers</keyword><keyword>Stress Fibers: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate</keyword><keyword>Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thapsigargin</keyword><keyword>Thapsigargin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins</keyword><keyword>Umbilical Veins: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><accession-num>11389203</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2278647&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Calcium Signaling;ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>1. The role of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in the mechanism of increased endothelial permeability was studied. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to thapsigargin or thrombin at concentrations that resulted in similar increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). The rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in both cases was due to release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca(2+). 2. Both agents decreased endothelial cell monolayer electrical resistance (a measure of endothelial cell shape change) and increased transendothelial (125)I-albumin permeability. Thapsigargin induced activation of PKCalpha and discontinuities in VE-cadherin junctions without formation of actin stress fibres. Thrombin also induced PKCalpha activation and similar alterations in VE-cadherin junctions, but in association with actin stress fibre formation. 3. Thapsigargin failed to promote phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chain (MLC(20)), whereas thrombin induced MLC(20) phosphorylation consistent with formation of actin stress fibres. 4. Calphostin C pretreatment prevented the disruption of VE-cadherin junctions and the decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance caused by both agents. Thus, the increased [Ca(2+)](i) elicited by thapsigargin and thrombin may activate a calphostin C-sensitive PKC pathway that signals VE-cadherin junctional disassembly and increased endothelial permeability. 5. Results suggest a critical role for Ca(2+) signalling and activation of PKCalpha in mediating the disruption of VE-cadherin junctions, and thereby in the mechanism of increased endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Minnear, Fred L</author><author>Patil, Sandeep</author><author>Bell, Donald</author><author>Gainor, Jonathan P</author><author>Morton, C A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platelet lipid(s) bound to albumin increases endothelial electrical resistance: mimicked by LPA.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

A decrease in permeability was assessed by an increase in electrical resistance across endothelial cell monolayers derived from bovine pulmonary arteries and microvessels. The Sephacryl S-200 fraction of PCM that contained albumin, the albumin immunoprecipitate from the PCM, and the methanol extract from the albumin immunoprecipitate all increased endothelial electrical resistance. Increased electrical resistance induced by PCM was not abolished by boiling and was mimicked by 1-oleoyl-LPA and 1-palmitoyl-LPA. Analysis of a methanol-chloroform extract of one sample of PCM by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed many fatty acids, ceramide, diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and palmitoyl-LPA, but analysis of a second sample of PCM and the methanol extract of its albumin immunoprecipitate revealed no LPA, only lipids. These findings indicate that a bioactive lipid(s), possibly LPA, released from platelets and subsequently bound to albumin forms an active complex that decreases endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Becker, Patrice M</author><author>Verin, Alexander D</author><author>Booth, M A</author><author>Liu, Feng</author><author>Birukova, Anna</author><author>Garcia, J G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential regulation of diverse physiological responses to VEGF in pulmonary endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that VEGF elicits increased endothelial permeability and cell migration via differential activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. To test this hypothesis, we established a model of VEGF-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction and chemotaxis with bovine pulmonary endothelial cells. We compared the effects of VEGF on transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and chemotaxis of lung endothelial cells and then evaluated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in VEGF-mediated endothelial responses. The dose response of pulmonary arterial and lung microvascular endothelial cells to VEGF differed when barrier regulation and chemotaxis were evaluated. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, or p38 MAPK significantly attenuated VEGF-mediated TER, F-actin remodeling, and chemotaxis. VEGF-mediated decreased TER was also significantly attenuated by inhibition of ERK1/2 MAPK but not by inhibition of fetal liver kinase-1 (flk-1) or Src kinase. In contrast, VEGF-mediated endothelial migration was not attenuated by ERK1/2 inhibition but was abolished by inhibition of either flk-1 or Src kinase. These data suggest potential mechanisms by which VEGF may differentially mediate physiological responses in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) as a noninvasive means to monitor the kinetics of cell spreading to artificial surfaces.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>158-166</pages><volume>259</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Computer Systems</keyword><keyword>Electric Conductivity</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Integrins</keyword><keyword>Integrins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Kidney: cytology</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10942588</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/excr.2000.4919</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10942588</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label><abstract>This article describes the optimization of an experimental technique referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to monitor attachment and spreading of mammalian cells quantitatively and in real time. The method is based on measuring changes in AC impedance of small gold-film electrodes deposited on a culture dish and used as growth substrate. Based on experimental data and theoretical considerations we demonstrate that high-frequency capacitance measurements (f = 40 kHz) are most suited to follow the increasing surface coverage of the electrode due to cell spreading. The excellent time resolution of the method allowed an in-depth analysis of cell spreading kinetics under various experimental conditions. Using ECIS we studied the attachment and spreading of epithelial MDCK cells (strain II) on different protein coatings, and investigated the influence of divalent cations on spreading kinetics. We quantified the inhibitory effect of soluble peptides that mimic the recognition sequence of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins (RGDS). We also applied the ECIS technique to monitor the detachment of confluent fibroblastic cell layers (WI38/VA-13) by means of these peptides.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phelps, Jeffrey E</author><author>DePaola, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial variations in endothelial barrier function in disturbed flows in vitro.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

In this study, endothelial permeability to macromolecules and endothelial electrical resistance were investigated in vitro in monolayers exposed to disturbed flow fields that model spatial variations in fluid shear stress found at arterial bifurcations. After 5 h of flow, areas of high shear stress gradients showed a 5.5-fold increase in transendothelial transport of dextran (molecular weight 70,000) compared with no-flow controls. Areas of undisturbed fully developed flow, within the same monolayer, showed a 2.9-fold increase. Monolayer electrical resistance decreased with exposure to flow. The resistance measured during flow and the rate of change in monolayer resistance after removal of flow were lowest in the vicinity of flow reattachment (highest shear stress gradients). These results demonstrate that endothelial barrier function and permeability to macromolecules are regulated by spatial variations in shear stress forces in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patterson, C E</author><author>Lum, H</author><author>Schaphorst, K L</author><author>Verin, A D</author><author>Garcia, J G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of endothelial barrier function by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.</title><secondary-title>Endothelium : journal of endothelial cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Endothelium : journal of endothelial cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>287-308</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Actins</keyword><keyword>Actins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Activation</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Kinase 1</keyword><keyword>Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains</keyword><keyword>Myosin Light Chains: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: enzymology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11201526</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11201526</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Elevation of cAMP promotes the endothelial cell (EC) barrier and protects the lung from edema development. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that both increases and decreases in PKA modulate EC function and coordinate distribution of regulatory, adherence, and cytoskeletal proteins. Inhibition of PKA activity by RpcAMPS and activation by cholera toxin was verified by assay of kemptide phosphorylation in digitonin permeabilized EC. Inhibition of PKA by RpcAMPS or overexpression of the endogenous inhibitor, PKI, decreased monolayer electrical impedance and exacerbated the decreases produced by agonists (thrombin and PMA). RpcAMPS directly increased F-actin content and organization into stress fibers, increased co-staining of actin with both phosphatase 2B and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), caused reorganization of focal adhesions, and decreased catenin at cell borders. These findings are similar to those evoked by thrombin. In contrast, cholera toxin prevented the agonist-induced resistance decrease and protein redistribution. Although PKA activation attenuated thrombin-induced myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, PKA inhibition per se did not cause MLC phosphorylation or affect [Ca2+]i. These studies indicate that a decrease in PKA activity alone can produce disruption of barrier function via mechanisms not involving MLCK and support a central role for cAMP/PKA in regulation of cytoskeletal and adhesive protein function in EC which correlates with altered barrier function.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Yan, Weihong</author><author>Sandoval, Raudel</author><author>Naqvi, Tabassum</author><author>Pronin, Alexey N A N</author><author>Benovic, J L Jeffery L J L</author><author>Malik, Asrar B A B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 regulates thrombin-activated signaling in endothelial cells</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>7440</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5</keyword><keyword>G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><publisher>National Acad Sciences</publisher><accession-num>10861009</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.97.13.7440</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 regulates thrombin-activated signaling in endothelial cells - Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy; Yan, Weihong; Sandoval, Raudel; Naqvi, Tabassum; Pronin, Alexey N A.N.; Benovic, Jeffery L J.L.; Malik, Asrar B A.B.)

GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 isoforms were expressed predominantly in endothelial cells. The function of these isoforms was studied by expressing wild-type and dominant negative (dn) mutants in endothelial cells. We determined the responses to thrombin, which activates intracellular signaling in endothelial cells by cleaving the NH(2) terminus of the G protein-coupled proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). We measured changes in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in response to thrombin as well as the state of endothelial activation. In the latter studies, the transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance, a measure of the loss of endothelial barrier function, was measured in real time. Of the three isoforms, GRK5 overexpression was selective in markedly reducing the thrombin-activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increased [Ca(2+)](i). GRK5 overexpression also inhibited the thrombin-induced decrease in endothelial monolayer resistance by 75%. These effects of GRK5 overexpression occurred in association with the specific increase in the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of PAR-1. In contrast to the effects of GRK5 overexpression, the expression of the dn-GRK5 mutant produced a long-lived increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to thrombin, whereas dn-GRK2 had no effect. These results indicate the crucial role of the GRK5 isoform in the mechanism of thrombin-induced desensitization of PAR-1 in endothelial cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellen, R P</author><author>Ko, K S</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min M</author><author>Grove, D a</author><author>Ishihara, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insertional inactivation of the prtP gene of Treponema denticola confirms dentilisin's disruption of epithelial junctions.</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>581-586</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacterial Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Adhesion: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Chymotrypsin</keyword><keyword>Chymotrypsin: genetics</keyword><keyword>Chymotrypsin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Gingiva</keyword><keyword>Gingiva: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Gingiva: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gingiva: ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Insertional</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Microbial</keyword><keyword>Microbial: genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Periodontal Diseases</keyword><keyword>Periodontal Diseases: microbiology</keyword><keyword>Treponema</keyword><keyword>Treponema: cytology</keyword><keyword>Treponema: genetics</keyword><keyword>Treponema: physiology</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11075935</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11075935</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>The purified chymotrypsin-like protease of Treponema denticola, designated dentilisin or PrtP (DDBJ accession no. D83264), can disrupt cell-cell junctions and impair the barrier function of epithelial monolayers in vitro. Serine protease inhibitors block these effects. Yet, the protease is apparently less significant in perturbing intracellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal rearrangement in fibroblasts. The purpose of this study was to use a PrtP-deficient mutant of T. denticola to confirm that the cytopathic effects of whole bacteria and its outer membrane on epithelial cell junctions were primarily accounted for by the activity of this protease. The prtP gene of ATCC 35405 was inactivated by insertion of an erythromycin-resistance cassette, yielding mutant K1. In contrast to wildtype ATCC 35405, mutant K1 grew in tight cell aggregates; the cells had a disrupted outer sheath, as determined by electron microscopy. When compared by silver stained SDS-PAGE of sonicated extracts of whole cells, the extract of mutant K1 was missing a band at approximately 90 kDa that was present in the wildtype ATCC 35405 strain. Whole cells and Triton X-100 outer membrane (OM) extracts of K1 and the wildtype strains were compared 1) for SAAPNA degrading activity by a colorimetric assay, 2) for stress fiber disruption in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) by fluorescence microscopy of TRITC-phalloidin stained cells, and 3) the OM extracts only for perturbation of HEp-2 epithelial monolayers by electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Mutant K-1 cells and OM had no SAPPNA degrading activity that is characteristic of dentilisin. K1 cells had HGF stress fiber disrupting activity (86 +/- 4.5% of HGFs affected) equivalent to both 35405 wildtype strains (84 +/- 3.9% and 71 +/- 14.1% of HGF, respectively). Yet, mutant K1 OM had diminished stress fiber disrupting activity (12.9 +/- 4.6% of HGF) compared with its parent 35405's OM (94.6 +/- 2.9%). The major cytopathogenic difference between the K1 mutant and wildtype strains was in their OM's effect on epithelial cell junctions. ATCC 35405 OM completely disrupted epithelial resistance in a concentration - dependent manner; mutant K1 OM had negligible effects. These data confirm that inactivation of the prtP gene completely reverses T. denticola's disruption of epithelial junctions, but there are pleiotropic effects of the mutation that may account for its apparently diminished effects on the cytoskeleton of HGF when the cells were challenged with OM extracts.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moy, A B B</author><author>Winter, Michael</author><author>Kamath, Anant</author><author>Blackwell, K</author><author>Reyes, Gina</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author><author>Keese, Charles</author><author>Shasby, D Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histamine alters endothelial barrier function at cell-cell and cell-matrix sites.</title><secondary-title>American journal of physiology.

Based on this approach, histamine initiated a rapid decrease in transendothelial resistance predominantly through decreases in cell-cell resistance in confluent cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Restoration of resistance was characterized by initially increasing cell-matrix resistance, with later increases in cell-cell resistance. Thus histamine disrupts barrier function by specifically disrupting cell-cell adhesion and restores barrier function in part through direct effects on cell-matrix adhesion. To validate the precision of our technique, histamine increased the resistance in subconfluent HUVECs in which there was no cell-cell contact. Exposure of confluent monolayers to an antibody against cadherin-5 caused a predominant decrease in cell-cell resistance, whereas the resistance was unaffected by the antibody to cadherin-5 in subconfluent cells. Furthermore, we observed an increase predominantly in cell-cell resistance in ECV304 cells that were transfected with a plasmid containing a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter controlling expression of E-cadherin. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed tens of nanometer displacements between adjacent cells at a time point in which histamine maximally decreased cell-cell resistance.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsukahara, H</author><author>Noiri, E</author><author>Jiang, M Z</author><author>Hiraoka, M</author><author>Mayumi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of nitric oxide in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell adhesion.</title><secondary-title>Life sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Life sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antisense</keyword><keyword>Antisense: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability</keyword><keyword>Capillary Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Chelating Agents</keyword><keyword>Chelating Agents: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cyclic GMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Enzyme Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins</keyword><keyword>Fibronectins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Lung</keyword><keyword>Lung: blood supply</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Donors</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Donors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide Synthase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Nitric Oxide: physiology</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotides</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Circulation</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Circulation: physiology</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10896023</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896023</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>We examined the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on cell adhesion using cultured human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC). Attachment of these cells to fibronectin was significantly inhibited by NO donors, spermine NONOate and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine or L-arginine, but not 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate. Similar results were obtained with the electrical cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) technique. Addition of NO donors or L-arginine, but not 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate or N2,2'-O-dibutyrylguanosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate, to confluent PMVEC monolayers resulted in a transient decrease in cell adhesion, which was quantitated by the ECIS. Exposure to 1 U/ml alpha-thrombin reduced the monolayer electrical resistance by approximately 50%. The observed response was significantly suppressed by pretreatment of cells with intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid or NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, but not guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 6-anilino-5,8-quinoline-quinone. Selective knockout of endothelial NO synthase with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides also significantly reduced thrombin-induced decrease in monolayer resistance. Our findings indicate that thrombin stimulates calcium-dependent release of NO from PMVEC, which mediates the retraction of endothelial cells via a cGMP-independent pathway. Our results suggest that NO modulates cell-matrix and/or cell-cell adhesion in PMVEC and that this molecule might modify microvascular permeability in the human lung.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegener, Joachim</author><author>Hakvoort, Ansgar</author><author>Galla, Hans Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Barrier function of porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells is modulated by cAMP-dependent pathways in vitro.</title><secondary-title>Brain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain research</full-title></periodical><pages>115-124</pages><volume>853</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Blood-Brain Barrier: physiology</keyword><keyword>Blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Choroid Plexus</keyword><keyword>Choroid Plexus: cytology</keyword><keyword>Choroid Plexus: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Choroid Plexus: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Choroid plexus epithelium</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: analogs &amp; derivatives</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Forskolin</keyword><keyword>Forskolin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Impedance analysis</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Permeability</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: physiology</keyword><keyword>Swine</keyword><keyword>Thionucleotides</keyword><keyword>Thionucleotides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Transepithelial electrical resistance</keyword><keyword>cAMP</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><isbn>0006-8993 (Print)\r0006-8993 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>10627315</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0006-8993(99)02317-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10627315</url></web-urls></urls><label>Blood Brain Barrier;ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER;ECIS Theory;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>In the present paper, we demonstrate that the barrier properties of primary cultured epithelial cells isolated from porcine choroid plexus are regulated by cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathways in vitro. Triggering cAMP-connected cascades in cell layers grown on permeable filters with cAMP-analogues or forskolin led to a significant increase of transepithelial electrical resistances and a pronounced reduction in the permeation rate of a 4 kDa-dextran probe. In dose-response experiments using the cAMP-analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP transepithelial electrical resistances were observed to increase above a threshold concentration ranging between 10(-5.5) and 10(-5) M. Additional impedance studies performed with confluent cell layers grown on gold-film electrodes revealed that the observed changes in transepithelial resistances and presumably also in macromolecular permeation rates were not entirely caused by a reinforcement of intercellular junctions but also contained contributions from changes in the cell-substrate adhesion pattern. These inherent contributions to the electrical resistance and macromolecular permeability are caused by a restricted diffusion pathway between basal plasma membrane and culture substrate that have to be considered in data analysis, especially when leaky cell layers on filter substrates with low pore densities are used.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl"

TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been proposed to be among the candidate factors with the most potential to play a role in ischemia-induced collateral vessel formation. Recently, we found that VEGF activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in cultured rat cardiac myocytes. To elucidate how VEGF affects adhesive interaction of cardiac myocytes with the extracellular matrix (ECM), one of the important cell functions, we investigated the molecular mechanism of activation of focal adhesion-related proteins, especially focal adhesion kinase (p125(FAK)), in cultured rat cardiac myocytes. We found that the 2 VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1, were expressed in cardiac myocytes and that KDR/Flk-1 was significantly tyrosine phosphorylated on VEGF stimulation. VEGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p125(FAK) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin; this was accompanied by subcellular translocation of p125(FAK) from perinuclear sites to the focal adhesions. This VEGF-induced activation of p125(FAK) was inhibited partially by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin. Activation of p125(FAK) was accompanied by its increased association with adapter proteins GRB2, Shc, and nonreceptor type tyrosine kinase p60(c-src). Furthermore, we confirmed that VEGF induced a significant increase in adhesive interaction between cardiac myocytes and ECM using an electric cell-substrate impedance sensor. These results strongly suggest that p125(FAK) is one of the most important components in VEGF-induced signaling in cardiac myocytes, playing a critical role in adhesive interaction between cardiac myocytes and ECM.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min M</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-substrate contact: another factor may influence transepithelial electrical resistance of cell layers cultured on permeable filters.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>576-580</pages><volume>250</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>Epithelial Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Micropore Filters</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Polycarboxylate Cement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10413610</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/excr.1999.4538</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10413610</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Transepithelial resistance (TER) measurement has often been used to study the paracellular transport properties of epithelia grown on permeable filters, especially the barrier function of tight junctions. However, the TER value includes another source, the resistance caused by cell-substrate contact, that may give rise to a high TER value if cell-substrate separation is small. In this study we use electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to measure both paracellular resistance and the average cell-substrate distance of MDCK (II), HEp-2, and WI-38 VA13 cells. Comparing ECIS data with those from TER measurements of cell layers cultured on polycarbonate filters, we can obtain the approximate extra resistance resulting from cell-substrate contact for each cell type. The value of cell-substrate resistance was also estimated by two theoretical calculations that bracket the true values. Our results demonstrate that cell-substrate contact substantially influences the TER data measured using polycarbonate filters and that the extra resistance due to cell-substrate spaces depends on both cell type and filter property.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegener, J</author><author>Zink, S</author><author>Rösen, P</author><author>Galla, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of electrochemical impedance measurements to monitor beta-adrenergic stimulation of bovine aortic endothelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Pflügers Archiv : European journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pflügers Archiv : European journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>925-934</pages><volume>437</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenylate Cyclase</keyword><keyword>Adenylate Cyclase: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Adrenergic</keyword><keyword>Adrenergic beta-Agonists</keyword><keyword>Adrenergic beta-Agonists: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aorta</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP</keyword><keyword>Cyclic AMP: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Isoproterenol</keyword><keyword>Isoproterenol: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword><keyword>beta</keyword><keyword>beta: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10370072</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10370072</url></web-urls></urls><label>Signal Transduction</label><abstract>Due to the high permeability of endothelial cell layers derived from macrovascular vessels, precise determination of their barrier function towards ion movement requires refined experimental techniques. We thus cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) directly on thin gold-film electrodes and measured the electrochemical impedance to study their passive electrical properties in general and during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Impedance spectra (10-2.10(6) Hz) of confluent cell monolayers revealed that the electrical characteristics of the cells can be modelled by a simple resistor-capacitor parallel network. Under control conditions the overall resistance of confluent BAEC monolayers was 3.6+/-0.6 Omega.cm2 (n=30) and the capacitance was 0. 6+/-0.1 microF/cm2. Both quantities are discussed with respect to morphological characteristics of these cells. Stimulation of BAECs with the synthetic beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol leads to a concentration-dependent, highly specific increase of the cell layer resistance characterized by a concentration for half-maximal response (EC50) of 0.3+/-0.1 microM. The cell layer capacitance, however, remained unaffected. Using impedance measurements at a single frequency, we analysed the response of BAECs to treatment with isoproterenol in comparison with several chemically unrelated compounds known to stimulate the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signal transduction cascade. These studies confirmed that the enhancement of the cell layer resistance after beta-adrenergic stimulation is mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellis, Chad A</author><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Sandoval, Raudel</author><author>Niles, Walter D</author><author>Malik, Asrar B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time course of recovery of endothelial cell surface thrombin receptor (PAR-1) expression.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>C38-45</pages><volume>276</volume><issue>1 Pt 1</issue><keywords><keyword>Calcium</keyword><keyword>Calcium: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Cell Size: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cycloheximide</keyword><keyword>Cycloheximide: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cytosol</keyword><keyword>Cytosol: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Dose-Response Relationship</keyword><keyword>Drug</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Osmolar Concentration</keyword><keyword>Protein Synthesis Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Synthesis Inhibitors: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Thrombin</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Thrombin: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>9886918</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9886918</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER;Signal Transduction</label><abstract>We studied dynamics of cell surface expression of proteolytically activated thrombin receptor (PAR-1) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC). PAR-1 activation was measured by changes in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and HPAEC retraction response (determined by real-time transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance). [Ca2+]i increase in response to thrombin was abolished by preexposure to 25 nM thrombin for &gt;60 min, indicating PAR-1 desensitization, but preexposure to 25 nM thrombin for only 30 min or to 10 nM thrombin for up to 2 h did not desensitize PAR-1. Exposure to 10 or 25 nM thrombin decreased monolayer electrical resistance 40-60%. Cells preexposed to 10 nM thrombin, but not those preexposed to 25 nM thrombin, remained responsive to thrombin 3 h later. Loss of cell retractility was coupled to decreased cell surface PAR-1 expression as determined by immunofluorescence. Cell surface PAR-1 disappeared upon short-term (30 min) thrombin exposure but reappeared within 90 min after incubation in thrombin-free medium. Exposure to 25 nM thrombin for &gt;60 min prevented rapid cycloheximide-insensitive PAR-1 reappearance. Cycloheximide-sensitive recovery of cell surface PAR-1 expression required 18 h. Therefore, both duration and concentration of thrombin exposure regulate the time course of recovery of HPAEC surface PAR-1 expression. The results support the hypothesis that initial recovery of PAR-1 surface expression in endothelial cells results from a rapidly mobilizable PAR-1 pool, whereas delayed recovery results from de novo PAR-1 synthesis. We conclude that thrombin itself regulates endothelial cell surface PAR-1 expression and that decreased surface expression interferes with thrombin-induced endothelial cell activation responses.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Ferrier, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrically measuring viscoelastic parameters of adherent cell layers under controlled magnetic forces.</title><secondary-title>European biophysics journal : EBJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European biophysics journal : EBJ</full-title></periodical><pages>112-118</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: methods</keyword><keyword>Magnetics</keyword><keyword>Mathematical Computing</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts</keyword><keyword>Osteoblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Viscosity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10028236</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10028236</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling</label><abstract>Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used to measure the time-dependence and frequency-dependence of impedance for current flowing underneath and between cells. Osteosarcoma cells with a topology similar to a short cylinder (coin-like) surmounted by a dome were used in this study. Application of a small step increase in net vertical stress to the cells (4 and 7 dyn/cm2), via magnetic beads bound to the dorsal (upper) surface, causes an increase in cell body height and an increase in cell-cell separation, as well as stretching of the cell-substrate adhesion bonds. This results in a fast drop in measured resistance (less than 2 s), followed by a slower change with a time constant of 60-150 s. This time constant is about 1.5 times longer at 22 degrees C than that at 37 degrees C; it also increases with applied stress. Our frequency scan data, as well as our data for the time course of resistance and capacitance, show that the fast change is associated with both the under-the-cells and between-the-cells resistance. The slower change in resistance mainly reflects the between-the-cells resistance. To obtain viscoelastic parameters from our data we use a simple viscoelastic model comprising viscous and elastic elements (i.e., dashpot and two springs) for the cell body, and an elastic element (a spring) for the cell-substrate adhesion system. Our results show that the spring constants and the viscosity of the cell body components of this viscoelastic model decrease as the temperature increases, whereas the elastic modulus of cell-substrate adhesion increases with temperature. At 37 degrees C, for the cell body we obtain a value of about 10(5) P for the viscous element of the viscoelastic model, and a spring constant expressed in units of an elastic modulus of about 10(4) dyn/cm2 for the spring in series with the viscous element, with another spring with a modulus of about 2 x 10(3) dyn/cm2 in parallel with these. In comparable units, we have a modulus for the cell-substrate adhesion system of about 3 x 10(3) dyn/cm2.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, C N</author><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Hsu, T C</author><author>Tsay, G J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sera from patients with scleroderma inhibit fibroblast micromotions monitored electrically.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of rheumatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of rheumatology</full-title></periodical><pages>1312-1317</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Division: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cell Size</keyword><keyword>Cell Size: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions</keyword><keyword>Intercellular Junctions: physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Scleroderma</keyword><keyword>Systemic</keyword><keyword>Systemic: blood</keyword><keyword>Systemic: pathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><accession-num>10381049</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10381049</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>To investigate scleroderma fibroblast behavior, and the effect of different human sera on fibroblast behavior, we established a model using the newly developed electrical biosensor, electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS).</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ko, Kevin S.-C</author><author>Lo, Chun-min</author><author>Ferrier, Jack</author><author>Hannam, Pauline</author><author>Tamura, Muneaki</author><author>McBride, Barry C</author><author>Ellen, Richard P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell–substrate impedance analysis of epithelial cell shape and micromotion upon challenge with bacterial proteins that perturb extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton</title><secondary-title>Journal of Microbiological Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Microbiological Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>125-132</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ecis</keyword><keyword>electrical cell</keyword><keyword>epithelial monolayer</keyword><keyword>major surface protein</keyword><keyword>micromotion</keyword><keyword>msp</keyword><keyword>proteinase</keyword><keyword>substrate impedance sensing</keyword><keyword>treponema denticola</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0167-7012(98)00083-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167701298000839</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Karra, N</author><author>Dillon, B</author><author>Goldberg, A M</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-substratum interactions as a predictor of cytotoxicity</title><secondary-title>In Vitro &amp;

Addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to culture medium elicits a dramatic change in orbital fibroblast morphology. That response is mediated through the generation of cAMP. Orbital fibroblasts can generate high levels of PGE2 through induction by proinflammatory cytokines of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2). Here we compare the influence on fibroblast morphology of exogenous PGE2, forskolin, and 8-br-cAMP to that mediated through PGHS-2 induction by a lymphocyte-derived cytokine. Within a few hours, orbital fibroblasts treated with any of these test compounds appear under phase-contrast microscopy to exhibit a stellate morphology. When these changes were assessed quantitatively by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), it became evident that 8-br-cAMP, forskolin, and PGE2 initiated shape changes within 30 min of addition to the culture medium, while effects of the cytokine were first evident after approximately 3.5 h. Dermal fibroblasts failed to respond to any of these compounds with regard to changes in cellular morphology. Analysis of micromotion, manifested as small impedance fluctuations, revealed that orbital fibroblasts treated with 8-br-cAMP exhibit less motion than did untreated cells. These results suggest that orbital fibroblast shape can be altered by several compounds known to alter intracellular cAMP levels. They demonstrate the utility of ECIS in the assessment of very rapid and dynamic cellular events associated with changes in cell morphology.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Glogauer, M</author><author>Rossi, M</author><author>Ferrier, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-substrate separation: effect of applied force and temperature.</title><secondary-title>European biophysics journal : EBJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European biophysics journal : EBJ</full-title></periodical><pages>9-17</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Bone Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Separation</keyword><keyword>Cell Separation: methods</keyword><keyword>Collagen</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Integrins</keyword><keyword>Integrins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Magnetics</keyword><keyword>Mathematical Computing</keyword><keyword>Microscopy</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma</keyword><keyword>Osteosarcoma: pathology</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><accession-num>9463886</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9463886</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS Theory</label><abstract>We measure the change in cell-substrate separation in response to an upward force by combining two relatively new techniques, Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) to measure average cell-substrate separation, and collagen-coated magnetic beads to apply force to the top (dorsal) surface of cells. The collagen-coated ferric oxide beads attach to integrin receptors in the dorsal surfaces of osteoblastlike ROS 17/2.8 cells. Magnetic force is controlled by the position and the number of permanent magnets, applying an average 320 or 560 pN per cell. Comparing model calculations with experimental impedance data, the junctional resistivity of the cell layer and the average distance between the lower (ventral) cell surface and substrate can be determined. The ECIS analysis shows that these forces produce an increase in the distance between the ventral cell surface and the substrate that is in the range of 10 to 25%. At temperatures of 4 degrees, 22 degrees and 37 degrees C, the measured cell surface-substrate distances without magnetic beads are 84 +/- 4, 45 +/- 2 and 38 +/- 2 nm. The force-induced changes at 22 degrees are 11 +/- 3 and 21 +/- 3 nm for 320 and 560 pN, and at 37 degrees they are 5 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 2 nm. The resulting cell-substrate spring constants at 22 degrees and 37 degrees are thus about 28 and 63 pN nm-1 (dyne cm-1). Using a reasonable range for the number for individual integrin-ligand adhesion bonds gives a range for the spring constant of the individual adhesion bond of from about 10(-3) to 10(-1) pN nm-1. These data also provide evidence that the number of adhesion bonds per cell increases with temperature.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Ferrier, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of fibroblastic cell layers measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing</title><secondary-title>Physical Review E</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physical Review E</full-title></periodical><pages>6982</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><publisher>APS</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v57/i6/p6982_1</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS Theory</label><abstract>Impedance measurements of cell layers cultured on gold electrode surfaces obtained by electric cellsubstrate impedance sensing provide morphological information such as junctional resistance and cell-substrate separation. Previously, a model that assumes that cells have a disklike shape and that electric currents flow radially underneath the ventral cell surface and then through the paracellular space has been used to theoretically calculate the impedance of the cell-covered electrode. In this paper we propose an extended model of impedance analysis for cell layers where cellular shape is rectangular. This is especially appropriate for normal fibroblasts in culture. To verify the model, we analyze impedance data obtained from four different kinds of fibroblasts that display a long rectangular shape. In addition, we measure the average cell-substrate separation of human gingival fibroblasts at different temperatures. At temperatures of 37, 22, and 4 °C, the average separation between ventral cell surface and substratum are 46, 55, and 89 nm, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Katahira, Jun</author><author>Sugiyama, Hiromu</author><author>Inoue, Norimitsu</author><author>Horiguchi, Yasuhiko</author><author>Matsuda, Morihiro</author><author>Sugimoto, Nakaba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin utilizes two structurally related membrane proteins as functional receptors in vivo</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>26652-26658</pages><volume>272</volume><issue>42</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.272.42.26652</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Human and mouse cDNAs showing homology to the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) receptor gene (CPE-R) from Vero cells (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank(TM) accession no.

They were classified into two groups, the Vero cell CPE receptor homologues and rat androgen withdrawal apoptosis protein (RVP1; accession no. M74067) homologues, based on the similarities of primary amino acid sequences. L929 cells that were originally insensitive to CPE became sensitive to CPE on their transfection with cDNAs encoding either the CPE receptor or RVP1 homologues, indicating that these gene products are not only structurally similar but also functionally active as receptors for CPE. By binding assay, the human RVP1 homologue showed differences in affinity and capacity of binding from those of the human CPE receptor. Northern blot analysis showed that mouse homologues of the CPE receptor and RVP1 are expressed abundantly in mouse small intestine. The expression of CPE-R mRNA in the small intestine was restricted to cryptic enterocytes, indicating that the CPE receptor is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. These results are consistent with reports that CPE binds to the small intestinal cells via two different kinds of receptors. High levels of expression of CPE-R and/or RVP1 mRNA were also detected in other organs, including the lungs, liver, and kidneys, but only low levels were expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. These results indicate that CPE uses structurally related cellular proteins as functional receptors in vivo and that organs that have not so far been recognized as CPE-sensitive have the potential to be targets of CPE.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiruppathi, Chinnaswamy</author><author>Song, W</author><author>Bergenfeldt, M</author><author>Sass, P</author><author>Malik, a B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gp60 activation mediates albumin transcytosis in endothelial cells by tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>25968-25975</pages><volume>272</volume><issue>41</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Transport</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Caveolin 1</keyword><keyword>Caveolins</keyword><keyword>Endocytosis</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Antibody Technique</keyword><keyword>Indirect</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein-Tyrosine Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src): metabolism</keyword><keyword>Serum Albumin</keyword><keyword>Serum Albumin: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sialoglycoproteins</keyword><keyword>Sialoglycoproteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Surface Properties</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: metabolism</keyword><keyword>src Homology Domains</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><isbn>3123550249</isbn><accession-num>9325331</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9325331</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>We investigated the function of gp60, an endothelial cell membrane 60-kDa albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae, and the mechanism of its activation in regulating endothelial permeability of albumin. Gp60 organization on the bovine pulmonary microvessel endothelial cell (BPMVEC) surface was punctate as shown by immunofluorescence using an anti-gp60 antibody (Ab) conjugated with bisfunctional, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl fluorophore (Cy3). Addition of a secondary Ab to anti-gp60 Ab-treated BPMVEC induced cross-linking of gp60 as evident by increased size of fluorescent particles and cell surface gp60 clustering. Gp60 cross-linking also produced 2-3-fold increases in the endothelial cell uptake and the luminal to abluminal permeability of 125I-albumin as well as the fluid-phase tracer, horseradish peroxidase. The increased transendothelial permeability of macromolecules was the result of transcytosis as it was not associated with an increase in the paracellular pathway. Incubation of anti-gp60 Ab with BPMVEC at 37 degrees C caused internalization of gp60, and thereby reduced the uptake of the macromolecules. Activation of gp60 by either albumin (the gp60 ligand) or gp60 cross-linking induced the phosphorylation of both gp60 and caveolin-1 (the major structural caveolar protein) on tyrosine residues. Gp60 activation also phosphorylated the Src family tyrosine kinases pp60(c-Src) and Fyn. The activated pp60(c-Src) and Fyn co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 in BPMVEC membrane. Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors, herbimycin A and genistein, prevented gp60-activated macromolecule uptake and transcytosis in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the functional significance of the PTK pathway in activating albumin transcytosis. These findings indicate that activation of gp60 stimulates the Src PTK signaling pathway, and thus regulates the transcytosis of albumin across the endothelial cell monolayer.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patil, Sandeep</author><author>Kaplan, John E</author><author>Minnear, Fred L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein, not adenosine or adenine nucleotides, mediates platelet decrease in endothelial permeability.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>H2304-11</pages><volume>273</volume><issue>5 Pt 2</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenine Nucleotides</keyword><keyword>Adenine Nucleotides: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Deaminase</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Deaminase: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Diphosphate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Monophosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Monophosphate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Triphosphate</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Triphosphate: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Adenosine: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets</keyword><keyword>Blood Platelets: physiology</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Blood Proteins: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Conditioned</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Artery</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: drug effects</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword><keyword>Xanthines</keyword><keyword>Xanthines: pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><accession-num>9374767</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9374767</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS TEER</label><abstract>Platelets and platelet-conditioned medium (PCM) decrease endothelial protein permeability in vitro. Adenosine and a &gt; 100-kDa protein have previously been implicated as the soluble factors released from platelets that decrease endothelial permeability. The objective of this study was to further investigate the role of adenosine in this platelet response. Measurements of adenosine and its precursor adenine nucleotides by high-performance liquid chromatography were correlated with the assessment of permeability by 125I-labeled albumin clearance and electrical resistance across endothelial cell monolayers derived from the bovine pulmonary artery. PCM contained micromolar concentrations of AMP, ADP, and ATP, but adenosine was below detectable levels (&lt; or = 0.1 microM). Adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that converts adenosine to inactive inosine, or an adenosine-receptor antagonist did not block the platelet- or PCM-mediated decrease in endothelial permeability. A &lt; 3-kDa fraction of PCM that contained micromolar concentrations of AMP and ADP did not affect endothelial permeability, whereas a &gt; 3-kDa fraction that contained much reduced levels of AMP and ADP significantly decreased permeability. This activity of PCM was sensitive to insoluble trypsin. This study rules out adenosine and adenine nucleotides as primary factors in the platelet-induced decrease in endothelial permeability and suggests that the active factor is a protein.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Robinson, Joseph R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Vitro Methods for Measuring Permeability of the Oral Mucosa</title><secondary-title>Oral Mucosal Drug Delivery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oral Mucosal Drug Delivery</full-title></periodical><pages>85-96</pages><keywords><keyword>bednarek</keyword><keyword>cent tracer</keyword><keyword>citation</keyword><keyword>dysfunction</keyword><keyword>endothelium</keyword><keyword>epithelium</keyword><keyword>fluores-</keyword><keyword>in vitro</keyword><keyword>methods for measuring the</keyword><keyword>microfluidics</keyword><keyword>permeability</keyword><keyword>r</keyword><keyword>transendothelial resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://In Vitro Methods for Measuring the Permeability of Cell Monolayers.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impedance analysis of MDCK cells measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing.</title><secondary-title>Biophysical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biophysical journal</full-title></periodical><pages>2800-2807</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane: physiology</keyword><keyword>Dogs</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: methods</keyword><keyword>Epithelium</keyword><keyword>Epithelium: physiology</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Kidney</keyword><keyword>Mathematics</keyword><keyword>Microelectrodes</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><accession-num>8599686</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80153-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1236517&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Modeling;ECIS Theory</label><abstract>Transepithelial impedance of Madin-Darby canine kidney cell layers is measured by a new instrumental method, referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. In this method, cells are cultured on small evaporated gold electrodes, and the impedance is measured in the frequency range 20-50,000 Hz by a small probing current. A model for impedance analysis of epithelial cells measured by this method is developed. The model considers three different pathways for the current flowing from the electrode through the cell layer: (1) in through the basal and out through the apical membrane, (2) in through the lateral and out through the apical membrane, and (3) between the cells through the paracellular space. By comparing model calculation with experimental impedance data, several morphological and cellular parameters can be determined: (1) the resistivity of the cell layer, (2) the average distance between the basal cell surface and substratum, and (3) the capacitance of apical, basal, and lateral cell membranes. This model is used to analyze impedance changes on removal of Ca2+ from confluent Mardin-Darby canine kidney cell layers. The method shows that reduction of Ca2+ concentration causes junction resistance between cells to drop and the distance between the basal cell surface and substratum to increase.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghosh, Paramita</author><author>Keese, Charles R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Morphological response of mammalian cells to pulsed ac fields</title><secondary-title>Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics</full-title></periodical><pages>121-133</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/0302-4598(94)85003-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/0302-4598(94)85003-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Theory</label><abstract>A newly developed method of detecting morphology and morphological changes of adherent mammalian cells cultured on thin film gold electrodes (electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing) has been used to measure the response of cells to external electrical stimuli. When sufficiently high ac voltage pulses were applied, the impedance of the cell layer changed reproducibly, indicating morphological changes in the cell layer, as no such impedance changes were seen with cell-free electrodes. The response increased with increasing voltage pulses and was distinct for different cell types. The threshold voltage across the cell layer causing an observable change was found to be of the order of 0.1 V, which is higher than that reported by others using dc fields. In certain cases, it was found that the impedance of the cell layer decreased upon pulsation and then started to recover, but decreased again before finally recovering. This suggests that two different events cause a drop in impedance of the cell layer when the adherent mammalian cells are transiently exposed to an external electrical field.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Chun-Min</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>pH changes in pulsed CO2 incubators cause periodic changes in cell morphology.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>391-397</pages><volume>213</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carbon Dioxide</keyword><keyword>Carbon Dioxide: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Culture Media</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cultured: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cultured: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Fourier Analysis</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>8050495</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/excr.1994.1214</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482784712146</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8050495</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>It is common in animal cell culture to utilize media that are buffered with bicarbonate ions and elevated CO2 concentrations in the incubator gas. Many modern incubators maintain these concentrations by monitoring the level of CO2 and injecting the gas when the value drops below a certain set point. This feedback system results in small oscillations in the incubator CO2 concentration of about 0.5%, resulting in oscillating pH values in the medium bathing the cells. These oscillations are very small and cannot be detected using a standard pH combination electrode, and until now no one has noticed any effect on the cells. In this study, however, we demonstrate that these periodic changes can result in detectable changes in cell morphology and therefore do affect cell behavior. Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to detect subtle alterations in cell morphology, we have measured cellular changes that when analyzed with the Fast Fourier Transform have a periodicity that matches those of the CO2 addition. This effect becomes particularly prominent when the culture medium has been acidified by cell metabolism reducing the liquid's buffer capacity. We have further analyzed the cyclical morphological changes employing a model of cell-electrode interactions in the ECIS measurement. We conclude that: (1) the periodic changes in cell morphology are most apparent if the medium is partially spent and if the surface to volume ratio of the culture vessel is high and (2) for confluent WI-38/VA13 fibroblasts and bovine pulmonary endothelial cells (B3B3), the main periodic morphological changes manifest themselves primarily as alterations in paracellular resistance.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pei, Z</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author><author>Kurzawa, H</author><author>Wilson, D E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of the pSV2-neo plasmid on NIH 3T3 cell motion detected electrically.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>225-229</pages><volume>212</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>3T3 Cells</keyword><keyword>3T3 Cells: cytology</keyword><keyword>3T3 Cells: physiology</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Restriction Mapping</keyword><keyword>Structure-Activity Relationship</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>8187817</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/excr.1994.1138</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8187817</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Advantage was taken of DNA transfection techniques to investigate the effect of the pSV2-neo plasmid and its derivatives on recipient NIH 3T3 cell motion. Cell spreading and motion were followed by a newly developed electrical method to monitor cell morphology, referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Using this method, we found that the eukaryotic-prokaryotic shuttle vector pSV2-neo had a strong effect on the recipient NIH 3T3 cell spreading and cell motion. However, two new neo plasmids, pSK-neo and pSP-neo, which were constructed by modifying the pSV2-neo plasmid, did not have a significant effect on the recipient cell activities. The results suggest that there may be some sequences in pSV2-neo which affect recipient cell behavior.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, Ivar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A biosensor that monitors cell morphology with electrical fields</title><secondary-title>IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine</full-title></periodical><pages>402-408</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/51.294012</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (

The heart of this method, called ECIS for electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, is a small gold electrode immersed in tissue culture medium. When cells attach and spread on this electrode, the measured electrical impedance changes because the cells constrain the current flow. This changing impedance can be interpreted to reveal useful information about cell behaviors. Since these behaviors, such as spreading and locomotion, involve the coordination of many biochemical reactions, they are extremely sensitive to most external parameters such as temperature, pH, and a myriad of chemical compounds. This broad response to changes in the environment allows this method to serve as a general biosensor. The measurements are easily automated, and the general conditions of the cells can be monitored by a personal computer controlling the necessary instrumentation</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, C M</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring motion of confluent cells in tissue culture.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>102-109</pages><volume>204</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin D</keyword><keyword>Cytochalasin D: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Glucose</keyword><keyword>Glucose: pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Methods</keyword><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>8416788</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/excr.1993.1014</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8416788</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>Cell movements in confluent fibroblastic cell layers have been followed with a new instrumental method. Using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS), cell motions on the scale of nanometers are manifested as fluctuations in the impedance of small gold film electrodes that serve as cell substrata. These fluctuations have been recorded and numerically processed for cells at 27 and 37 degrees C, for cells deprived of all external nutrients over extended periods of time, and for cells exposed to different levels of cytochalasin D. Results suggest that the movements in confluent layers detected via ECIS can be correlated with cell metabolic activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghosh, P M</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring electropermeabilization in the plasma membrane of adherent mammalian cells.</title><secondary-title>Biophysical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biophysical journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1602-1609</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biophysical Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Biophysics</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane Permeability: physiology</keyword><keyword>Electric Impedance</keyword><keyword>Electric Stimulation</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Membrane Potentials</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>8324195</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81531-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1262488&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Electroporation</label><abstract>When an electrical potential of order one volt is induced across a cell membrane for a fraction of a second, temporary breakdown of ordinary membrane functions may occur. One result of such a breakdown is that molecules normally excluded by the membrane can now enter the cells. This phenomenon, generally referred to as electropermeabilization, is known as electroporation when actual pores form in the membrane. This paper presents a unique approach to the measurement of pore formation and closure in anchored mammalian cells. The cells are cultured on small gold electrodes, and by constantly monitoring the impedance of the electrode with a low-amplitude AC signal, small changes in cell morphology, cell motion, and membrane resistance can be detected. Because the active electrode is small, the application of a few volts across the cell-covered electrode causes pore formation in the cell membrane. In addition, the heat transfer is very efficient, and the cells can be porated in their regular growth medium. By this method, the formation and resealing of pores due to applied electric fields can be followed in real time for anchorage-dependent cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giaever, I</author><author>Keese, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A morphological biosensor for mammalian cells.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>591-592</pages><volume>366</volume><issue>6455</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenocarcinoma</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biosensing Techniques</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Cultured: cytology</keyword><keyword>Cultured: physiology</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: methods</keyword><keyword>Endothelium</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: cytology</keyword><keyword>Macrophages: physiology</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mammals</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Prostatic Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Tumor Cells</keyword><keyword>Vascular</keyword><keyword>Vascular: cytology</keyword><keyword>Vascular: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>8255299</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/366591a0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/8255299</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8255299</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment;ECIS Cytotoxicity;ECIS Micromotion</label><abstract>An electrical biosensor is described that can continuously track morphological changes of adherent cells providing quantitative data from both sparse and confluent cultures.

Endothelial shape changes were quantified by using a monolayer of endothelial cells grown on a small (10(-3) cm2) evaporated gold electrode and measuring the changes in electrical impedance. Bovine pulmonary microvessel endothelial cells and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were used to study the effects of alpha-thrombin on cell-shape dynamics by the impedance measurement. alpha-Thrombin produced a dose-dependent decrease in impedance that occurred within 0.5 min in both cell types, indicative of retraction of endothelial cells and widening of interendothelial junctions because of &quot;rounding up&quot; of the cells. The alpha-thrombin-induced decrease in impedance persisted for approximately 2 hr, after which the value recovered to basal levels. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, or with 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate prevented the decreased impedance, suggesting that the endothelial cell change is modulated by activation of second-messenger pathways. The alpha-thrombin-induced decrease in impedance was in agreement with the previously observed increases in transendothelial albumin permeability and evidence of formation of intercellular gaps after alpha-thrombin challenge. The impedance measurement may be a valuable in vitro method for the assessment of mechanisms of decreased endothelial barrier function occurring with inflammatory mediators. Since the rapidly occurring changes in endothelial cell shape in response to mediators such as thrombin are mediated activation of second-messenger pathways, the ability to monitor endothelial cell dynamics in real time may provide insights into the signal-transduction events mediating the increased endothelial permeability.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitra, P</author><author>Keese, C R</author><author>Giaever, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric measurements can be used to monitor the attachment and spreading of cells in tissue culture.</title><secondary-title>BioTechniques</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioTechniques</full-title></periodical><pages>504-510</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cytological Techniques</keyword><keyword>Electrodes</keyword><keyword>Gold</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Methods</keyword><keyword>Polystyrenes</keyword><keyword>Transformed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>1793585</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1793585</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A new electrical assay to measure the attachment and spreading of cells in tissue culture has been developed and substantiated by comparison with a more conventional assay. Small gold electrodes are vacuum deposited on the bottom of standard polystyrene culture dishes and coated with various proteins. As mammalian fibroblasts attach and spread on these surfaces, the measured impedance of the electrodes changes. These impedance changes reflect the amount of area blocked by the spreading cells. Since the weak electrical signals used have no noticeable effects on the cells, this is a very convenient method that is both quantitative and sensitive for measuring cell attachment and spreading.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giaever, I</author><author>Keese, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Micromotion of mammalian cells measured electrically.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>7896-7900</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Culture Techniques</keyword><keyword>Culture Techniques: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Culture Techniques: methods</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Electrophysiology: methods</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mathematics</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>1881923</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=52411&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion;Modeling</label><abstract>Motility is a fundamental property of mammalian cells that normally is observed in tissue culture by time lapse microscopy where resolution is limited by the wavelength of light. This paper examines a powerful electrical technique by which cell motion is quantitatively measured at the nanometer level. In this method, the cells are cultured on small evaporated gold electrodes carrying weak ac currents. A large change in the measured electrical impedance of the electrodes is observed when cells attach and spread on these electrodes. When the impedance is tracked as a function of time, fluctuations are observed that are a direct measure of cell motion. Surprisingly, these fluctuations continue even when the cell layer becomes confluent. By comparing the measured impedance with a theoretical model, it is clear that under these circumstances the average motions of the cell layer of 1 nm can be inferred from the measurements. We refer to this aspect of cell motility as micromotion.</abstract></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giaever, Ivar</author><author>Keese, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fractal motion of mammalian cells</title><secondary-title>Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena</full-title></periodical><pages>128-133</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1989</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0167-2789(89)90182-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0167278989901826</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Micromotion</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giaever, I</author><author>Keese, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of electric fields to monitor the dynamical aspect of cell behavior in tissue culture.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>242-247</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Communication</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Electrochemistry: instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microelectrodes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1986</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><accession-num>3957373</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TBME.1986.325896</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4122265</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3957373</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Attachment</label></record><record><database name="publications.enl" path="publications.enl">publications.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giaever, I</author><author>Keese, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring fibroblast behavior in tissue culture with an applied electric field.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>3761-3764</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Movement</keyword><keyword>Cells</keyword><keyword>Cultured</keyword><keyword>Electricity</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts</keyword><keyword>Fibroblasts: physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year></dates><accession-num>6587391</accession-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ECIS 1st Paper.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=345299&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECIS Theory</label><abstract>Mammalian fibroblasts have been cultured on evaporated gold electrodes subjected to an alternating electric field at 4000 Hz.
